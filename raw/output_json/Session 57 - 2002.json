Allow me at the\n23\n\noutset to extend my warmest congratulations to Mr. Jan\nKavan on his well-deserved election to the presidency.\nThe tragic events of 11 September have made us\nreconsider our achievements, real values, and the links\nbetween poverty, development, sustainability, respect\nfor human rights and real progress. Yet, the goals\nenvisioned by the perpetrators of those crimes have\ncertainly not been fulfilled. The world has become\nmore united and more determined to fight terrorism as\na global threat to the values of civilization. The result\nis increased cooperation among specialized services\nand bodies of different States, as well as international\norganizations. However, we must be prepared for a\nlong and exhausting confrontation with this evil of our\ntimes.\nLast year we were all rightly focused on\nAfghanistan. Today we are concerned also about future\nsteps regarding Iraq as a great threat to world stability\nand a shelter for terrorism. Fortunately, after a decade\nof being in focus as a crisis area, that South-Eastern\nEurope, the Balkans, along with Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, as the heart of the region, are no longer\n\u201cCNN-able\u201d, given the present growing stability.\nThe time has come to salute the new image of my\ncountry and to start re-branding the perception of the\nregion as a whole, which no longer fits anymore the\n\u201cBalkan ghosts\u201d stereotype. Great concerns such as\nIraq, the Middle East and Kashmir should not let us\nforget that the Balkan region is bearing good news. We\nare all striving to finish the job of fully integrating the\nregion into European democratic structures and values.\nEnormous efforts and achievements are behind\nus, but we have to be careful and patient until stability\nbecomes self-sustainable through the building of jobs,\njustice and functioning institutions, which will hold\ntogether new democracy.\nIn the light of last year's terrorist attacks on New\nYork and Washington, our fragile State \u2014 the only\nEuropean State where Muslims represent the majority\nreligious group \u2014 was confronted with the heavy\npressure of prejudice regarding a \u201cclash between\ncivilizations\u201d. But, as members may know, I come from\na State that represented a crossroads of different\ncultures and religions, where different civilizations\nlived for centuries in tolerance and mutual respect.\nToday we are even more convinced that all\nproblems can be solved only through dialogue based on\ngood political will. From that position we have joined\nthe fight against terrorism and organized crime of all\nkinds. We have heightened our struggle against\ncorruption by upgrading and strengthening our State\ninstitutions. We have placed the rule of law at the top\nof the agenda. Good work has been done, results have\nbeen achieved and we have thus proved that Bosnia\nand Herzegovina is not a no-man's land.\nBuilding democratic institutions, economic\ndevelopment and the protection and promotion of\nhuman rights are more than ever at the top of our\npriorities. Following the recent tragic events and all the\nturbulent changes that Bosnia and Herzegovina has\nexperienced, we strongly believe in the paradigm of\ndemocracy, development and peace as the pillars of\nprogress and stability for my country, but also for the\nimmediate neighbourhood and region as well. Only\nresponsible and accountable governance can bring\nabout necessary changes and progress for all.\nUnfortunately, we are still confronted with the\nheavy legacy of the past, and especially with the fact\nthat the main culprits for the crimes committed in\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko\nMladic, are at large. The moment they are brought to\njustice, it will be easier to reach our goals. That is why\nI would like at this juncture to emphasize the\nimportance of cooperation by all sides concerned with\nthe International Criminal Tribunal for the former\nYugoslavia in The Hague.\nAt the same time we are aware that\ndemocratization is sometimes a long process. Post-\nconflict peace-building is even more complex. But, we\nhave set the vision for developing a safe, peaceful,\nstable and self-sustainable country, and we shall not\nstop half way. Today, we are a full member of the\nCouncil of Europe. More refugees and displaced\npersons have returned in recent times as compared to\nany other post-war period. In other words, in the last 18\nmonths almost three times more properties, homes and\napartments were given back to refugees and displaced\npersons all over Bosnia and Herzegovina than in the\nprevious five years. Many roads, many villages, many\nroofs were built or repaired; many mosques and\nchurches have also been built or repaired.\nThe contribution of the United Nations Mission in\nBosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH), the Stabilization\nForce, the High Representative, the Peace\nImplementation Council, the Office of the United\n24\n\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),\nthe Organization for Security and Co-operation in\nEurope (OSCE) and others in the family of the\ninternational community present in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina has been substantial in achieving the\npresent level of stability and reconstruction.\nWe particularly recognize the value and the role\nof UNMIBH which is completing its mandate at the\nend of this year. The police reform and restructuring,\nwith a view to meeting international standards of\norganizational capacity and institutional integrity,\nrepresents a clear success. The United Nations Mission\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina was certainly one of the\nkey players also in establishing the foundation for\neffective, democratic and sustainable law enforcement\nagencies, a fundamental element for the further\ndevelopment of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a multi-\nethnic, tolerant and democratic State. We welcome the\ntransfer of the remaining tasks in this area to the\nEuropean Union Police Mission, and especially the\nextension of the European Union responsibility in the\narea of juridical reform as one of the basic pillars of\nself-sustainability, future democratization and the\nreform process.\nThere should be no doubt that the United Nations\nhas the potential to fulfil its new tasks and thus respond\nto the ever increasing challenges of the fast-changing\nworld. It should provide leadership in building a\nprosperous world, founded no longer on force and\nthreats, but on the rules of international law and respect\nfor all rights, and rights for all.\nIn that context I would like to underline that we\nsupport the further democratization and modernization\nof the United Nations. New tasks and challenges call\nincreasing efficiency, cost rationalization and the equal\ngeographic participation of States and peoples in the\nUnited Nations system. Bosnia and Herzegovina also\nsupports the continuation of work on reforming the\nSecurity Council, adjusting its membership in\naccordance with carefully designed criteria, taking into\naccount equal geographic representation but not\njeopardizing the efficiency of that United Nations\nbody.\nAllow me to briefly mention some of the\npriorities of today's Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnia\nand Herzegovina has in the past two years proved its\ndetermination to move from the position of passive aid\nrecipient from the international community to the\nposition of contributor to international efforts. The fact\nthat we are in a position to consider the need or even\nthe imperative of taking a more active and creative\nrole, and thus a bigger share of responsibility, testifies\nto the trend of normalization of the situation in the\ncountry.\nReconstruction is taking place and results are\nvisible in the economy, social reforms, education,\nhealth care and so on. Economic reforms are directed\ntowards the establishment of a single economic space\nand also with a view to setting up conditions for\nupgraded education and thus to offering the choice for\nour young generations to remain in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina and become the frontrunners of its\ndevelopment and future.\nWe have almost fully completed the conditions\nset out in the European Union's road map, which we\nhope will soon open the process of a feasibility study\nfor Bosnia and Herzegovina's signing of a stabilization\nand association agreement with the European Union.\nWe have gone through the process of being the object\nof international efforts and are now the partner in the\nprocess of making an economically and institutionally\nself-sustainable State of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This\nis only one phase in a process of finally becoming the\nowner of the changes in our country.\nIn partnership with the international community,\nwe are streamlining a common strategy for political\nstability, institution-building and an economic recovery\nprogramme as the precondition of overall sustainable\ndevelopment. The entire region, including Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, is entering a new stage of stability and\nthe European integration process, but we still have to\nbe on the alert. The ghosts of the past, segregation and\nwars are losing ground.\nIn following the trials of war criminals before the\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former\nYugoslavia in The Hague, we are bearing witness to the\nhope that justice and the future will finally bury\nprojects based on genocide. That is why we have to act\non a daily basis against those who are trying to open\nthe box of drawing new maps or calling for new wars\nin the region.\nSo much energy and so many efforts of the local\nand international communities have been invested so\nfar that we are not even allowed to consider anything\nbut a strategy for success. Any type of hypothetical exit\nstrategy of the international community can be based\n25\n\nonly on a success strategy in building one multiethnic,\ndemocratic and European State of Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. Once again, I would like to express the\ngratitude of my Government to the international\ncommunity for its devoted support towards long-lasting\nstability and development in the region.\nIf the four million people of my country \u2014\nMuslims, Orthodox Catholics, Jews and others who\nhistorically lived in tolerance, even in a non-\ndemocratic environment \u2014 cannot now live in a\ndemocratic and open society in the middle of Europe,\nthen the logical question after 11 September is: How\nwe can be consolidated and organized among the six\nbillion people of our planet?\nComing from Bosnia and Herzegovina, I am\ndriven by the force of optimism and the strength of\nvision shared by the overall majority of those who do\nnot want to repeat the past, but are ready to fight for\nthe future. Jobs, justice for all, solidarity and Europe,\nthrough reforms and strong state institutions, are the\nitems on our agenda today. We are determined to turn\nthese words into deeds.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI\nam pleased to open my statement by extending warm\ncongratulations to you, Sir, and to your friendly\ncountry, the Czech Republic, on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh\nsession. We wish you success at the helm of this\nAssembly, which is convened against a backdrop of\ncomplex circumstances and daunting global challenges.\nLet me assure you of my delegation's full commitment\nto cooperating with you in order to facilitate the\nfulfilment of your mandate.\nI wish to extend a word of thanks and tribute to\nyour predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, for his prudent\nand efficient stewardship of the previous session. In the\nsame vein, I wish to reiterate our appreciation for the\noutstanding performance of Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan and for his tireless and concrete efforts to\nenhance the effectiveness of the world Organization in\nserving global peace, security and development.\nKuwait welcomes the admission of the Swiss\nConfederation to the membership of our Organization.\nWe are confident that Switzerland's membership will\nenhance the benefits of its already active role in\nsupporting various United Nations programmes and\nactivities and will further consolidate the principles and\npurposes of the Charter, particularly as that country is\nhost to many United Nations bodies and specialized\nagencies.\nThe events of 11 September 2001 in the United\nStates, together with their consequences and\nimplications, have changed the global landscape and\nhave created a multitude of new challenges for the\nentire world, as we are now collectively entrenched in\nour fight against terrorism, violence and extremism.\nExperience has shown that combating this pernicious\nphenomenon is a universal responsibility and that no\nindividual country alone, irrespective of its resources\nor determination, can eliminate it.\nMoral and practical reasons make it unacceptable\nto link that curse to any particular nation, religion or\nculture. Such an attempt does not serve any of our\ncommon goals. To the contrary, it will deepen political\nand cultural divides, exacerbate the crisis and\ntransform it into a conflict among civilizations that\nharms us all and from which we have nothing to gain.\nTherefore, the United Nations remains the most\nappropriate and effective mechanism for studying and\nanalysing that phenomenon, so as to identify its causes\nand parameters and to coordinate efforts with a view to\ndeveloping guidelines for effective measures to\neradicate that plague.\nThe United Nations is also the appropriate body\nto define our responsibilities and obligations in that\nregard. The signing, ratification and scrupulous\nenforcement by all Member States of the 12 United\nNations instruments aimed at combating terrorism are\nperhaps the most viable means for establishing a solid\ncommon ground to combat and conquer terrorism.\nIn that context, I wish to take this opportunity to\nexpress once again our condolences and sympathy to\nthe friendly people and Government of the United\nStates and to the families of all the victims of that\nheinous act of terrorism. We share with them their\nanguish and the hope that their fortitude will help them\novercome their pain and loss.\nIn the meantime, Kuwait reaffirms its\nlongstanding core position condemning all acts of\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We also\ncategorically renounce all acts of violence and\nextremism, as they contravene not only international\nnorms and treaties but also the tolerant teachings of\nIslam and its compassionate value system, as well as\nother religions, humanitarian concepts and civilized\nvalues.\n12\n\nKuwait welcomes Security Council resolution\n1373 (2001) within the context of Kuwait's cooperation\nwith the ongoing international efforts to fight terrorism\nand, pursuant to its provisions, has put a number of\nimportant new steps and measures into effect. They\ninclude the enactment of a bill to combat money\nlaundering and the adoption of practical measures to\nregulate fund-raising activities in order to ensure that\nthose activities are not exploited or illegally used for\nany objective other than their legitimate and declared\nintent. Furthermore, for its part, Kuwait has answered\nall the queries of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism\nCommittee. We have provided to the Committee all the\ninformation and notations that clarify our national laws\nand legislation enacted by the Government to combat\nterrorist acts and to prosecute their perpetrators.\nWithin the same context and in order to\nconsolidate world efforts in combating terrorism, I\nwish to reiterate Kuwait's support for the idea of\nconvening an international conference under the\nauspices of the United Nations aimed at reaching an\nagreement on a clear and specific definition of\nterrorism. The primary purpose of that aim is to\ndistinguish between terrorism as a phenomenon that\nendangers international peace and security and the\nright of peoples to legitimate struggle in resisting\nforeign occupation in order to attain their rights to self-\ndetermination, as set forth in the Charter and in\ninternational law.\nIn this regard, Kuwait condemns the insidious\ncampaign orchestrated against our sister State, the\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, by certain American and\nWestern media sectors. For our part, however, we pay\ntribute to the Kingdom for its valuable role and\nsignificant contributions to the fight against terrorism\nand to efforts to achieve peace and security in the\nregion.\nThe success of our global efforts to eradicate\nterrorism depends in large measure on the ability of the\ninternational community to effectively address major\nissues and challenges that have become a source of\ndespair, misery, frustration, isolation and perceived\ninjustice felt by a number of people in all parts of the\nworld.\nAn elusive challenge that continues to stand out is\nthe constant deterioration of the situation in the\noccupied Palestinian territories. The escalating\nconfrontations have reached a level that threatens\npeace and security in the Middle East region as a\nwhole. The brutal practices of the Israeli occupation\nforces, including the unwarranted excessive use of\nforce against the Palestinian people, the deliberate\ndestruction of the institutions and infrastructure of the\nPalestinian Authority, in clear violation of United\nNations resolutions and the Fourth Geneva Convention\nof 1949, have resulted in exacerbating the economic\nand social crises sustained by the Palestinians for more\nthan five decades. Large-scale round-ups, house\ndemolitions, curfews, bombardment of civilian\nneighbourhoods, incursions into villages, town and\ncities and helicopter gunship assaults on civilians have\nbecome daily events for the individual Palestinian\ncitizen on the street. Indeed, those acts have become\nroutine stories in radio and television news.\nWe have silently resigned ourselves to that. It\nseems that the international community has been\nnumbed into accepting that way of life for defenceless\nPalestinians. But unfortunately all Israeli practices\nseem to be emanating from an entrenched precept that\nIsrael is immune to all accountability, exempted from\nall jurisdictions and shielded from all criticism and\ncondemnation by the United Nations or the world's\nmajor Powers.\nAgainst that background, Kuwait reaffirms its\ncommitment to the pan-Arab position adopted at the\nrecent Beirut Arab Summit, which endorsed the\ninitiative put forward by His Royal Highness Prince\nAbdullah Bin Abdel Aziz, Crown Prince of Saudi\nArabia and Chief of the Saudi National Guard. Kuwait\nremains committed to supporting the right of the\nPalestinian people to self-determination and to the\nestablishment of their independent State on their\nnational territory with Jerusalem as their capital.\nKuwait will continue to demand full Israeli withdrawal\nfrom all occupied Arab territories, including the Syrian\nGolan and Lebanese territory.\nWorld history and experience have amply\ndemonstrated that force alone, regardless of the degree\nof brutality, will not bring about peace and security.\nThe only viable option is restoring legitimate rights to\ntheir rightful owners and implementing peace. Perhaps\nthe best assurance for a secure future requires long-\nterm good-will investments in the present.\nKuwait welcomed with satisfaction the decision\nadopted by the most recent Arab summit, held in\nLebanon in March 2002, on the situation between Iraq\n13\n\nand Kuwait. In that decision, the Arab leaders\nwelcomed Iraq's pledges to respect the independence,\nsovereignty, security and territorial integrity of the\nState of Kuwait and to avert any action that might lead\nto the recurrence of the events of 1990. Arab leaders\nalso demanded that Iraq cooperate in finding an\nexpeditious and final solution to the question of\nKuwaiti prisoners and hostages and the return of stolen\nKuwaiti property as set forth in relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions. But, to our deep regret, that\ndecision has not been implemented. The Government\nof Iraq has not as yet carried out its pledges, especially\nin regard to Kuwaiti and third-country prisoners and\ndetainees.\nThat long-running humanitarian question can bear\nno further delay in view of its traumatic implications\nfor the families of the victims, who do not know the\nfate of their loved ones. The Iraqi Government\ncontinues to refuse to cooperate with the United\nNations mechanisms established to deal with the\nmatter. Assessing the approach followed by the Iraqi\nGovernment, the Secretary-General concluded in the\nfinal paragraph of his most recent report to the Security\nCouncil pursuant to paragraph 14 of Council resolution\n1284 (1999), contained in document S/2002/931 of 15\nAugust 2002, that\nDespite the encouraging agreements at the\nArab Summit in Beirut, Iraq's words on the fate\nof the missing persons are yet to be matched by\ntangible deeds. There still is a window of\nopportunity to address humanitarian issues, such\nas that of missing persons, in good faith. Iraq\nshould use this opportunity to restore its\ncredibility on the outstanding humanitarian\nissues.' (para. 40)\nIn that context, Kuwait welcomes the efforts and\nsteps undertaken by the United Nations in preparation\nfor the return of Kuwait's State archives from Iraq\npursuant to relevant Security Council resolutions.\nDespite the fact that Iraq has denied over the past 11\nyears that it had seized the archives, we consider its\nacknowledgement that it holds the archives and its\nintention to return them to be an important step\ntowards carrying out Security Council resolutions,\nparticularly resolutions 686 (1991), 687 (1991) and\n1284 (1999). Irrespective of Iraq's motives for\nreturning the archives and other Kuwaiti State\ndocuments, it is our hope that this step will be followed\nby other positive actions leading to the release of our\nprisoners and those of third countries. Only then can\nthis dossier be closed. I wish to stress here that the\nhumanitarian issue of our prisoners has dominated the\nnational agenda of the Government and the people of\nKuwait since liberation.\nRegarding other relevant issues, Kuwait has\nwelcomed the dialogue between the United Nations and\nIraq, and we hope that this exercise will lead to the\nimplementation of the rest of the key obligations,\nincluding the elimination of weapons of mass\ndestruction and other outstanding matters.\nKuwait thinks that Iraq's strict and scrupulous\nimplementation of all relevant Security Council\nresolutions and the admission of United Nations\nweapons inspectors back into Iraq would spare our\nregion the horrors of a war which we do not want. Such\na war would only lead to the exacerbation of the\nsuffering of the brotherly people of Iraq and to the\nescalation of tension and instability in the region.\nKuwait also welcomes the prudent approach\noutlined by President George Bush of the United States\nin his statement before the General Assembly\nyesterday, in which he requested the Security Council\nto fulfil its legal and political responsibilities within\nthe context of relevant Council resolutions regarding\nIraq. The Security Council undoubtedly has the power\nto do so. We call upon the Security Council to perform\nthat legitimate role. Meanwhile, we demand that Iraq\nfully and strictly implement all relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions in the interest of security and\nstability in the region and in order to avert the dangers\nit faces.\nBecause of its keen interest in maintaining and\nbolstering security and stability in our region, the State\nof Kuwait emphasizes again its support for all efforts\nto resolve by peaceful means the disagreement between\nthe United Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of\nIran over the disputed islands. In that context, we\nwelcome the mutual visits by ranking officials of both\ncountries. We hope that such visits and direct contacts\nwill help the parties to create a favourable climate for\nconfidence-building between the two countries.\nThe world economic landscape has been quite\nturbulent over the past year. Reports issued by\nnumerous specialized international institutions show\nthat many countries, including some developed\ncountries, have begun to suffer from a global economic\nslowdown. That in turn has led to mounting economic\n14\n\nand social burdens on many States due to growing\nimbalances and disparities between the economies of\ncountries of the North and those of the South. While\nthe countries of the North continue to enjoy economic\nprosperity and better standards of living for their\npeoples, countries of the South continue to suffer from\npoverty, famine, unemployment, environmental\ndegradation, severe shortages of drinking water and\nwidespread pandemics such as those of HIV/AIDS and\nmalaria, in addition to a whole range of other problems\nthat impede their efforts towards sustainable\ndevelopment. It is our hope that the decisions and plans\nof action recently adopted at the Johannesburg World\nSummit on Sustainable Development, held at\nJohannesburg in August and September, and at the\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, held in Mexico in February, will help\nbolster efforts and strengthen bonds of cooperation\nbetween the North and the South with a view to laying\nthe underpinnings of a new partnership that contributes\nto the stabilization and growth of economic relations\nand to establishing the basis for an equitable world\ntrade system that sets out the responsibilities and\nobligations of all sides.\nPerhaps one of the most pressing demands at\npresent to shore up the economic structures of the\ndeveloping countries is that the developed nations fulfil\ntheir obligation to provide meaningful financial and\ntechnical aid to the developing world. That includes\nbilateral arrangements and understandings with\ninternational financial institutions and organizations to\nalleviate the debt burden of developing countries and\nthe cancellation of the debts of the poorest nations.\nAlso, any tariffs or other obstacles to access for the\nproducts of those countries to developed countries'\nmarkets should be removed. Furthermore, developing\ncountries should have easier access to information and\ntechnologies that would help them solve their problems\nand became integrated into the world economy. Such\nsteps would prevent the marginalization of the\ndeveloping countries and least developed countries and\nwould help put them back on the road to development.\nIn this regard, Kuwait draws satisfaction from the\nfact that it tops the list of Arab States on the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) Arab\nhuman development index for the current year. The\nArab Human Development Report was published by\nthe UNDP in cooperation with the Arab Fund for\nEconomic and Social Development. The report drew on\na whole range of indices including health, education,\nacquisition of technical knowledge and per capita\nincome. The Government of Kuwait will be guided by\nthe report's indicators and, in cooperation with our\nNational Assembly, which is the legislative authority in\nour country, will maintain its efforts to improve\neconomic and social conditions to the benefit of\nKuwaiti citizens and their well-being.\nI wish to place on record our sense of pride in\ncarrying out all our international obligations. In\nparticular, Kuwait is a robust contributor to the\ndevelopment programmes of many developing nations.\nFurthermore, we are a vibrant player in ensuring a\nstable and balanced global oil market with a view to\nensuring equitable and universal economic\ndevelopment. Also, in line with its Arab and Islamic\nheritage and given the imperatives of kinship, Kuwait\nhas never hesitated to reach out to meet its full official\nand unofficial obligations towards the Palestinian\npeople in the Palestinian territories and towards the\npeople of Afghanistan. It is now our hope that the\nAfghan people, following the recent developments in\ntheir country, will be able to live in security and\nstability after their long and deep suffering due to war\nand internal conflict. Let us hope that the country will\nnow channel all its resources into national\nreconstruction in order to make up for those long years\nof conflict and hostilities.\nInasmuch as the peoples of the world differ in\ntheir religion, culture and ethnicity, they are similar in\ntheir aspirations, ambitions and hopes. We all seek to\nlive in freedom, dignity and safety. We all yearn for a\nworld in which peace, security and justice prevail.\nTranslating that vision and hope into reality requires\naccelerating the pace of concerted global action to meet\nthe lofty purposes and principles defined in the Charter\nof the United Nations.\nIn addition, the United Nations Millennium\nSummit Declaration must be translated into a concrete\nreality that satisfies the hopes and aspirations of the\npeoples of the world. We as countries believe that\nultimately we all are accountable to Allah, His name be\npraised and glorified, the Creator of the universe. We\nare also accountable to our peoples in terms of\nfulfilling their legitimate aspirations in a world of\nprevailing security and peace.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI convey warm\ncongratulations to Mr. Jan Kavan on his unanimous\nelection as President of the fifty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I am confident that, given his vast\nexperience and diplomatic skills, he will be able to\nsteer this session to a successful conclusion. In the\nsame vein, our congratulations and sincere appreciation\ngo to his predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, for the\noutstanding manner in which he conducted the work of\nthe fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I wish\nalso to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the\nillustrious son of Africa at the helm of the\nOrganization, Mr. Kofi Annan, who has taken the\nUnited Nations to greater heights.\nWe join other members of our family of nations\nin welcoming the Swiss Confederation as the one\nhundred and ninetieth Member of the United Nations.\nWe are confident that its membership will not only\nformalize that resourceful country's long involvement\nwith the United Nations but contribute greatly to the\nwork of the Organization.\nAfter a long and bitter liberation struggle, the\npeople of East Timor have finally realized their right to\nself-determination and independence. We look forward\nto welcoming the Democratic Republic of East Timor\nas the one hundred and ninety first Member of the\nUnited Nations. Just as the international community\nstood by the people of East Timor in their darkest hour\nof need, the United Nations must now assist them in\ntheir efforts to rebuild their country.\nThe opening of this session of the General\nAssembly coincided with the first anniversary of the 11\nSeptember terrorist attack on the United States of\nAmerica. That horrific attack met with vigorous\ninternational condemnation and led to a concerted\ncampaign by countries throughout the world to eradicate\nterrorism as a global scourge. All around the world,\n19\n\ncountries, including my own, are continuing to take\ndomestic measures to combat international terrorism.\nLast week the general debate in this hall was\novershadowed by an ominous and terrifying cloud \u2014\nthe threat of war in Iraq. Indeed, most of us have been\nfilled with grave concern about that looming danger.\nThat concern has, however, been somewhat eased. The\nfocus now seems to have moved away from the\ntemptation to take unilateral military action towards the\nmultilateralism that is so vital for the maintenance of\nworld peace and security. In this regard, Namibia\nwelcomes the decision by Iraq to cooperate with the\nSecurity Council.\nNamibia is deeply concerned about the constantly\nescalating violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nThe continuous wanton destruction of Palestinian\ntowns, the demolition of homes and institutions and,\nabove all, the unabating loss of life are all\nmanifestations of the tragic plight of the Palestinian\npeople. While rejecting all acts of violence against\ninnocent civilians, we recognize the urgent need for the\ninternational community to address the root cause of\nviolence, namely, the continued occupation of\nPalestinian territory by Israeli troops.\nIt is imperative for the international community\nto act decisively and with a renewed sense of urgency\nto stop the ongoing carnage and destruction in the\nMiddle East. We support the immediate establishment\nof an independent Palestinian State, existing side by\nside with Israel in peace and mutual security.\nOne of the factors which have militated against\ndevelopment and progress in Africa has been the armed\nconflicts in a number of countries on that continent.\nSuch conflicts have been responsible for the\naggravation of poverty and the spread of disease.\nIt is pleasing to note, however, that peace and\nsecurity in Africa have been increasing over the past\nyear or so. Developments in Angola since February this\nyear have filled us with hope and a sense of relief.\nAfter more than two decades of destructive war,\nAngola is firmly and irreversibly on the road to peace.\nConcerted efforts by the international community are,\nhowever, required to address the urgent and burning\nhumanitarian needs and to help Angola to maintain and\nconsolidate its hard-won peace.\nThere have been similar positive developments in\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo. The ceasefire\nthere has been holding. However, the aggressor\ncountries have still not withdrawn their troops from\nthat country in line with the Lusaka Ceasefire\nAgreement, the Pretoria Agreement and the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions.\nThe United Nations has confirmed, through\nvarious reports, that there continue to be large-scale\nviolations of human rights in the eastern part of that\ncountry. This is unacceptable and should not be\nallowed to continue with impunity. Similarly, the\nplundering of the natural resources of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo should no longer be condoned.\nFurthermore, in Sierra Leone the machine guns,\nwith their staccato sound, have fallen silent, thanks to\nthe intervention of the international community in the\nconflict in that country. Successful elections were held\nthere this year, and the people of that country are now\nbusy with peace-building and the reconstruction of\ntheir country. We call on the international community\nto assist them in this regard.\nIn 1992, the General Assembly decided in favour\nof a referendum in Western Sahara. Ten years later, the\npeople of Western Sahara continue to endure suffering,\nwaiting and hoping for the implementation of the\nUnited Nations plan for the independence of their\ncountry. The only hope they have is our Organization.\nWe, the Members of the United Nations, therefore have\na responsibility towards the people of Western Sahara\nin their quest for self-determination. It is not a question\nof our doing them a favour. Rather, we have an\nobligation under the Charter of our Organization.\nIt is high time that the people of Western Sahara\nexercise their right to self-determination and\nindependence through a free and fair referendum under\nthe supervision of the United Nations. The Secretary-\nGeneral should therefore continue to seek the\nimplementation of the United Nations independence\nplan for Western Sahara.\nThe unilateral economic blockade against Cuba is\ncontinuing to cause immense suffering to the people of\nCuba, who suffered with us and shared with us\nselflessly, extending solidarity to our people during our\ndifficult struggle for independence. We reiterate our\ncall for the lifting of this embargo.\nJust as the people of Africa have begun, in\nearnest, to address the problem of armed conflict that\nhas hindered Africa's development and socio-economic\n20\n\nprogress in the past, the continent must now grapple\nwith yet another menace that is ravaging its population,\nnamely, the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Its devastating\nimpact is now undermining economic growth and\ndevelopment in sub-Saharan Africa, with millions\nalready infected and dying. Indeed, sub-Saharan Africa\nis now facing a human crisis of monumental\nproportions. Millions of AIDS orphans are screaming\nout for help as a result of this rampaging disease.\nWe appeal for increased and generous\ncontributions to the Global Health Fund to enable us to\nfight the scourge. In that connection, we would like to\nemphasize that the allocation of the available funds\nshould be determined by the magnitude of the problem\nin each country.\nAs part of our ongoing effort to fight the scourge\nof HIV/AIDS, Namibia will be hosting the Second\nRegional Conference on Orphans and Vulnerable\nChildren from 25 to 29 November, 2002. It is our\nsincere hope that the Conference will further highlight\nthe fate of those children and galvanize the world's\nfurther support to ease their truly difficult plight. We\nare quite confident that the support of the international\ncommunity will enable us, indeed, humanity, and\nAfrica in particular, to conquer this ravaging pandemic.\nThe drought situation in Southern Africa places\nmore than 12 million people at risk of hunger and\ndestitution. We welcome the efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral in that respect. We also welcome the efforts of\nthe donor community in mobilizing resources for relief.\nOur sincere thanks and appreciation also go to all the\nhumanitarian agencies providing support. We\nencourage them to continue to mobilize and to render\nfurther support.\nThe fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly\nhas special significance for Africa, in the sense that\nconsiderable attention is being paid to the continent's\nproblems. In the first instance, there is the tabling by the\nSecretary-General of the report on the final review and\nappraisal of the implementation of the United Nations\nNew Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s.\nThis session also marks the end of the United Nations\nProgramme for the Second Industrial Development\nDecade for Africa. The conclusions of the review are\nsobering in the sense that both the New Agenda for the\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s and the\nProgramme for the Second Industrial Development\nDecade for Africa have come to an end, but Africa\nremains marginalized in the global economy.\nAlso significant for Africa at this session is the\nfact that notwithstanding the continent's rather minimal\ndevelopment performance during the periods just\nreferred to, Africa has come to the fifty-seventh session\nof the General Assembly more determined then ever to\nlaunch itself on a new path of economic growth and\ndevelopment.\nIt was in the light of this determination that on\nMonday, 16 September 2002 the General Assembly\ndevoted the whole day to exploring ways in which the\ninternational community can support the African\nUnion's New Partnership for Africa's Development\n(NEPAD), designed to rebuild and rejuvenate our\ncontinent. What emerged from the Monday meeting on\nAfrica was a clear sense of purpose and direction such\nthat, while hoping for greater support from the\ninternational community to implement its new\ndevelopment initiative, Africa is seriously seeking to\nlift itself up by its own bootstraps.\nIndeed, the African leaders have reaffirmed their\ncommitment to the development goals of the United\nNations Millennium Summit Declaration for the\ncontinent to achieve economic growth of 7 per cent by\nthe year 2015 and thus to be able to halve poverty on\nthe continent by that same year.\nAnd while NEPAD is an African initiative, owned\nand managed by the African Union, the continent still\nneeds unfettered market access for its goods, increased\nforeign investment, the elimination of external debts\nand, yes, more Official Development Assistance, as\nwell as a large infusion of technology and skills into its\nproduction processes.\nIn conclusion, I would like to state Namibia's\nposition on the International Criminal Court (ICC). A\nfew individuals who commit heinous crimes against\nhumanity undermine international peace and security.\nWhen those who commit serious crimes go unpunished,\nmurder and torture carry no risk. Rather, they\nencourage even more crimes. The entry into force of\nthe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court\non 1 July 2002 represents a historic day for\ninternational justice.\nAs a State Party to the ICC, Namibia has noted\nwith great concern the adoption of Security Council\nresolution 1422 (2002) under chapter VII of the United\n21\n\nNations Charter, as if the ICC were a threat to peace or an\nact of aggression. In this context, we call upon those\nStates that are not Parties to the Statute to become so now.\nIn the face of a growing tendency towards\nunilateralism, the revitalization of the General\nAssembly, which is the collective decision-making\nbody, is becoming even more important. In the same\nvein, Namibia reaffirms its position on the need to\nreform and democratize the United Nations Security\nCouncil in order to ensure that the Council remains\nresponsible for the peace and security of all countries\nin all regions.\nFrom this very rostrum, it has been said time and\nagain that if the United Nations did not exist, it would\nhave to be created. Those are not empty words. Rather,\nthey express the deep aspirations and commitment of\nhumanity to the Organization, which has stood the test\nof time and proven indispensable to the conduct of\nrelations among States. Let us not allow\nmultilateralism to be eroded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI\nwould like at the outset to congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan\non his election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-seventh session and to assure him\nof the full support and cooperation of the delegation of\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran as he embarks on his\ncrucial task. I would also like to express my\nappreciation to the President of Assembly at its fifty-\n19\n\nsixth session for his skilful leadership. I would also\nlike to welcome Switzerland to the United Nations, and\nlook forward also to welcoming the Democratic\nRepublic of Timor-Leste.\nI would like to pay tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral for his strong and compassionate leadership\nand for the vision and wisdom that he expressed in his\nstatement before the Assembly.\nThe world today is characterized by great\ndiversity and emerging factors with a far-reaching\ninfluence. In the light of advances in information\ntechnology and of the new international information\norder, current issues and problems are interrelated, like\nthe parts of an organism, and truly global. More than\never before, we see that nations and States are seeking\nto expand their options and ascertain the nature and the\nextent of their contribution to, and participation in,\nglobal affairs on the basis of not only their national\nsecurity and interests but also their regional\nresponsibilities, as well as international requirements\nand norms. This trend towards the achievement of such\nfundamental objectives points to the expansion of a\nglobal, democratic and participatory process that will\nendure in the long term and is thus sustainable.\nEmbracing diversity, questioning and critically\nreviewing the past and seeking democratic\nparticipation and action all teach us that the\nfundamental universal human values of peace and\nsecurity, freedom and independence, and justice and\nfairness must become the very centre of global\nattention. Without continued, active cooperation to\ndraw our world closer to such fundamental values, we\nwill not successfully meet the current global\nchallenges. Without expanding the scope of peace and\nsecurity, neither freedom nor independence will be\nachievable; without justice and fairness, neither peace\nnor security will become accessible; and without\nfreedom and independence, both peace and security\nwill become impossible to attain. It is only through\nsuch an approach that we will be able to work together,\nthink together and cooperate in a multilateral\nframework so as to find answers to challenges we face\nin common and to deal with regional crises.\nThe world is facing grave challenges today,\nparticularly in the aftermath of the tragic terror attacks\nof 11 September 2001. Chief among these challenges\nare terrorism and other forms of violence. Combating\nthe sinister phenomenon of terrorism is an urgent and\nunavoidable imperative. A genuine and effective fight\nagainst terrorism must include, on the one hand, an\nattempt to identify the root causes of terrorism and, on\nthe other, a concerted effort by the international\ncommunity to address them. It goes without saying that\nthe perpetrators of acts of terrorism must be brought to\njustice and given their just deserts. Calling for the root\ncauses of terrorism to be addressed should in no way\nbe construed as an attempt to justify terrorism or\ndetract from the gravity of terrorist acts or from the\nseverity of the punishments that terrorists deserve. It is\nintended to pinpoint an effective and comprehensive\nmeans of eliminating terrorism.\nIn this context, it appears that exploring problems\nsuch as the worldwide increase in injustice and\ndiscrimination, the marginalization of a large number\nof people and occupation and the violation of the\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of others,\nextremism, fanaticism, bigotry, poverty and\nunderdevelopment could prove helpful in identifying\nthe root causes of terrorism.\nIn our opinion, a wise and principled approach to\nfighting terrorism would entail full international\ncooperation, expressed at the highest political level in a\nworld summit that would seek, inter alia, to develop an\ninclusive definition of terrorism that is generally\nacceptable.\nIn a letter addressed to the Secretary-General\nimmediately after the disastrous attacks of 11\nSeptember, President Khatami called for such a world\nsummit to address this crucial issue and to encourage\ninternational cooperation to fight terrorism under the\nauspices of the United Nations.\nThere should be a worldwide campaign against\nall forms and manifestations of terrorism and their\nperpetrators, irrespective of the identity of the victims\nor the objectives. Distinction must also be made\nbetween acts of terrorism and the legitimate struggle of\npeoples under foreign occupation or aggression, in\naccordance with international law. Any campaign bent\non relating the inhuman phenomenon of terrorism to\ndivine religions that have always been the harbingers\nof peace, love, amity and moral decency is a great and\nunforgivable transgression against those religions and\ntheir countless followers.\nAs a victim of the most brutal acts of terrorism,\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran regards fighting terrorism\nin a genuine and comprehensive way as a top national\n20\n\npriority, and it is thus in the forefront of the\ninternational coalition against terrorism. To help\npromote regional and international peace and security,\nmy country has thus far signed bilateral agreements or\nis in the process of finalizing such agreements with\nmore than 20 countries on the extradition of offenders\nand on the provision of legal assistance for promoting\ncooperation in the areas of fighting terrorism, drug\ntrafficking and other organized crimes, of the\nextradition of criminals and of mutual legal assistance.\nWe are intent on further strengthening this policy of\nenhanced cooperation. In that context, and in\naccordance with Security Council resolutions 1373\n(2001) and 1390 (2002), the Islamic Republic of Iran\nhas reported to the Security Council Counter-Terrorism\nCommittee regarding its counter-terrorism efforts in\ngeneral and about the measures it has adopted against\nthe Taliban and Al Qaeda in particular.\nWe are greatly concerned by the current trend of\ninternational disarmament negotiations, which is\nleading to the further vulnerability and fragility of\ninternational security. Rejection of the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) by a permanent\nmember of the Security Council and the holder of the\nlargest nuclear arsenal, and the withdrawal of that\nmember from negotiations on the CTBT on-site\ninspection operational manual, point to that State's\npolicy of unilateralism. Further signs of such a policy\nare its withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile\nTreaty, its blocking of the negotiations on a protocol\nstrengthening the implementation of the Biological\nWeapons Convention and its going against the\njudgement of the international community with respect\nto the regulation of the trade and transfer of small arms\nand light weapons.\nIt is only by developing a broader view of\nmultilateralism, international cooperation and respect\nfor the rule of law that we can guarantee progress and\nsuccess in the field of disarmament and international\nsecurity issues. Expansion of and deeper respect for\nhuman rights throughout the world are a function of\ntheir universality and indivisibility, on the one hand,\nand of the recognition of national and regional\nparticularities and cultural backgrounds, on the other.\nRejecting the use of human rights for\npolitical purposes, rejecting double standards and\ndiscriminatory approaches, and promoting international\ncooperation in that field for the sake of human rights\nwill definitely help promote respect for human rights\nand fundamental freedoms. Such an approach prevailed\nat the fifty-eighth session of the Commission on\nHuman Rights, and my country thus received a\nfavourable decision. We are pleased that, with the\ncooperation of other States, our draft resolutions on\ndeveloping international cooperation in the field of\nhuman rights and on promoting cultural diversity were\nadopted.\nGlobalization will yield fruitful results when\nit is accompanied by a non-selective and non-\ndiscriminatory approach: when it provides equal\nopportunities for all within the framework of a global\npartnership. If the developed countries fail to fulfil\ntheir responsibilities, globalization can hardly be called\na success story. An open, equitable, law-based,\ntransparent and non-discriminatory international\ntrading system is a prerequisite for achieving the goals\nof economic growth and sustainable development in\ndeveloping countries.\nThe continued brutalities in occupied Palestine\nonce again indicate that solutions not well grounded in\njustice and realism will fail to bring about lasting peace\nin the Middle East region. The Palestinian people have\nthe right, under international law, the Charter of the\nUnited Nations and the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights, to persist in their struggle to restore\ntheir inalienable rights. Occupying other people's land\nmust be condemned, as must labelling as terrorist a\nnation that is only fighting to liberate its homeland.\nThe way to achieve a lasting peace in the Middle\nEast is to guarantee to Palestinians the right to return to\ntheir homeland and the right to self-determination,\nleading to the formation \u2014 in a democratic process and\nunder the supervision of the United Nations \u2014 of a\nPalestinian State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.\nIt is the Palestinian people's legitimate right to choose,\nthrough democratic means, their future political system\nand the manner in which they elect to establish their\ncivil and political order. We respect the choices that the\nPalestinian people make.\nThe long-standing policy of the Islamic Republic\nof Iran towards Afghanistan has been the rejection of\nviolence, the promotion of intra-Afghan dialogue and\nthe establishment of a representative Government by\ndemocratic means. We are pleased that, as a result of\ninternational efforts \u2014 particularly by the United\nNations \u2014 civil order is gradually being consolidated\nby the Afghan people themselves through the\n21\n\nestablishment of the Interim Administration, the\nEmergency Loya Jirga and the Transitional\nGovernment. Formulating Afghanistan's Constitution\non the basis of democratic principles, Afghan culture\nand tradition, taking into account the views of all\nethnic groups, will be a major step in consolidating law\nand order, in strengthening the political structure and in\nachieving peace, security and stability in Afghanistan.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is continuing its\nclose cooperation with the Transitional Government of\nAfghanistan, especially in the context of spending the\n$50 million in assistance earmarked for small-scale\nreconstruction projects in Afghanistan during the\nIranian fiscal year 1381, which began on 21 March\n2002. Joint efforts that are moving forward include\nproviding custom facilities and preferential\narrangements in customs, transit, trade and scientific,\ncultural and educational cooperation; combating drug\ntrafficking and terrorism; and helping Afghan refugees\nto return to Afghanistan. The international community\nis expected to make good on its pledges to Afghanistan\nso as to begin to rebuild the economic infrastructure\nthere and to create conditions conducive to the\nvoluntary return of Afghan refugees to their homeland.\nGreater attention and resources must be invested \u2014\nparticularly by the United Nations International\nDrug Control Programme \u2014 in crop substitution\nprogrammes in Afghanistan as an effective strategy to\nfight narcotics trafficking.\nRespect for the sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity of Iraq and compliance by Iraq with relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions \u2014 particularly those\nconcerning the return of the weapons inspectors to\nIraq \u2014 followed by the lifting of international\nsanctions in the interest of the oppressed people of\nIraq, constitute the overall policy of the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran towards Iraq. We oppose any\nunilateral measures or military intervention in Iraq, we\nunderline the central role of the United Nations in that\nregard, and we hold that it is up to the people of Iraq to\ndetermine their own future through democratic means.\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is following the\nsituation between its two neighbours, Pakistan and\nIndia, with much concern. As a neighbour, we wish to\nstress the age-old wisdom of the subcontinent and to\nimpress upon the leadership in both countries the\nimportance of exercising self-restraint in both word\nand deed and of keeping open the lines of\ncommunication and dialogue with a view to resolving\nthe situation in accordance with the rules and principles\nof international law and in the interests of both nations.\nThe current global trend towards participation in\ncollective efforts to face major international challenges\nand resolve regional crises through democratic means\nhas raised a glimmer of hope for our world today. No\ndoubt, dialogue among civilizations has a special place\nin charting the way and promoting understanding and\ntolerance in these troubled times. Dialogue, as a\nmultifaceted and long-term process, teaches us to grow\nout of the politics of domination that have created so\nmuch agony and violence and gradually to opt for the\npolitics of interaction, tolerance and communication. In\nthis context, the United Nations, as a centre of\ndialogue, international decision-making and\nimplementation, will increasingly gain in importance as\nthe international community resolves to strengthen\ninternational peace, security and development.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy\ndelegation is particularly pleased to convey to Mr. Jan\nKavan its heartfelt congratulations and fervent hopes\nfor success in the lofty and important task ahead of\nhim. His well-deserved election to the presidency of\nthe fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly is a\nfitting tribute to the spirit of the Czech people as well\nas to his outstanding intellectual and moral qualities.\nI am pleased to take this opportunity to say how\nmuch we appreciated the courtesy, the commitment and\nthe competence of his predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo,\nwho guided our discussions in such an outstanding\nmanner. We express to him our sincere and deep\ngratitude for his many relevant initiatives, including\nworking visits to West Africa, particularly to Senegal,\nwhich are testimony of friendship for my country and\nsupport for the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment (NEPAD).\nI should like also like to express once again to\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan our admiration for his\nsteadfast determination in serving the ideals and causes\nof our Organization. Thanks to his wisdom and far-\nsightedness, the United Nations has found new vigour\nwith which to meet the tremendous challenges\nconfronting humankind.\nIt is therefore fitting that our Organization \nwhich more than ever needs the widest support for its\nplans and projects for a better management of the\naffairs of our globalized world  is gaining two new\nMembers: Switzerland and, soon, East Timor. To the\ndelegations of those two friendly countries, I would\nlike to express Senegal's warmest congratulations and\nour conviction that their contribution will undoubtedly\nbe enriching for our Organization, whose universal\ncharacter will thereby be reinforced.\nIt is precisely in the name of the principle of the\nuniversality of the United Nations that Senegal\nreiterates its fervent wish to see the Republic of China\non Taiwan join the concert of nations and assume its\nfull responsibilities in our Organization and its\nspecialized agencies. Granting that request, following\nthe good precedent of the World Trade Organization,\nwould bring justice to the 23 million inhabitants of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan, who through their\nexemplary conduct on the world stage have already\ngiven proof of Taipei's attachment to the noble\nobjectives of the San Francisco Charter.\nLast week, the United Nations and the\ninternational community commemorated the\nanniversary of the tragic events of 11 September 2001.\nWe express once again our sincere sentiments of\nsympathy and compassion to the thousands of\nAmerican and other families in mourning. Senegal, its\nhead of State and its Government strongly reiterate\ntheir steadfast determination to fight against terrorism\nin all its forms and manifestations, whatever its\nmotivations and whoever its perpetrators and sponsors.\nSenegal proclaims loudly and clearly that there is no\nreason or cause sufficiently just or sufficiently good\nthat it could justify an act of terrorism against pregnant\nwomen and other innocent civilians.\n23\n\nThe Dakar Declaration against Terrorism, adopted\non 17 October 2001 at the initiative of President\nAbdoulaye Wade of Senegal, gives full expression to\nour fervent wish to strengthen regional and subregional\ncooperation in order to dismantle the menace of\nterrorist activities on our continent. Let us remember\nthe heinous and unrepentant terrorist strikes against the\nAfrican people in Kenya and Tanzania. Nor do we\nforget the heroic daily resistance of the Algerian people\nin the face of repeated assaults by killers blinded by\ntheir hatred and not by their faith in God, at least not in\nthe God of love and compassion that we Muslims\nproudly call Allah.\nTo that end, Senegal submitted some months ago\nto the African Union a draft additional protocol to the\nConvention on the Prevention and Combating of\nTerrorism of the Organization of African Unity and the\nAfrican Union. The draft protocol aims to strengthen\nthe Algiers Convention and to adapt it to the post-11-\nSeptember context. Also, my delegation welcomes the\nfine initiative of the Commission of the African Union,\nwhich recently held in Algiers a high-level\nintergovernmental meeting on terrorism in Africa. In\nother words, we have the common responsibility to\nmaintain and to strengthen the international\nmobilization against terrorist networks and their\nfinancing.\nMy Government welcomes the excellent work\nalready carried out by the Security Council Counter-\nTerrorism Committee pursuant to Security Council\nresolution 1373 (2001). Senegal encourages the\nCommittee to pursue its efforts and requests the\nWorking Group of the General Assembly's Sixth\nCommittee to do everything to hasten the adoption of a\ncomprehensive international convention against\nterrorism.\nIt is a truism that the fight against terrorism is a\npart of the international community's struggle to\npromote international peace and security. That is the\nobjective that over the past months has not escaped our\nOrganization, which has strived to find lasting\nsolutions to conflicts that destroy the social and\neconomic fabric of numerous countries, especially in\nAfrica.\nIn that regard, Senegal keenly appreciates the\ndetermined commitment of the Security Council,\nwhich, more conscious than ever of its role of\nguarantor of international peace and security, has\ndevoted a large portion of its work this year to conflicts\nand tensions afflicting the African continent. Among\nthe numerous praiseworthy initiatives of the Security\nCouncil, I would like to mention the convening of\nspecial meetings devoted to the situation of Africa,\nbrilliantly presided over by the Ministers for Foreign\nAffairs of Mauritius and Singapore during their\nrespective presidencies.\nOn behalf of the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS), of which Senegal currently\nholds the chairmanship, I would like to nurture the\nhope that the United Nations will stay the course in\norder to forever stave off violence and wars, which\ntake a serious financial toll on the future of many\nAfrican countries. I am thinking of Sierra Leone, where\nthe current exemplary normalization of the political\nand economic situation has largely been facilitated by\nthe holding of free, transparent, democratic and\npeaceful elections.\nIt is urgent that the bells of peace, which have\nsounded in Freetown, also be heard in Monrovia, where\nthe absence of political dialogue led the way to grave\nsocio-economic instability, whose contagious effect\ncould turn out to be disastrous for the Mano River\nUnion area. Senegal, as Chairman of ECOWAS, is\nworking tirelessly and hopes to be able to report to the\nAssembly on its many initiatives under way, which\ncould very shortly lay the foundations of peace in\nLiberia.\nIn Sierra Leone and Liberia, as in Guinea-Bissau,\nwhere the Government of President Kumba Yal\u00b7 is\nattempting with courage and abnegation to lift the\ncountry out of a financial and economic crisis\nfollowing a trying civil war, the international\ncommunity has the duty to continue more steadfastly\nits valuable assistance. In that regard, I welcome the\nstrong signal sent by the Security Council under the\nUnited States presidency to financial backers with\nrespect to granting Guinea-Bissau substantial financial\naid so that it can firmly return to the path of peace and\nprosperity.\nThe interest in that neighbour of Senegal and in\nour subregion recalls the wise and timely decision to\nestablish at Dakar an Office of the Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for West\nAfrica. That Office should promote better coordination\namong the activities of the United Nations in our\nsubregion and their greater impact on the ground. I am\n24\n\npleased to sincerely congratulate Secretary-General\nKofi Annan on that clear-sighted initiative. It goes\nwithout saying that the Office will enjoy the\nenthusiastic support and complete cooperation of the\nGovernment of Senegal.\nAllow me to recall the activities of President\nAbdoulaye Wade in benefit of the great African people\nof Madagascar. His personal and total involvement in\nmediating a solution to the Madagascar crisis has, as a\ngreat international statesman said, surely spared the\npeople of that great island a drift towards a civil war of\nincalculable consequences. He and his African\ncolleagues who have taken up that issue have shown\nthe world that with the strong support of the\ninternational community Africans will prove that they\nare also and above all peacemakers.\nElsewhere, beyond the African continent but so\nclose to our hearts, we observe a growing danger in the\nMiddle East. This year again, the world has witnessed\nunheard-of violence in the Palestinian territories, where\nthe occupying military Power, Israel, has decidedly\nopted for State violence, which leads to concepts as\ndangerous as the so-called targeted assassinations and\nother preventive operations.\nOn the Palestinian side, that situation has caused\nan increase in terrorist cells  specialists in suicide\nbelts  groups that we unequivocally and resolutely\ncondemn. That network has produced an erosion of\ntrust between Israelis and Palestinians  trust that\nmust be restored as swiftly as possible through frank\nand constructive dialogue that leads to a just and\nlasting solution.\nIn order to achieve that, it is imperative that Tel\nAviv comply with the relevant Security Council\nresolutions  in particular resolutions 242 (1967), 338\n(1973) and 1397 (2002)  and that it also adhere to the\npeace plan proposed by Saudi Arabia and to the\ninitiatives of the Quartet, which set out the basic\nprinciples of land for peace and withdrawal for\nnormalization. The international community, in\nparticular the Security Council and the Quartet, has the\ncritical duty to formulate a bold plan to realize the\nvision of two States within the 1967 borders and to\nhasten what Senegal has continued to call for in all\ninternational forums: the immediate convening of an\ninternational conference on Palestine, leading to a\nspecific mechanism that would address political,\neconomic and security issues and having as its starting\npoint the creation of a sovereign Palestinian State side\nby side an Israeli State, living in peace and harmony\nwith its neighbours.\nOver the past 12 months, the international scene\nhas been dominated by the holding of three major\nconferences that were crucial events in humanity's\ncollective march towards a more just and more unified\nworld: the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the World\nTrade Organization, held at Doha, Qatar; the\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, held at Monterrey, Mexico; and the\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development, held at\nJohannesburg, South Africa. Those world conferences\nand the strong alliances that they created will allow\nhumanity to enter the third millennium on a positive\nnote.\nI should like to note here that, in the light of\nthose statements of good intentions, the time for action\nhas come. We must act swiftly so that globalization, a\nphenomenon that affects us all, will ultimately benefit\nus all. Up to now, despite its certain virtues,\nglobalization seems to have caused greater\nmarginalization of the vast majority of the peoples of\nthe South. As a consequence, it is urgent that we\nidentify innovative mechanisms of development\nfinancing. In fact, even if official development\nassistance is still valuable for the States of the South,\nits effectiveness will be limited without the addition of\nconcrete measures such as access for products of the\nSouth to markets of the North, an increase in foreign\ndirect investment flows to developing countries,\nparticularly those in Africa, and the initiating role that,\nwe must recognize, belongs to the international and\nAfrican private sectors. Indeed, Senegal is convinced\nthat no country in the world has ever developed\nthrough official development assistance. The private\nsector, infrastructure and education are universally\nacknowledged as the tripod of genuine sustainable\ndevelopment. It is no less urgent, following the much-\nappreciated appointment of a High Representative of\nthe Secretary-General for the Least Developed\nCountries, that we all commit ourselves to\nimplementing the Brussels Programme of Action, in\nconformity with the consensus of the 12th Ministerial\nMeeting of the Group of 49, held at Cotonou from 5 to\n7 August 2002.\nThe success of such initiatives cannot depend on\nGovernments alone. We need to build firm partnerships\nwith local communities, with civil society actors, with\n25\n\nthe private sector, with non-governmental\norganizations and with international organizations. It is\nfitting that humanity's oldest continent should be proud\nof the adoption of the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment (NEPAD), a double partnership \ninternal and international  and a linkage, on the one\nhand, among Africans and, on the other, between\nAfrica and the rest of the international community,\nwhich has already shown its full support for that new\ninitiative. As evidence, I cite the Group of Eight Africa\nAction Plan and the holding of the high-level plenary\nmeeting of the General Assembly to consider how to\nsupport NEPAD.\nThrough NEPAD, which has the merit of defining\nthe prerequisites for African development, of\nidentifying sectoral priorities and of developing a\nresource mobilization strategy, African leaders \namong them His Excellency Mr. Abdoulaye Wade,\nPresident of the Republic of Senegal  intend to\ndemonstrate that the responsibility for Africa's\ndevelopment is essentially theirs. In that context, I\nmust mention the launching of the African Union in\nJuly at Durban, South Africa. We hope that its Peace\nand Security Council, coupled with NEPAD's Peer\nReview Mechanism, will lead to strong commitments\nby our heads of State, first for our people and then for\nour partners, which are very concerned by the central\nquestions of good governance and conflict prevention\nand resolution.\nOur development concerns do not preclude our\ndemands for human rights. That is why my country\nattaches great importance to the promotion and\nprotection of the rights of women and children. At the\ninitiative of the Government, a major programme is\nunder way to combat, in particular, violence against\nwomen and the trafficking and exploitation of women\nand children for commercial and sexual purposes. In\nthose areas, the strategy formulated and implemented\nby Senegal is based on action plans adopted at the\nspecial session of the General Assembly on Beijing +5\nand on the follow-up to the World Summit on Children.\nAs is its custom, Senegal wishes to honour and\npraise the great role of women in the world, in\nparticular their African sisters, as the foundation and\nthe powerful engine of African renewal. History will\ntake note that it is Senegal that, through its President,\nhas demanded and ensured that each of the five\nsubregions of Africa elect at least one woman in its\nquota of two Commissioners to the Commission of the\nAfrican Union. Africa is thus teaching the rest of the\nworld a lesson in unprecedented parity, which is more\nproof  if it were needed  that, if we seek competent\nwomen, we will find them.\nAt the initiative of its President, Senegal will\norganize, on 10 October at Dakar, a special summit of\nheads of State or Government of ECOWAS to follow\nup the results of the twenty-sixth special session of the\nGeneral Assembly, devoted to children.\nThe rights of women and children are integral\nelements of human rights, and my country reaffirms its\nattachment to the principles of the universality,\ninterdependence and indivisibility of human rights, of\ngood economic and political governance and of the rule\nof law. It is that democratic imperative that has\nprompted the head of State of Senegal to strengthen our\ninstitutional arsenal by creating the position of\nCommissioner of Human Rights, to which a woman\nhas been appointed.\nAs members are aware, Senegal was the first\ncountry in the world to ratify the Rome Statute for the\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court\n(ICC), whose entry into force on 1 July 2002 my\ncountry welcomed. That commitment resulted in my\nGovernment's decision to present a candidate for judge\non the ICC  one of our finest magistrates and a\nspecialist in criminal law.\nIn conclusion, I should like, in recalling the\nurgency of confronting humanity's numerous\nchallenges, to express the earnest hope that the\nOrganization will bolster its ability to better serve the\nlegitimate hopes of the world's peoples. Undoubtedly,\nthat path will anchor the future of a world reconciled\nwith itself, where justice, freedom, peace and\nprosperity will be jealously preserved in justice and\nfreedom, in peace and prosperity, and in the dignity of\nhuman beings  all human beings.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe Commonwealth of\nDominica joins other delegations in congratulating you\non your election to chair the proceedings of the fifty-\nseventh session of the United Nations General\nAssembly. We are confident that you will preside over\nthis Assembly with the efficiency and dedication\nrequired to take us through the agenda of the fifty-\nseventh session.\nWe also take this opportunity to extend to your\npredecessor our sincere appreciation for the excellent\nmanner in which he steered the work of the fifty-sixth\nsession of this General Assembly.\nOne year ago we convened in a city reeling from\na terrible tragedy which spurred the international\ncommunity to unite in the fight against international\nterrorism. The world's response to the events of 11\nSeptember 2001 was one of total condemnation of\nterrorism in all its forms and a firm undertaking to\nuphold the principles of freedom and democracy\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe United Nations Security Council was swift\nand decisive in its adoption of a resolution focused on\nsuppressing the financing of terrorism and denying\nterrorists any safe haven in which to operate. Sadly,\nterrorism remains today one of the greatest threats to\nhuman security. The Commonwealth of Dominica\ntherefore once again reaffirms its commitment to the\nfight against international terrorism and to ensuring\nthat the channels for funding of terrorist-related\nactivities and international crime are permanently\ndisabled.\nMy Government is making every effort towards\nthe successful implementation of United Nations\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) in spite of\nlimited human and financial resources. Legislative\nmeasures which have been put in place include an\nExchange of Information Act, which addresses some of\nthe concerns of the international community as\nexpressed in resolution 1373 (2001). This Act was\npassed in the Dominica Parliament in January 2002,\nwhile a bill for the suppression of financing of\nterrorism will be tabled before Parliament shortly.\nMy delegation wishes to take this opportunity to\nexpress its appreciation for the initiatives taken by the\nCounter-Terrorism Committee, the Commonwealth, the\nEuropean Union and other countries and organizations\nto assist developing countries in their implementation\nof resolution 1373 (2001).\nThe historic entry into force of the Rome Statute\nof the International Criminal Court (ICC) takes us one\nstep further in the fight against impunity of war crimes\nand crimes against humanity. The Commonwealth of\nDominica's accession to the Statute of the ICC in\nJanuary 2001 is indicative of our support for the\nestablishment of a permanent international court that\nwill bring the perpetrators of the most serious\ninternational crimes to justice. In this regard, the ICC\nmust seek to prevent or penalize terrorist-related\ncrimes which may be localized in action, but may have\nsevere global consequences.\nThe international situation, notably developments\nin the world economy, has not been favourable to the\ngrowth prospects of small States such as the\nCommonwealth of Dominica, which remains a small,\nopen and largely agriculture-based economy, extremely\nvulnerable to external economic shocks. While the\nevents of 11 September 2001 are behind us, the\nirreparable damage to the economies of small\nCaribbean countries is still evident. Hardest hit was the\ntourism sector, one of the areas with the greatest\npotential to contribute to Dominica's social and\neconomic development.\n32\n\nThe growth of our offshore financial sector,\nanother potential contributor to our economic\ndiversification, has been adversely affected by our\ncountry's inclusion in the list of non-cooperative\ncountries and territories put out by the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD)'s\nFinancial Action Task Force. All attempts thus far to\nhave our country removed from that list have proved\nfutile, in spite of the implementation of the measures\nnecessary to ensure best industry practices in the\nfinancial services sector.\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica nevertheless\ncommits itself to the global combat against money-\nlaundering and stands ready to cooperate with the\ninternational community in its anti-money-laundering\ninitiative. A number of new laws have been enacted by\nParliament to legislate its anti-money-laundering\npolicies. The Commonwealth of Dominica has also\nestablished a Financial Intelligence Unit and a Money-\nLaundering Supervisory Authority to ensure that our\nfinancial-services sector remains free from money-\nlaundering.\nAs I address you, my country is facing one of the\nmost challenging periods in its history. The slowdown\nin the global economy, the impact of the events of 11\nSeptember 2001 on an already deteriorating fiscal\nsituation, the continued difficulties of integrating into\nthe multilateral trading system in a globalized world\nand the rapid decline in overseas development\nassistance have undoubtedly affected our economic\nperformance in an appallingly negative way.\nWe have been left with no other option but to\npursue a stabilization and adjustment programme,\nwhich, although approved by the International\nMonetary Fund, has not succeeded in keeping\ndetractors, including the public service union, off the\nstreets.\nThe success of this programme should lay the\nbasis for sustained higher growth output and\nemployment, as well as poverty reduction. We\nrecognize, however, the attendant costs of\nimplementing this programme. The Dominican people\nhave been asked to make temporary, but heavy\nsacrifices in order to place our country on the road to\nrecovery.\nWe wish to recognize, in this forum, the support\ngiven in these difficult times to the Commonwealth of\nDominica at the Caribbean regional level, and look\nforward to the timely support of the international\ncommunity.\nLast year, as the world turned its attention to the\nevents of 11 September, the Secretary-General\nreminded us that none of the issues that faced us on 10\nSeptember had become less urgent. Indeed, the United\nNations calendar for the past year has been crowded\nwith special conferences and summits, all convened to\naddress problems and issues of global concern that\naffect the everyday lives of the peoples of the United\nNations. While it is true that those issues are current\nand of interest to the smaller members of this body it is\nunfortunate that many of us do not have the capacity or\nwherewithal to ensure that they receive effective\nrepresentation, not only at the conferences but, more\nsignificantly, in the preparatory committees that\nprecede the conferences. It is no accident, therefore,\nthat most often the States that least benefit are the\nsmallest and least influential.\nThe Second World Assembly on Ageing and the\nspecial session on children attempted to deal with\nissues which affect the most vulnerable members of our\nsocieties. The World Assembly concluded in April with\na Plan of Action for implementation by the\ninternational community. In small countries like the\nCommonwealth of Dominica, this implementation\nmust, of necessity, include the recognition of older\npersons as the pillars of our societies \u2014 people who\nmake a significant contribution to our economic\ndevelopment.\nMy Government has developed a national policy\non ageing which seeks to ensure that older persons are\nprovided with protective care and given an opportunity\nto continue to participate in the development of our\nnation. A few weeks ago, we were privileged to host\nthe tenth annual regional meeting of HelpAge\nInternational \u2014 a happy coincidence, given that among\nour population of 75,000, we have 22 centenarians. I\nwant to make specific mention of the world's oldest\nliving person \u2014 a Dominican woman, Mrs. Elizabeth\nIsrael, affectionately known as Ma Pampo \u2014 who is\nallegedly 127.\nCivil society organizations like HelpAge must be\nrecognized for their vigorous attempts to deal with\nissues affecting older persons. As a family of nations,\nwe established set goals, strategies and actions in\npursuit of a better life for children at the special\nsession of the General Assembly on children. As a\n33\n\nsignatory to the Convention on the Rights of the Child,\nthe Commonwealth of Dominica remains committed to\nensuring that children's rights are protected and\nrespected. Children are one of our most valuable\nresources.\nThe Monterrey Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment was convened in March this year, and\nwas hailed as a \u201cturning point in the approach to\ndevelopment cooperation\u201d by the international\ncommunity. It was widely acknowledged at Monterrey\nthat, in order for development assistance to be\neffective, both the donors and the recipients had to\nshare the same goals of sustainable development and\nthe alleviation and eventual eradication of poverty.\nWe applaud the commitment expressed by the\nmajor donor Governments to the Monterrey Consensus.\nWhat we desire, however, is an equitable distribution\nof the increased official development assistance funds\npledged by the heads of State or Government of the\nEuropean Union in March 2002. The same can be said\nof the \u201cnew compact for global development\u201d proposed\nby President George W. Bush on 14 March 2002, by\nwhich the United States pledged to increase its core\nassistance to developing countries by 50 per cent over\nthe next three years.\nWe are still confident that global conferences can\nwork, because it has been proved that they serve as\nforums where new proposals can be debated and\nconsensus sought on topical issues. At the recently\nconcluded Johannesburg Summit, world Governments\nagreed to halve by 2015 the number of people lacking\nclean water and basic sanitation.\nMy Government was particularly pleased that at\nthe conclusion of the Johannesburg Summit the richer\ncountries stated their willingness to reach an\nagreement, by January 2005, within the World Trade\nOrganization, for \u201csubstantial improvements in market\naccess\u201d for food exports from developing countries.\nThe Johannesburg Summit underlined the\nnecessary linkage between environmental protection\nand natural resources management and the issues of\npoverty, underdevelopment and social justice. The\nSummit demonstrated the interdependence of social,\nenvironmental and economic factors, which must work\nin unison if long-term sustainable development is to be\nachieved. Empirical evidence exists to show that poor\nand weak national economies impact negatively on the\nenvironment, while environmental degradation and the\nover-utilization of natural resources result in declining\neconomies and impoverished communities.\nThe Government of Dominica remains fully\ncommitted to Agenda 21 and the Barbados Programme\nof Action for Small Island Developing States. We\nreiterate our unwavering support for the Johannesburg\nPlan of Action and urge all Member States to make\ngood on their commitments for the successful\nimplementation of all sustainable development\nconventions.\nThe increase in levels of official development\nassistance, to which I alluded earlier, is essential when\nviewed in the context of the implementation of\ndevelopment strategies by small island developing\nStates. It is recognized that the small, open economies\nof these small States require effective means, including\nfinancial resources, to counteract the negative effects\nof globalization and trade liberalization and to foster\nsustainable development.\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica is acutely aware\nof the magnitude of the challenges facing our pursuit of\nsustainable development. Ours is a country with a\nhistory of consistently seeking a national development\npath guided by sustainable development. An integrated\ndevelopment plan, undertaken with the participation of\na diversity of stakeholders and sectors, will shortly be\ncompleted and will provide us with a framework within\nwhich we can address physical, economic and social\nvulnerabilities in an integrated manner.\nAt this time, my Government wishes to place on\nrecord its appreciation of the continued commitment of\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan to the social,\neconomic and infrastructural development of small,\nvulnerable economies very much like its own. As the\nfourteenth largest economy in the world, the Republic\nof China on Taiwan has demonstrated the benefits of\nhaving a global perspective on development. We\nwelcomed the decision of the World Trade\nOrganization, in November 2001, to admit the Republic\nof China on Taiwan as a full member of that\norganization. We look forward to a similar occasion\nwhen the Republic of China on Taiwan will take its\nplace in these halls as a full member of the United\nNations family.\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica joins other\ndelegations in congratulating the African nations for\ntwo important developments. First, the transformation\nof the Organization of African Unity into the African\n34\n\nUnion, which we are confident will be a strong\ninstitution committed to the promotion of peace and\nstability, democracy and human rights, cooperation,\ndevelopment, prosperity and human dignity. Second,\nwe have the programme for socio-economic\nrevitalization of the African continent, the New\nPartnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). The\nUnited Nations has a central role to play in ensuring\nthe success of this bold initiative of the African States\nto eradicate poverty and underdevelopment. These two\ndevelopment provide great examples that our\nCaribbean region can emulate.\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate the resolve of\nthe Millennium Declaration that\n\u201cthe central challenge we face today is to ensure\nthat globalization becomes a positive force for all\nthe world's people.\u201d (A/54/2000, para. 5)\nWe must ensure, through the global and regional\nprogrammes, that globalization truly contributes to\nsustainable development and prosperity for all. We\nwish the 57th General Assembly every success in\nadvancing the goals of peace, democracy, prosperity\nand sustainable development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the\nGovernment and people of Nigeria, I join other\ndelegations in congratulating Mr. Kavan on his election\nas president of the fifty-seventh session of the United\nNations General Assembly. I have no doubt that, under\nhis able leadership, the work of this session will be\nguided to a successful conclusion. Let me also\nacknowledge the work done by his predecessor, who\nguided the affairs of the fifty-sixth session with great\nskill and commitment.\nThe tireless efforts of our Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, on behalf of our Organization must\nnot go unnoticed. He deserves our profuse\nappreciation.\nI welcome the newest member of our\norganization, Switzerland. I have no doubt that this\nnation will bring unique perspectives to the work of the\nUnited Nations, which will enhance the attainment of\nits objectives.\nIt is regrettable that international terrorism\ncontinues to pose a threat to international peace and\nsecurity. There is a need for reviewed and concerted\nefforts on our part to confront the menace until the\nthreat is halted. The various international instruments\naimed at combating terrorism deserve our full support.\nNigeria remains deeply committed to the fight against\nterrorism. We are committed to the early elaboration of\na comprehensive convention on international terrorism.\nDespite the best intentions and efforts of the\ninternational community, a scourge of a different nature\ncontinues to threaten many parts of the world. I refer\nhere to the numerous theatres of conflict around the\nworld. People continue to expend valuable energies and\nresources in fighting each other, often for causes that\nare unproductive. The international community has a\nresponsibility, not only to design appropriate strategies\nfor a measured and early response to snuff out these\nconflicts, but also to find ways and means of\n2\n\naddressing their root causes, and managing them to a\npeaceful conclusion. Only then will true peace and\nstability reign in the world.\nWhile it is true that many of these conflicts have\ntheir root causes in poverty, ignorance, real and\nperceived injustice and the absence of basic freedoms,\nit is equally evident that they are often exacerbated,\nespecially in the case of African conflicts, by the influx\nof small arms into the continent. Illicit trade in small\narms and light weapons has continued unabated, with\ndisastrous consequences for many developing\ncountries. We are deeply concerned that manufacturing\ncountries are not doing enough to limit the\nproliferation of these weapons through appropriate\nsafeguards. We, therefore, call on the international\ncommunity to consider elaborating a legally binding\ninternational instrument to control the supply of these\nweapons to non-State actors.\nThe United Nations peacekeeping role is an\ninvaluable one in the global effort to help contain and\nresolve conflicts around the world. It deserves to be\nsustained and strengthened. Nigeria is proud to be an\nactive participant in this peacekeeping and\npeacemaking effort. We remain committed to this\nresponsibility in the conviction that we are our\nbrother's keeper and in the knowledge that there can be\nno development without peace and stability.\nThe situation in the Middle East continues to pose\na serious threat to international peace and security. We\nreaffirm our commitment to the right of the Palestinian\npeople to their own independence, as well as the right\nof the State of Israel to exist within safe and secure\ninternational borders, consistent with Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973). We therefore\nwelcome the vision and the engagement of the Quartet,\nas well as other sponsors of the Middle East peace\nprocess. I urge the parties in the Middle East conflict to\ncooperate with the international community and give\nthe ongoing peace process a chance. That becomes\nimperative because we cannot afford a situation of\nprotracted conflict in the subregion.\nNigeria notes with concern the threat that the\nsituation in Iraq poses to international peace and\nsecurity. We hold the view that any further escalation\nof tension would lead to very serious consequences.\nNigeria, therefore, urges the parties concerned to\nexercise caution and restraint and that the matter be\nresolved in accordance with the provisions of the\nCharter of the United Nations.\nThere is no shortage of international good will\nand commitment to development. Various declarations\nand programmes eloquently address the need for rapid,\ndurable and sustainable development, as well as the\ndesire for the equitable distribution of the world's\nwealth. In spite of this good will and good intentions\non the part of the international community, more than\nhalf of humanity lives in abject poverty and ignorance.\nFor many countries in Africa, hunger and disease\nremain pervasive and deeply rooted. Human\ndevelopment indices for some of the poorest countries\nare, indeed, unflattering for a world that is so rich but\nwith resources so unevenly distributed.\nIt is our conviction that urgent, concrete action is\nrequired, if the lofty goals we have set for ourselves in\nthe Millennium Declaration to make the world a better\nplace are to be realized. Many developing countries\nrequire assistance from the international community in\nthe form of increased official development assistance\nand foreign direct investment flows and efforts to\nalleviate their excruciating debt burden and enable\nthem to develop their human and material resource\nbase.\nAfrica remains committed to the attainment of the\ngoals of the Millennium Declaration. In that regard, I\nam pleased to state that Africa is seeking to lift itself\nby its own bootstraps, through the New Partnership for\nAfrica's Development (NEPAD). As members are\naware, NEPAD is designed to address, in a sustained\nand coordinated way, many of the developmental\nproblems associated with Africa's underdevelopment.\nWe are encouraged by the support that NEPAD\nhas so far received from the international community.\nThe latest evidence of this support is the outcome of\nthe recent meeting of the Group of 8 in Kananaskis,\nCanada, towards the implementation of the Action\nPlan. It is hoped that the United Nations high-level\nsegment on NEPAD would record greater successes in\nthe much expected endorsement of that initiative by the\ninternational community.\nThis and other programmes designed to improve\nthe living conditions of the majority of humanity may\nnot yield the desired results if one of the greatest\ndangers facing humanity today is not addressed with\nthe commitment and urgency it deserves. I am speaking\nhere of the HIV/AIDS pandemic that continues to bring\n3\n\nhavoc, misery and hopelessness on humanity,\nespecially in Africa where the pandemic is threatening\nto wipe out entire generations. For example, it is\nestimated that out of the 36 million people living with\nHIV/AIDS worldwide, 75 per cent of them are in sub-\nSaharan Africa. The consequent toll on the human and\nmaterial resources of one of the most impoverished\nregions of the world cannot be overemphasized. Not\nonly is the productive population of Africa being\nsystematically decimated by HIV/AIDS, but efforts to\ncombat this and other diseases, such as malaria,\ntuberculosis and other infectious diseases, are also\ndiverting scarce resources away from development\nprogrammes and projects. Massive assistance is\ntherefore required from the international community to\ncomplement the efforts of individual countries.\nNigeria will spare no effort to combat these\nscourges. While we are fully aware of the insidious\nnature of all of these pestilences, the spread of HIV/\nAIDS constitutes by far our greatest source of concern.\nFor that reason, Nigeria is active in contribution to and\nmanagement of the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS.\nWe have also established a national agency for\nthe prevention and control of HIV/AIDS to coordinate\nthe Government's multisectoral approach to the\nprevention, control and management of the pandemic.\nWe pledge to continue to do our best in this human\nstruggle against this powerful, destructive force,\nespecially by generating awareness in the country\nabout its prevention and spread. We continue, however,\nto count on the international community to find cures\nfor these diseases, as well as to give assistance to many\nof our countries in these efforts. The leadership of the\nUnited Nations is critical to the success of these\nefforts.\nI wish once again to draw the Assembly's\nattention to the pernicious issue of corruption and its\nmanifestation at the international level. We have\nalways maintained that it takes two to tango and that\nthe instances of corruption in developing countries\nhave often been supported by encouragement, and\ninducements and the provision of safe havens by the\nindustrialized countries. Thus, we are strongly\nadvocating that efforts to establish a convention against\ncorruption need to be expedited, so that we can have\nglobal action against corruption.\nThere is no doubt that the United Nations has\nserved humanity well. It has come a long way since its\nhumble beginnings in 1945. It remains the only\norganization to which all nations, in varying degrees\nand ways, are associated and committed. Humanity is\nthe better for the existence of the United Nations. The\nOrganization provides the basis for our collective\nsecurity, international cooperation and solidarity, which\nare essential for human coexistence. We must therefore\ncontinue to fine-tune its implementations to make it\nmore responsive to the needs of the times and to\nprepare it for the challenges of the future, some of\nwhich could not have been envisaged by the founding\nMembers.\nI am pleased to note that there is general\nagreement among us on the need to reform the\nOrganization so as to make it more democratic in\nstructure, more efficient in management and more\nmanageable in size. Nigeria is a major proponent of the\nenvisaged reforms, especially those regarding the\nstructure and working methods of the Security Council.\nNigeria envisages a new Security Council in which it\nwill play the role destined by its geopolitical\ncircumstances and the challenges of the twenty-first\ncentury. In this regard, we are willing to contribute to\nefforts and stand ready to support others of like mind\nand circumstances in this endeavour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, I would like, at\nthe outset, to congratulate you on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly and would like to\nexpress my appreciation of the United Nations\nSecretary-General's eloquent statement at the opening\nof this session, which gave good support to\nmultilateralism and international relations and exposed\nthe dangers of unilateralism and hegemony.\nI also wish to congratulate the Swiss\nConfederation on its membership and East Timor on its\nprospective membership to the United Nations.\nThis session is held one year after the tragic\nevents of 11 September 2001, and I would like to\nrenew our condolences to the American people,\nespecially the families of the victims of this tragedy,\nand express to them our deep sympathy.\nIt gives me pleasure to express my sincere\ngratitude to the States of the international community\nand to organizations for their substantive position\nrejecting the United States Administration's threats\nagainst Iraq and for the calls they made for a\ncomprehensive political solution to the impasse in the\nrelationship between Iraq and the Security Council.\nIn response to several appeals made by the United\nNations Secretary-General, peace-loving States and\nregional organizations, my Government decided to\nallow the return of United Nations weapons inspectors\nwithout conditions as a first step towards a\ncomprehensive solution that includes the lifting of\nsanctions imposed on Iraq and the timely\nimplementation of other provisions of relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions, including resolution 687 (1991).\nI was instructed by the President of the Republic\nof Iraq, His Excellency Mr. Saddam Hussein, to convey\nto you, in the allotted time, excerpts of a letter he has\naddressed to the General Assembly, in which His\nExcellency presents Iraq's position on the latest\ndevelopments in the relationship between Iraq and the\nSecurity Council.\nFollowing are excerpts from the letter:\n\u201cIn his speech at the General Assembly that\nwas preceded and accompanied by noisy\npropaganda and extensive preparation, the United\nStates President, instead of paying attention to\ncommon issues of concern to humanity at large,\nhas presented the security problems of his own\ncountry and the sacrifices it has suffered since the\nevents of September 11.\n\u201cIt is a good sign that the United States\nresorted, for the first time since the end of the\ncold war, to the General Assembly to put forward\none of its problems, after years of disregard of the\nweight, effect and opinion of others. Nevertheless,\nthe United States President revealed his basic\npurpose when he jumped to the issue of Iraq without\nany introduction or acceptable progression. He\nportrayed that issue as if it were the most dangerous\nsituation, not only for the life, security and future of\nthe United States, but also for the life, future and\nsecurity of the whole world. Among his\ngeneralizations, which included deliberate\ninsinuations, he presented extreme distortions of\nthe so-called nuclear, biological and chemical\nthreats, so as to make American citizens believe\nthe deliberate insinuation that Iraq was linked to\nthe American people's tragedy of 11 September.\n\u201cHe seems to have assumed that the countries\nof the world are unaware of the American\nAdministration and its methods, or of Iraq and its\nhigh sense of responsibility toward humanity, its\ndesire for peace and stability, or of the fact that the\nIraqis are a creative people in work, production,\nand innovation, in addition to being the heirs of\nthe most ancient human civilizations.\n\u201cThe United States President talked about the\nimportance of the application of democracy on the\npart of the Government of Iraq. He pretended to\ncare for the people of Iraq after he and other\nPresidents before him have killed Iraqis by using\nweapons such as depleted uranium, and by the\nblockade, which is now more than twelve years old,\nin which more than one million and seven hundred\nthousand innocent Iraqis, out of a population of\ntwenty five million citizens, have died.\n\u201cSo, after utilizing the American\npropaganda machine for a long time and spouting\nofficial statements full of lies, distortion, and\nfalsehood, the focus was basically turned on\n25\n\ninciting the American public against Iraq and\npushing it to believe the United States\nAdministration's schemes of aggression as a fait\naccompli, as if it were the solution or the necessary\nrescue that would allow American citizens to live\nin security and stability, after what they had gone\nthrough in the 11 September events.\n\u201cWhen the United States Administration\nrealized that it was necessary to have an\ninternational cover for using force against Iraq\nand that the world did not believe the lies it tried\nto propagate to link Iraq to the September events,\nit changed the issue and began to shed crocodile\ntears about international law and the necessity to\ncomply with the resolutions of international\nlegitimacy, alleging that Iraq is not complying\nwith Security Council resolutions, especially with\nregard to the United Nations inspectors. This\nimplied that Iraq had the intention to develop, or\nthat it already possesses, nuclear, chemical and\nbiological weapons. According to these allegations,\nit might give such weapons to terrorist organizations\nthat pose a threat to world security.\n\u201cNow that Iraq has accepted the return of\nthe United Nations inspectors, we will all be able\nto see how they work. In our past experience with\nthese inspectors (1991-1998), Iraq used to ask the\ninspection teams to do their job in accordance\nwith the declared goals of the Security Council.\nHowever, some of the inspectors went on doing\nintelligence and espionage work that had nothing\nto do with the official mandate of the inspection\nteams. Some of those inspectors have publicly\nadmitted this; some, including an American, are\nstill publicly talking about it. Even Mr. Rolf\nEkeus, the former chief of the United Nations\nSpecial Commission (UNSCOM), has recently\nstated that the inspectors overstepped the limits of\ntheir defined duties by spying on the Iraqi\nleadership. I quote: \u2018The United States and other\nPowers exploited the inspection teams for their\nown political ends, including monitoring\nPresident Saddam Hussein's whereabouts.' He\nalso said that the inspection teams deliberately\ncreated problems to prepare the ground for\npossible military attacks.\n\u201cIraq has always defended the principles\nand values that you have willingly set down in\nthe United Nations Charter and the purposes for\nwhich the Security Council was created, which\nare to preserve security and to establish peace.\nTherefore, by confronting evil for twelve years\nnow, Iraq has not only been defending its own\npatriotism, but rather it has acted as if it were\ndefending your own patriotism. It has been acting\non your behalf without being assigned to do so. In\ntargeting Iraq, the United States Administration is\nacting on behalf of Zionism, which has been\nkilling the heroic people of Palestine, destroying\ntheir property, murdering their children, and\nseeking to impose their domination on the whole\nworld, not only militarily, but also economically\nand politically.\n\u201cThe United States Administration wants to\ndestroy Iraq in order to control Middle East oil,\nand consequently control the politics as well as\nthe oil and economic policies of the whole world.\nIf it succeeds in that, God forbid, it would dictate\nfor each country what it needs for its economic\ndevelopment, what quantities of oil it is allowed to\nbuy, at what prices, along with other conditions.\n\u201cBriefly, what Iraq wants is the respect of\nthe principles of the United Nations Charter and\ninternational law, whether regarding its own\ninterests and sovereignty or those of the other\nMember States of the United Nations. On this\nbasis, Iraq was, and still is, ready to cooperate\nwith the Security Council and international\norganizations. However, Iraq rejects anyone's\ntransgression of its rights, sovereignty, security\nand independence. That would be in contradiction\nwith the principles of the Charter and\ninternational law.\n\u201cHence, Iraq has not rejected the relevant\nresolutions of the Security Council, even though\nthose that relate to Iraq are unjust and at odds\nwith the United Nations Charter and international\nlaw. Iraq rather calls on members of the Security\nCouncil, and on the United States Administration\nin particular, to respect their own obligations\nunder the Charter, under international law and the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. Iraq\ndemands that its inalienable rights, stipulated in\nthose very resolutions, be met, including respect\nof its sovereignty and security, lifting the\nblockade imposed on it, and applying paragraph\n14 of Resolution 687 (1991) to the Zionist entity,\n26\n\nas stipulated in the text and in the same manner as\nit was applied to Iraq.\n\u201cI hereby declare before you that Iraq is\ntotally clear of all nuclear, chemical and\nbiological weapons. If there are anyone amongst\nyou who might still worry that the fabrications\nannounced by American officials about Iraq may\npossibly be true, our country is ready to receive\nany scientific experts accompanied by politicians\nyou choose to represent any one of your countries\nto tell us which places and scientific and\nindustrial installations they would wish to see,\nparticularly those about which the American\nofficials have been fabricating false stories,\nalleging that they contain prohibited materials or\nactivities. If such experts and politicians visit\nIraq, we shall provide them with all the facilities\nthey need to achieve their objective, that is, to see\nthe true facts as they are.\n\u201cAs what matters for us basically is that our\nrights, sovereignty and security be respected in\naccordance with international law, we have\naccepted the return of the inspection teams to\nIraq, taking into consideration the arrangements\nthat should safeguard these principles and\nachieve, with transparency, the goal of making\nsure that Iraq no longer possesses nuclear,\nbiological and chemical weapons of mass\ndestruction. Along with you, we are waiting to see.\n\u201cThe blockade imposed upon Iraq has been\nin place for more than 12 years now, during\nwhich time our assets and oil revenues have been\nfrozen and we have been unable to use them\nexcept through an inefficient United Nations-run\nsystem that has already proven to be unfeasible.\nSubstantial amounts of our revenues have been\nillegitimately seized in a manner tantamount to\nlooting and contrary to the principles enshrined in\nthe United Nations Charter.\n\u201cWe therefore call for a discussion of the\nissue of the inspection teams in accordance with\ninternational law. That should be done on a\ncomprehensive basis with a discussion of Iraq's\nobligations, including the issue of the inspection\nteams as well as the obligations of the Security\nCouncil towards Iraq, as stated in the resolutions\nthemselves, particularly resolution 687 (1991).\nReciprocal obligations exist of which the Security\nCouncil has implemented nothing, including the\nobligation to respect Iraq's sovereignty, which is\nbeing violated by America and Britain on a daily\nbasis through their ongoing aggression and the\nartificially drawn parallel latitude lines over\nnorthern and southern Iraq.\n\u201cYou may notice how the policy of the\nZionist entity, which has usurped Palestine and\nother Arab territories since 1948, and afterwards,\nhas now become as one with the policies and\ncapabilities of the United States.\n\u201cThe United States Administration has been\nmaking up problems with Iraq in order to derail\nthe application of paragraph 14 of resolution 687\n(1991) and to prevent the Security Council from\nlifting the blockade imposed on Iraq. The reason\nlies in the fact that the counter-obligations under\nrelevant resolutions of the Security Council,\nincluding resolution 687 (1991) of 3 April 1991,\ncontain a clear paragraph demanding that the\nMiddle East be made a zone free from weapons of\nmass destruction. Thus the American\nAdministration does not want to embarrass the\nZionist entity or deprive it of the nuclear,\nchemical and biological weapons it actually\npossesses. It is also because the United States\nAdministration is aware that Iraq has indeed\nhonoured all its obligations and is demanding,\nalong with other Arab countries, that paragraph\n14 be applied to the Zionist entity.\n\u201cIraq has been keen to see the inspection\nissue discussed between the Security Council and\nIraq, through the United Nations Secretary-\nGeneral and the representatives of Iraq, with a\nview to reaching a balanced formula based on the\nprinciples of the Charter and the relevant\nresolutions of the Security Council, and within a\ncomprehensive solution which should bring to an\nend the cyclone of American accusations and\nfabricated crises against Iraq. At the same time,\nthis would reassure Iraq with regard to its\nsecurity, sovereignty, territorial integrity and its\nright to choose its own way without interference,\nin accordance with the rules established in the\nCharter of the United Nations.\n\u201cThe United States President said in his\nspeech that Iraq is providing financial support to\nthe Palestinian people. My comment is that this is\n27\n\ncorrect. Yet we feel that the support we have\nextended has not been as great as we would have\nhoped, because of the circumstances which have\ncurtailed our means. In extending this support, we\nact in accordance with the United Nations Charter\nand the resolutions of the Assembly, in which the\nnational struggle of peoples against occupation\nand colonialism is considered to be an inalienable\nnational right.\n\u201cBut what grounds does America and its\nPresidents have to support the Zionist entity,\nwhich has been occupying Palestine and other\nArab territories and committing its criminal\npolicy of killing Palestinians, destroying their\nproperty and encroaching upon, and destroying,\nthe holy places of Muslims and Christians there?\nWhat principles and what laws does the American\nPresident rely on in killing Iraqis, blockading\ntheir country, destroying their property and\ninterfering in their internal affairs?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to begin by offering\nMr. Jan Kavan my Government's warm congratulations\nas he assumes the presidency of the General Assembly.\nHe has served the Czech Republic so well as Foreign\nMinister, and I have full faith in his ability to meet the\nnumerous challenges that the fifty-seventh session of\nthe General Assembly will no doubt present. I assure\nhim of my delegation's full support in the execution of\nhis duties.\nAllow me also to take this opportunity to express\nmy appreciation to Mr. Han Seung-soo for the skill and\ndedication with which he served this body during the\nsession that has just come to a close.\nIt gives the Government of Malta great pleasure\nto welcome the recent admission of the Swiss\nConfederation to our family of nations. We look\nforward to also welcoming among us the Democratic\nRepublic of East Timor. Their addition serves to further\nstrengthen the trust and belief of all our nations that\ndialogue within a multilateral context is both\nworthwhile and irreplaceable.\nOver the past couple of weeks the international\ncommunity has been seized of the issue of sustainable\ndevelopment. Malta participated actively in the World\nSummit on Sustainable Development, held in South\nAfrica, and although the Summit's very ambitious\nobjectives could not all be reached, we are satisfied\nthat a plan of action \u2014 the Plan of Implementation \u2014\nwith specific targets to tackle key development\nproblems has been adopted. Throughout the\nnegotiations, Malta worked closely with the European\nUnion to include concrete plans and targets in the plan\nof action. As a result, the Summit agreed on a series of\ncommitments in priority areas such as water and\nsanitation, desertification, energy and biodiversity. It is\nour hope that the plan of action will attract the\nnecessary additional resources that will make its\nimplementation possible, thereby making sustainable\ndevelopment a reality for an ever-increasing proportion\nof humanity.\nWhen I had the honour to address the Assembly\nat the last general debate, in November 2001, I pledged\nmy Government's full support for the Franco-German\ninitiative against the reproductive cloning of human\nbeings. As a sponsor of resolution 56/93, which\nestablished the relevant Ad Hoc Committee, we have\ncarefully followed the deliberations within the\nCommittee on the philosophical, medical, legal and\nethical considerations associated with this pressing\nissue. This was a necessary debate which brought to\nthe fore the consensus that exists on the need to\n12\n\nrespond to the challenges posed by scientists who are\nunable or unwilling to recognize the deep moral\nimplications of their actions, as well as the dangers that\nthey may pose to mankind. The convergence of\npolitical will has now been manifested. The time is\ntherefore ripe for the Ad Hoc Committee to be given a\nclear mandate to negotiate a convention on this matter.\nMy Government will strive for the timely conclusion of\nnegotiations in this regard, preferably before the end of\n2003. However, whether or not the international\ncommunity concludes such a convention before\nattempts at reproductive human cloning actually\nmaterialize, it is imperative that, through international\naction and national legislation, Member States deny\nsafe haven to those scientists willing to defy the\ninternational community.\nBefore this year is out we shall be\ncommemorating the twentieth anniversary of the\nopening for signature of the United Nations\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. When, as a newly\nindependent State, Malta called for the commencement\nof negotiations on such a convention, it was concerned\nwith the numerous unresolved issues of the rights and\nobligations of States with regard to seas and oceans,\nand with the seeds of countless conflicts that they\nmight sow. It is today impossible to speculate on the\nnumber of occasions on which the legal certainties that\nthe Convention brought about have helped to defuse,\ndissipate or prevent altogether the scourge of conflict\nand war. It is the curse of international law in our times\nto make the news headlines only when it fails, while\npassing unnoticed and unsung when it succeeds.\nWe would do well to remain conscious of the role\nthat international law, based on the multilateral\nprocess, plays in the prevention of conflict and the\navoidance of threats to international security. That is to\nsay, we would do well to remember the role it plays in\nupholding the central mandate of the United Nations\nitself. The role of the instruments of international law,\nand in particular those such as the Convention on the\nLaw of the Sea, should be recognized for the\ncontribution they provide in that regard.\nUnited Nations Headquarters has just played host\nto the historic first session of the Assembly of States\nParties to the Rome Statute of the International\nCriminal Court. The complex changes to national\nlegislation necessary to allow for Malta's ratification of\nthe Rome Statute have now reached an advanced stage\nand are expected to be presented to Parliament in the\ncoming days, thus enabling Malta to formally deposit\nits instrument of ratification very soon.\nThe new International Criminal Court (ICC) has\nits roots in the atrocities carried out during the last\ncentury \u2014 not least those addressed at the Nuremberg\ntrials. The ICC is thus a product of the lessons learned\nover time and of the widespread political will that has\nled to the creation of a credible deterrent to the would-\nbe perpetrators of the most heinous crimes. The ICC\nthus provides an effective, competent and fair forum\nwhere those individuals may be tried. The\nestablishment of the Court also represents a major\nbreakthrough in international law and one which has\nbecome more \u2014 and not less \u2014 crucial now that\nterrorism has imposed itself high on our international\nagenda.\nThe terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 still\nloom large in our memories. The anniversary of that\ntragedy has again filled our television screens with\nhorrific scenes of suffering and death. It has served to\nremind us of the resolve which is necessary in the face\nof such horror. My Government has taken part in the\nfight against international terrorism with full\ndetermination, and will continue to do so. This is\nevidenced not only by our thorough implementation of\nthe international conventions on terrorism and the\nongoing process towards the implementation of\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) but also by\never-tighter controls and scrutiny at our ports. We\nundertake further to intensify our efforts in this field in\norder to assist in the permanent eradication of terrorism\nin whatever shape or form.\nThe continued turbulence in the Middle East also\ncontinues to be a source of great concern to my\nGovernment. The cycle of violence that continues to\nengulf the region provides a confirmation, if ever one\nwere needed, that there is no purely military solution to\nthe conflict. The extrajudicial killings of Palestinians,\nthe deliberate destruction of the property and\nlivelihoods of innocent civilians and the subjection of\nthe entire Palestinian population to collective\npunishment does not dim the wholly legitimate\naspirations of the Palestinian people to a State of their\nown.\nLikewise, the targeting of Israeli civilians in\nsuicide bombings and other forms of destruction of the\nlives and property of innocent civilians does untold\n13\n\nharm to the cause the perpetrators of those crimes\nclaim to support.\nNo cause, no argument and no justification can\nlegitimize these abhorrent acts by either party to the\nconflict.\nMy Government looks on in anguish as a fence,\nreminiscent of the Berlin wall, that most shameful of\nsymbols of the twentieth century, slowly takes shape. It\nis a harrowing reminder of how little mankind has\nlearned from the past, particularly if we look back to\nthe outbreak of violence in the region since September\n2000.\nUnjustified preconditions to the start of political\nnegotiations further hinder any progress in the\ndiscussions on a two-State solution to the conflict.\nNegotiations, which must start without further delay,\nmust be built on the clear and plain language of\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338\n(1973) and the principle of land for peace. The recent\ninitiative by the States members of the European Union\nin presenting a road map for the Middle East which\noutlines a three-stage process leading to the creation of\na Palestinian State by 2005 provides a genuine basis\nfor taking negotiations forward. The international\ncommunity looks to the Quartet to advance in that\ndirection with urgency.\nAn issue which continues to persist in the\nMediterranean is the situation in Cyprus, which has\nremained a cause of concern for more than 25 years.\nWe earnestly hope that an early settlement of the\nCyprus question will be found and reiterate our full\nsupport for efforts to find a solution on the basis of the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. The imminent\naccession of Cyprus to the European Union should\nprovide the necessary impetus for the resolution of this\nlong-standing problem.\nMalta is encouraged by the efforts of the\nSecretary-General to engage the Organization in the\nquest to achieve a resolution to the situation with\nregard to Iraq before it deteriorates any further. My\nGovernment calls upon the Iraqi Government to\ncomply with all its obligations under all the provisions\nof relevant Security Council resolutions, in particular\nthose concerning disarmament with respect to weapons\nof mass destruction. Iraq must meet its commitments\nand allow the re-entry of United Nations inspectors\ninto its territory without any preconditions and as\nstipulated by the Security Council.\nThe international community should spare no\neffort in exploring all political and diplomatic options\nthat would or could assist in resolving the issue. Malta\nis in agreement with the Secretary-General that if Iraq\nfails to meet its obligations, the Security Council, as\nthe organ entrusted with the primary responsibility for\nthe maintenance of international peace and security,\nmust shoulder its responsibilities. The Security Council\nhas to ensure compliance with its own resolutions in\nthe interest of the international rule of law.\nMalta's location at the centre of the\nMediterranean has provided us with opportunities for\ntrade and development, which we have been relatively\nsuccessful at exploiting in the interest of our island,\nwhich is otherwise bereft of natural resources. Our\nstrategic location is, however, now also the scene of\nanother socio-economic phenomenon of a much less\nencouraging nature. I speak here of the poverty divide\nthat cuts across the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe countries of the Mediterranean littoral share\nmuch in terms of history, culture and way of life.\nHowever the ever more apparent disparities of wealth\ncontinue to fuel the movement of thousands of people\nfrom the southern Mediterranean and further afield to\nentrust their lives and hopes into the hands of\nunscrupulous individuals. These traffickers of human\nbeings, willing to exploit misery and desperation, have\nlittle respect for human life and often abandon the\nwould-be immigrants to the elements once they have\nsecured their ill-gotten gains. My Government has\nincreased the punishment meted out to those found\nguilty of such heinous acts. We have also bolstered our\nsurveillance and rescue capability within our territorial\nwaters and are simultaneously seeking to provide\ntreatment that is as humane as possible to the victims\nthat land on our shores. These efforts have been made,\nhowever, in the full knowledge that they deal more\nwith the symptoms of the phenomenon of human\ntrafficking than with its root causes.\nThe imperative of narrowing the wealth divide\nacross the Mediterranean is one of the philosophical\ncornerstones of the Euro-Med process, which exists to\nbring the European Union and 12 Mediterranean States\ntogether on a number of issues of common concern.\nMalta has been an avid supporter of the process since\nits inception and looks forward to developing its role\nfurther within this forum as a member of the European\nUnion in the near future.\n14\n\nMy Government believes that the accession of\nMalta to the European Union will serve to further\nenhance our capability to promote peace and prosperity\nwithin the Mediterranean, given our reputation as an\nhonest broker that can identify with both sides of the\nMediterranean.\nInasmuch as this is the case, we also believe that\nmembership in the Union will also serve to strengthen\nour own internal workings at all levels of society,\nbringing prosperity to the Maltese both now and for the\nyears to come. Indeed, we believe that membership in\nthe European Union constitutes a natural progression\nfor Malta, given our long-standing historical, cultural\nand political ties with the Union.\nThe negotiations concerning membership that are\ncurrently under way are nearing completion, and we\nlook forward to joining this union of like-minded\nStates at its next enlargement, in line with the timelines\nestablished at the Nice meeting of the European\nCouncil.\nMalta has always played a role on the\ninternational scene far in excess of its size. This we\nintend to continue, and I anticipate that all our efforts\nwill combine with those of the other nations of the\nworld to bring about improvements in all the areas that\nurgently call for our immediate attention. This\nunswerving determination will guide our efforts in the\nvarious forums of which we form part and in the\nactivities we undertake, as together we strive to make a\nbetter and secure world for this and future generations.\nI wish the President every success in his\nendeavours in presiding over the General Assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I\nam confident that with your experience you will guide\nthis session to a fruitful conclusion. I would also like to\nextend my thanks to your predecessor, Ambassador\nHan Seung-soo of South Korea, for his excellent\nstewardship of the previous session of the General\nAssembly.\nSomalia welcomes the Democratic Republic of\nEast Timor and the Swiss Confederation to the\nmembership of this family of nations. This is a further\nstep towards the realization of the goal of the\nuniversality of the United Nations Organization.\nA year after the tragic events of 11 September\n2001, we in Somalia continue to share the feelings of\npain and loss of the Government and the people of the\nUnited States. We must, as a community of nations, act\nin unison to combat the scourge of terrorism.\nIn this regard, the Transitional National\nGovernment of Somalia continues to be a reliable\npartner in the campaign against terrorism. It is my\nprivilege to announce to the Assembly that my\nGovernment this year signed the Convention for the\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism.\nWe have also started the process of acceding to\nthe Convention on the Prevention and Combating of\nTerrorism of the African Union. We are also working\non the implementation of the other requirements of\nresolution 1373 (2001). Furthermore, we are committed\nto fully cooperating with other countries on a bilateral\nbasis in the fight against terrorism and continue to\nidentify concrete areas of such cooperation. My\nGovernment's resolve in this regard is not based on any\nshort-term tactical considerations but is unequivocal\nand based on solid principles.\nWe would like to commend the United Nations\nfor organizing a number of international conferences in\n2002, starting with the International Conference on\nFinancing for Development and the recent World\nSummit on Sustainable Development, held in\nJohannesburg, South Africa. We also applaud the\n22\n\nUnited Nations for dedicating a day of discussions on\nthe New Partnership for Africa's Development\n(NEPAD), which focused on the development needs of\nthe African continent.\nWe strongly feel that the international community\nshould pay more attention to the development needs of\nthe least developed countries. Donors and creditors\nshould be able to do much more in the areas of trade,\ndebt and aid. We believe that free and fair trade is a\nvehicle for growth and development, and that thus we\nare required to make greater efforts to ensure that\nmultilateral trading caters to the urgent and special\nneeds of the least developed countries.\nIn this regard, we are encouraged by Canada's\nunilateral decision to lift tariffs on African exports to\nCanada and to abolish subsidies on agricultural\nproducts. It is our hope that other developed countries\nwill follow the example set by Canada.\nWith regard to debt, we believe that, unless the\nmassive debts owed by the least developed countries\nare completely cancelled, those countries will remain\nstrangled by interest and loan principal payments.\nAid can be another engine for development and\ngrowth and, in this respect, the donors must honour the\nagreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product\nfor official development assistance.\nWe cannot but address the plight of the\nPalestinian people, who are subjected to daily horrors.\nThe killing of innocent civilians, including women and\nchildren, the destruction of houses and the daily\nhumiliations inflicted upon the Palestinian people by\nIsrael must be condemned by the international\ncommunity.\nIt is unconscionable for the international\ncommunity to stand idly by and watch the continuous\nsiege of President Yasser Arafat and the premeditated\ndestruction of the Palestinian Authority. The people of\nPalestine, who continue to suffer under the Israeli\noccupation, have an inalienable right to a State of their\nown and to choose their own leadership and\ninstitutions. The systematic violation of the\nfundamental human rights of the Palestinian people\nmust be brought to an end.\nThe scourge of conflicts has been afflicting the\nAfrican continent for decades. In fact, Africa at one\ntime was dubbed the \u201ccontinent of conflict\u201d. It is\ngratifying to note that there is a new horizon \u2014 that a\nnew dawn is illuminating the darker parts of our\ncontinent in conflict. Conflict resolution by Africans\nthemselves is the motto today. A strong wind of peace\nis blowing in Africa. In Sierra Leone and Liberia in the\nMano river region; in Angola; in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi in the\nGreat Lakes region; and in Ethiopia, Eritrea and the\nSudan in the Horn of Africa, the ship of peace is\nsailing. We strongly welcome this movement towards\npeace in the African continent.\nAs members are aware, Somalia has been an area\nof a conflict, a conflict that brought untold suffering to\nthe people of Somalia, a disastrous civil war fomented\nby unpatriotic warlords, resulting in the destruction of\nall State institutions, the death of hundreds of\nthousands of Somalis and the displacement of millions.\nDespite the good intentions of the United Nations,\nSomalia suffered from the neglect of the international\ncommunity, especially after 1993. The Somali conflict\nseemed intractable.\nIt was not until August 2000 that a Transitional\nNational Government and a Transitional National\nAssembly were constituted and a head of State, His\nExcellency Mr. Abdikassim Salad Hassan, was elected.\nThat was a result of a conference held in Arta, in the\nRepublic of Djibouti, attended by more than 3,000\nSomalis from all regions and all walks of life,\nincluding traditional leaders, intellectuals, business\npersons and women. The warlords were repeatedly\ninvited and opted not to participate.\nThe Transitional National Government of\nSomalia has continued to engage in dialogue those who\nchoose to be outside the Arta process, with a view to\nbringing them on board. We have been persistent in\nencouraging them to renounce war as a means of\nachieving political gains, and we share our vision of\npeace and national reconciliation in Somalia and for\nthe Somali people.\nIn our endeavours to achieve peace and stability\nin Somalia, we have also engaged our brothers\nelsewhere in the subregion, regional organizations and\nthe United Nations, to assist us in the search for\ndurable peace in Somalia.\nI am happy to note that the Intergovernmental\nAuthority on Development (IGAD), with the strong\nsupport of the international community, has undertaken\na serious peace initiative for Somalia. IGAD has\nmandated the three frontline States of Kenya, Djibouti\n23\n\nand Ethiopia, under the chairmanship of His\nExcellency President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, to\nwork out the modalities and time frames for completing\nthe Arta peace process. This has the support of the\ncurrent Chairman of IGAD, His Excellency Mr. Omer\nAl-Bashir, President of the Republic of Sudan, and the\nheads of State of other IGAD countries. The IGAD\nprocess for the completion of the Arta process has\nstreamlined the various and often conflicting initiatives\nfor the first time.\nIGAD has announced that a conference for the\ncompletion of the reconciliation process will be held in\nKenya on 15 October 2002. The Transitional National\nGovernment will participate. We will participate with\nan open mind and with the interest of the Somali\npeople as our foremost priority. The Transitional\nNational Government will spare no effort to make the\nnational reconciliation conference a success. We are\ngratified that the international community has\nrecognized that the Arta peace process continues to be\nthe most viable basis for peace and national\nreconciliation in Somalia. It is our hope that those\nregional administrations and other parties that have\nbeen outside the Arta process will share our vision for\npeace and stability in Somalia.\nIn this regard, it is of critical importance that the\ninternational community send a clear message to all the\nSomali participants to support the IGAD-sponsored\nconference in Kenya, making clear that those who try\nto sabotage it or refuse to participate will be sanctioned\nby the international community.\nEqually important is the issue of guarantees for\nthe outcome of the reconciliation conference. We\nbelieve and request that the international community\nshould put in place regional and international measures\nguaranteeing both the finality and the legality of the\noutcome of the conference in Kenya. The international\nand regional guarantees must ensure that sanctions will\nbe imposed on any Somali group that rejects the\noutcome of the reconciliation conference in Kenya.\nWhen the Somali parties agree on a peace\nframework during the October conference in Kenya,\nthere will be an urgent need for international\npeacekeepers. There will also be an urgent need for\ndisarmament and for the rebuilding of national\ninstitutions in Somalia. We urge the United Nations to\nbe ready for this and to plan to meet the new\nchallenges of disarmament, the demobilization of\nmilitias and reconstruction.\nThe wind of peace that is blowing across the\nAfrican continent has finally reached Somalia. As the\nTransitional National Government, we are committed\nto the re-emergence of a new Somalia that is at peace\nwith itself, its neighbours and the world. As a law-\nabiding State, we pledge to respect our obligations\nunder the United Nations Charter and the Constitutive\nAct of the African Union and to remain a partner for\npeace and development in our continent and throughout\nthe world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Your ample diplomatic skills\nare well known. I wish also to thank your predecessor\nfor his good conduct of the preceding session. I also\nwish to extend my thanks to His Excellency the\nSecretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan for the quality of\n30\n\nthe report that he presented to us on the work of our\nOrganization and to wish him further success in the\ndischarge of his tasks.\nI am pleased in this connection to convey to you\nand all the participants in this session the greetings of\nHis Excellency President Abdullah Saleh of Yemen,\nand his sincere wish that the work of this session be\nhighly successful, particularly when it is convening\nunder grave and internationally important\ncircumstances.\nThis fifty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly of the United Nations is being held while the\nworld still vividly remembers the terrorist acts and the\ntragic and terrifying disaster, which befell the United\nStates on 11 September 2001 and which represented a\ngrave development in terrorist acts. This awakened the\ninternational community, requiring it to mobilize all its\npotential to face that threat to international peace and\nstability. The proliferation of international terrorism\nand the exorbitant price it has imposed on many\npeoples and States, including my country, has made\nfighting terrorism an obligation and a responsibility for\nsafeguarding peace, stability and development.\nMy country was among the first States to suffer\nfrom terrorism and its harmful repercussions still affect\nus. We have not hesitated to face that danger. Prior to\nthe September 2001 events, we drew the attention of\nthe international community to the need to unify efforts\nto combat terrorism and eradicate it before it took root.\nWhile doing its best to combat terrorism, my\ncountry has emphasized the need to convene an\ninternational conference on terrorism under the\nauspices of the United Nations so that we can reach a\nunified definition thereof. We emphasize the need to\ndistinguish between terrorism and the right of peoples\nto resist occupation. We need to end the causes that\ncreate a fertile climate for fostering terrorism.\nIsraeli violence and terrorism levelled against the\ndefenceless Palestinian people constitute a genuine\nobstacle to the achievement of a just and\ncomprehensive peace and create hotbeds of extremism\nand terrorism. Such violence impedes international\nefforts and initiatives to solve the Middle East\nquestion, while threatening stability, security and\nprosperity in the region. It also increases the incidence\nof violence and extremism and presages unpredictable\nconsequences. Consequently, the international\ncommunity must exert the utmost pressure on Israel to\nimplement Security Council resolutions 242 (1967),\n338 (1973) and 1397 (2002), and General Assembly\nresolution 194 (III) of 1948 and to withdraw from all\noccupied Arab territories \u2014 Palestinian, Syrian and\nLebanese \u2014 and return to the 4 June 1967 borders. The\ninternational community must work towards\nestablishing a Palestinian State, with Al-Quds Al-\nSharif as its capital.\nWe reiterate our position that the Arab peace\ninitiative constitutes an integrated framework for the\nachievement of peace. Peace for Israel will not be\nachieved unless it withdraws from the occupied\nPalestinian territories, helps to re-establish the\nPalestinian security institutions and grants the\nPalestinian Authority control over its own territory.\nWe stress that the Palestinian people are solely\nresponsible for choosing their leadership and\nrepresentatives for negotiating a final settlement. In\nthis connection, we look forward to the outcome of the\nefforts led by the United States and the other members\nof the \u201cquartet\u201d to solve the Middle East question. We\nhope that the United States vision will be transformed\ninto a time-bound programme that will lay down\nguidelines to prevent Israel from circumventing any\nnew agreement, as it did those of Oslo, Camp David\nand Sharm el-Sheikh, through recent statements by\nSharon.\nSince the Republic of Yemen is interested in the\nsecurity and stability of the Middle East, we emphasize\nthe need for Israel to get rid of its nuclear arsenal and\nto subject its nuclear facilities to international\nsupervision. Israel should strive to free the Middle East\nregion of weapons of mass destruction.\nThe policy of imposing sanctions on some Arab\nand Islamic countries, Iraq in particular, should be\ntackled to ease the considerable harm done to the Iraqi\npeople. Here, I emphasize my country's position that\nthe sanctions imposed on Iraq should be lifted. We\nreject the use of force against Iraq as long as it abides\nby international resolutions.\nYemen warns of the gravity of using force against\nIraq. We also warn of the disastrous consequences for\nthe region if force is used and if waging war takes\nprecedence over solving the problem peacefully. A\npeaceful approach, such as bringing back the inspectors\nand clearing up the doubts about Iraq's possession of\nweapons of mass destruction, should be taken. We call\nfor the lifting of sanctions against Libya, Sudan and\n31\n\nCuba and for continuing dialogue as a means to\nachieve fair settlements, to safeguard the rights of the\nconcerned parties and to respect their sovereignty and\nsystems of government.\nBased on our interest in the situation in Somalia\nand our endeavours to achieve peace and stability\nthere, we call on the international community to\nintensify its efforts to bring peace to that country and\nto support the peace process led by the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development, so as to\npreserve the security, territorial integrity and\nsovereignty of Somalia. We are ready to contribute to\nthis international political endeavour.\nMy country is of the view that current efforts to\nreform and restructure the United Nations, including\nSecurity Council reform, should enhance the\nOrganization's role and achieve broader participation\nand more equitable representation in the Council, in\nkeeping with the principles of the sovereign equality of\nStates and equitable geographical distribution.\nYemen attaches great importance to the\nMillennium Declaration adopted during the Millennium\nSummit. It paves the way to new relations in the\ntwenty-first century; it calls for encouraging dialogue\namong civilizations and for the spread of the culture of\npeace; and it calls on richer States to shoulder their\nresponsibility towards least developed countries in\nfacing the challenges of poverty and deadly disease. In\nfact, we have not seen the implementation of any of\nthose principles. We therefore call upon States to abide\nby the Millennium Declaration and implement it in\norder to engender better relations between the rich and\nthe poor; to remove the spectre of the clash of\ncivilizations and races; to enhance the high principles\nand values of religions; and to remove the distorted\nview of the tolerant Islamic religion that has been\npropagated by others.\nThe developing countries are suffering from\ndifficult economic conditions due to poverty,\nunemployment, declining living standards, over-\npopulation, mismanagement, debt servicing, and so\nforth, in addition to the burdens imposed by new\neconomic policies. For these States to be fully\nintegrated into the international economy, they need\nnew opportunities and support so that they can build\ntheir economies and carry out administrative and\neconomic structural reforms. They need further\nfinancial assistance and opportunities to compete, as\nwell as technology transfers on concessional terms.\nThey should also benefit from investments and\ncooperation, and free trade zones need to be\nestablished. We should try to implement the\nrecommendations of the Third United Nations\nConference on the Least Developed Countries and\ncancel the accumulated debts of those countries.\nMy Government is making strenuous efforts to\nachieve full development, to complete the building of\nan infrastructure, and to eliminate poverty. Thus, we\nhave implemented a programme of administrative,\nfinancial and economic reform, and have updated the\ninvestment law to attract foreign capital, with a view to\nbolstering the service and economic sectors. We have\nbegun a carefully prepared and well balanced\nprivatization programme and are making efforts to join\nthe World Trade Organization and integrate ourselves\ninto world economy.\nAt this session, we look forward to the adoption\nof important resolutions that will enhance our joint\ncampaign to achieve security and stability, welfare and\nprosperity for our peoples. I am confident that our\nconcerted efforts will lead to the success of this session\nand will help us achieve the results we desire.\nIn conclusion, I would like to extend my\ncongratulations to Switzerland on its admission as a\nMember of the Organization and to Timor-Leste on its\ncoming admission. They will make a fresh contribution\nto the United Nations."

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the delegation\nof Jamaica, I express congratulations to you, Sir, on\nyour assumption of the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-seventh session. We pledge our\nfull cooperation with you in the work of this session.\nWe also express our deep gratitude to the outgoing\nPresident, Mr. Han Seung-soo, under whose guidance\nthe fifty-sixth session was successfully completed.\nJamaica welcomes the Swiss Confederation as a\nMember of the family of the United Nations, and we\nlook forward to welcoming East Timor when it\nassumes membership in the Organization later during\nthis session.\nForty years ago on this day, 18 September,\nJamaica joined the family of the United Nations as its\n106th member. It was one of our first foreign policy\ninitiatives upon achieving independence. In taking that\nstep, Jamaica signalled its readiness to assume its\nobligations as a member of the international\ncommunity and to contribute to the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security and to the promotion\n31\n\nof economic and social progress through multilateral\ncooperation within the United Nations system. Today,\non its fortieth anniversary, Jamaica reaffirms its faith in\nthe United Nations and proclaims its unwavering\ncommitment to multilateralism.\nOver its 40 years Jamaica has played its part\nthrough active participation in widening the reach of\nthe United Nations into a range of activities and\nprogrammes critical to global development and world\npeace. Our policy is to support the strengthening of the\nUnited Nations system and to uphold its moral\nauthority. In a world of many nations with diverse\ninterests and of great disparities in wealth and military\npower, it is an indispensable instrument in the\npromotion of the rule of law in international affairs and\nin the peaceful settlement of disputes.\nWith the changing nature and growing complexity\nof international affairs, especially in the context of\nglobalization and with the emergence of new\nchallenges to peace and security, the fulfilment of the\nUnited Nations' role remains critical. Now, more than\never before, we need to strengthen the structures and\ninstitutions of the international system to safeguard our\ncommon interests in achieving a global order of peace\nand economic and social progress for all.\nOver the past year, dramatic events have occurred\nwhich have brought old and new issues to the forefront\nof attention. We recall the shock and horror of the\nterrorist attacks on 11 September; the ensuing war in\nAfghanistan; the outbreak of renewed violence in the\nMiddle East between Israelis and Palestinians; the\nescalation of old tensions in South Asia; and more\nrecently, the threat of a new war in Iraq. All of these\nwere given special attention by the Secretary-General\nin the presentation of his report to the General\nAssembly last Thursday. Jamaica commends the\nSecretary-General for the clarity of his vision on the\nrole of the United Nations in the resolution of current\nglobal problems.\nOf high importance on the agenda for immediate\naction is the situation in the Middle East, where\nrecently we have witnessed so much death, destruction\nand human suffering, particularly among civilians. It\nshould now be clear that the only true way to find\npeace and security is through laying the foundations for\na just and durable settlement. What is needed now is a\nplan to move the process forward towards the\nconvening of a peace conference. There has emerged a\nsignificant level of consensus on the main elements of\na settlement \u2014 the withdrawal of Israel from occupied\nPalestinian territory; the exercise of self-determination\nfor the Palestinian people and the establishment of\narrangements for the two States of Israel and Palestine\nto coexist within clearly defined and internationally\nrecognized boundaries. We believe it is important and\nurgent that advantage is taken of the present situation\nof relative calm to proceed towards negotiations\ninvolving the leadership of Israel and the Palestinian\nAuthority.\nWith regard to Iraq, which has been the subject of\nso much debate in recent weeks, it is up to the Security\nCouncil to carry out its responsibilities in a manner\nbroadly acceptable to the international community and\nto preclude unilateral actions that could lead to\nunpredictable consequences and to wider instability in\nthe region. This is an important moment for the United\nNations, and we expect the Security Council to act in\naccordance with the Charter to safeguard the integrity\nof the international system and to ensure the\nmaintenance of peace.\nTo make the world a safer place requires\nmeasures to be adopted on a broad front. The\nelimination of terrorism is a task requiring cooperation\nby the entire international community. The\ncomprehensive measures set out in Security Council\nresolution 1373 (2001) establish the framework for\naction, and Jamaica is doing its part in that effort. At\nthe same time, it should be recognized that for\nachievement of the long-term objectives, it is necessary\nto address the root causes of terrorism in their political,\neconomic, social and psychological dimensions. It is\nalso important that, in the campaign against terrorism,\nthere should be no targeting or stigmatizing of\nparticular ethnic groups or religious communities; nor\nshould it become the basis for intolerance, persecution\nor discrimination against minority groups or for the\nviolation of human rights.\nLinked to the question of terrorism are security\nproblems arising from the continued growth in the\nillicit trade in narcotics and the illicit transfer of guns\nand other weapons which have become inseparable\nelements in the operations of transnational crime. This\nis particularly the case in the Caribbean, where this\nphenomenon has assumed alarming proportions in the\nera of globalization. A growing network of illicit trade\nhas developed in drugs and weapons, which is\nsubverting the internal security of our Caribbean States\n32\n\nand threatening social stability. We acknowledge\nongoing efforts at the regional and bilateral levels to\naddress these security concerns, but more needs to be\ndone, particularly in regulating, monitoring and\nreporting transfers in small arms in jurisdictions in\nwhich these weapons are produced.\nThese are some of the negative features that\naccompany globalization and add to the problems\nfacing developing countries. The globalization of trade,\nfinance and the means of production presents even\ngreater challenges. The contraction of overall\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) and foreign direct\ninvestment flows, and the volatility in short-term\ncapital flows, have resulted over time in declining\ngrowth rates and increasing poverty, thus widening the\ngap between rich and poor countries. The opportunities\nfor economic growth and prosperity promised by\nglobalization have, therefore, not materialized for the\nmajority. Instead, developing countries have been\nplaced in peril in a system in which survival will\nremain an uphill struggle against dislocation and\nmarginalization. Without some arrangement to promote\ngreater equity in the sharing of the benefits of\nglobalization, we will witness a pattern of continued\nenrichment of only those endowed with the resources,\ncapital stocks and technology, who can reap the\nadvantages of competitiveness.\nIn this context, the very important forums held\nduring the past year, which sought to advance the\ndevelopment agenda, were both timely and welcome.\nAt Doha last November, there was some\nacknowledgement of the wide differences in levels of\ndevelopment and capacity of States, and the\nconsequential need for special and differential\ntreatment for developing countries. We look forward to\nhaving these principles incorporated into the\narchitecture of World Trade Organization rules. This,\nfor us, would be an important step in pursuing a\ndevelopment dimension within the trade agenda. Since\ntrade is the engine of development, it is vital that real\nopportunities be made available in export markets for\ndeveloping country products, without the barriers, in\nvarious forms, which continue to hamper market access\nand restrict the expansion of exports.\nThere should also be significant strengthening of\nproductive capacity through new investment and\ncapital transfers to developing countries. At Monterrey\nin March, we sought to put in place a framework for\nthe more effective mobilization of resources for\ndevelopment from many critical sources. Some\nindications were given of ODA increases, which we\nwelcome, although these still fall below the agreed\ntargets. In the absence of a system of global\ngovernance that would assure equity in investment\nopportunity and protection from the volatility of\nprivate financial flows, official sources of finance\nremain a critical form of development assistance. It is,\ntherefore, important that these new resources are made\navailable to achieve concrete results without the\ncomplications of conditionalities and selective\nprocessing.\nAs we pursue implementation of the Monterrey\nConsensus and the Doha Agenda, we also look forward\nto progress in the democratization of the decision-\nmaking process within the international system for\nfinance and trade. For it is only when developing\ncountries are accorded fair space and an effective voice\nin the setting of international finance and trade policies\nthat we will begin to see greater equity in the\ndistribution of the world's wealth.\nMost recently, in Johannesburg, we embraced a\nnew opportunity to advance the sustainable\ndevelopment agenda by furthering progress in the\nimplementation of Agenda 21. We welcome the\nimportant new targets agreed, which give fuller\nexpression to the commitment of the international\ncommunity to the Millennium Development Goals. The\nreal test will be to see whether the commitments are\ntranslated into action, through the mobilization of\nresources, to meet the requirements of the programme\nand the targets that have been set. Johannesburg is thus\nthe climax of an important year that reshaped and\nrefocused the development priorities of the global\ncommunity for the new millennium. For sustainable\ndevelopment will not be achieved without financing for\ndevelopment, nor without a development agenda in\ntrade. Jamaica welcomes in particular the commitments\nmade at Johannesburg in respect of small island\ndeveloping States (SIDS). We continue to underscore\nthe need for special attention to be paid to the\nchallenges of vulnerability faced by SIDS. What is\nneeded is a fair opportunity to secure the welfare of our\npeople, and to protect our fragile environment.\nThis cannot be achieved without the full support\nof the international community. The Barbados\nProgramme of Action, adopted in 1994, represented\nthat commitment of support. As we now prepare to\nreview its implementation in 2004, we encourage\n33\n\nrenewed engagement on those issues critical to our\nvery survival, such as the dangers posed by global\nwarming, sea level rise and natural disasters.\nJamaica welcomes the positive indications for\nAfrica, where the reduction of political conflict and\nturmoil offers a real opportunity for building stability\nand economic progress. Africa has suffered for far too\nlong from a myriad of difficult problems and should be\ngiven a new start.\nThe formation of the African Union and the\ninauguration of the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment (NEPAD) are commendable initiatives\naimed at bringing Africa closer to the mainstream of\ninternational development, at containing the HIV/AIDS\npandemic and at combating the spread of poverty. What\nare really needed now are resources and we urge that\nevery effort be made to ensure that the new initiatives\nachieve a breakthrough for African development.\nIn the field of social development and human\nrights, the United Nations has made significant\nachievements in extending and promoting the rights of\npersons in vulnerable and disadvantaged groups.\nNotwithstanding those achievements, the Organization\nis faced with growing social challenges, including the\nHIV/AIDS pandemic, which threaten to reverse\ndecades of progress in many parts of the world.\nConcerted action to control the spread of this disease\nshould remain a priority of the Organization. So too\nshould be the protection of the rights of children. The\nspecific time-bound targets adopted during the special\nsession on children require our unequivocal\ncommitment.\nOne of the important areas of contribution on the\npart of the United Nations is in the development of\ninternational law as a means of promoting universally\naccepted rules and the creation of multilateral legal\nregimes to achieve common goals. The most recent\nachievement is the Rome Statute on the International\nCriminal Court (ICC), which came into force in July\n2002.\nAnother outstanding example is the United\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This year,\nthe international community will be observing the 20th\nAnniversary of its signing, which took place at\nMontego Bay, Jamaica on 10 December 1982. The\nimmense significance of this Convention in\nsafeguarding the interests of all countries, in the\nexploitation of ocean resources, and in maritime issues\nhas been widely acknowledged.\nWe applaud the work being carried out by the two\ninstitutions that have evolved out of the Convention \u2014\nthe International Seabed Authority (ISA), which is\nentrusted with the implementation of the concept of the\ncommon heritage of mankind, and the International\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea, which is the forum for\nresolving maritime disputes under the Convention.\nThis is a good example of the result of working\ntogether to achieve common solutions through a\nmultilateral process to advance the common interest. It\nshows that the United Nations is working. We should\nsafeguard and strengthen it as the guardian of our\ncommon future."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like, on\nbehalf of the Government and the people of Thailand,\nto extend my heartfelt congratulations to you, Sir, upon\nyour election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-seventh session. I am confident\nthat, under your able leadership and guidance, this\nsession will build upon the momentum and efforts of\nprevious endeavours and reach a fruitful conclusion.\nI also wish to commend your predecessor, Mr.\nHan Seung-soo, whose tireless efforts guided us\nthrough the past eventful year.\nWe look forward to welcoming the Democratic\nRepublic of Timor-Leste to the United Nations.\nThailand is honoured to have actively participated in\nthe United Nations operations in East Timor from the\nvery beginning. Thailand's role in East Timor was\nunique in linking the peacekeeping mission to\ndevelopment and poverty eradication.\nI would also like to congratulate Switzerland on\nbecoming a new Member of the family of this world\nbody. Switzerland is hardly a stranger to the United\nNations system; its support has been long standing. I\nam certain that the two new Members will further\ncontribute to the universality and the work of the\nUnited Nations.\nAs we remember, one year on, the horrendous\nterrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, we share the\ngrief and painful awareness of the impact of that\nheinous crime on global security and stability. One year\non, we are still witnessing the development of\nconflicts, threats of terrorism and the challenge of how\nto deal with errant members of the international\ncommunity. Indeed, the post-11-September world must\nrely much more on the role of the multilateral\nmechanism to promote peace, security and prosperity\nin the international community. More than ever before,\ntoday's terrorism continues to be a threat to human\nsecurity and global economic stability.\nAs the Secretary-General so rightly said, that\ntragic incident and its repercussions required a broad,\nsustained and global response. Thailand fully endorses\nhis call for the international community to use\nmultilateral institutions effectively to respond to the\nglobal scourge of terrorism. Thailand condemns\nterrorism and supports all United Nations actions\nagainst it. Moreover, the Thai Government is\ndetermined to push ahead with the necessary steps, in\nterms of its domestic legislation and regulations, so as\nto enable Thailand to become a party to all the\ninternational conventions relating to terrorism. We are\nworking closely with the Counter-Terrorism Committee\nto implement Security Council resolution 1373 (2001).\nThere is to date no indication whatsoever that there is\nany trace of terrorist capability in Thailand. We are\nmaking sure that no terrorist activities or networks can\nbe harboured in our territory.\nThe Association of South-East Asian Nations and\nUnited States Joint Declaration for Cooperation to\nCombat International Terrorism also demonstrates our\ncommon and regional resolve to fight terrorism.\nObviously we cannot take peace for granted. The\nuncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons\nand the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other\nweapons of mass destruction are growing threats to\nworld peace and security. The indispensable role of the\nUnited Nations in maintaining international peace and\nsecurity must gain support from every member of the\ncommunity.\nIn order to prevent the proliferation of weapons\nof mass destruction and pave the way for their\nreduction and eventual elimination, the multilateral\nsecurity system must be effectively complied with. In\nthis regard, we urge Iraq to comply with the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions unconditionally and\nunreservedly, in accordance with its responsibilities. At\nthe same time, we are also convinced that diplomatic\nefforts, undertaken within the United Nations\nframework, are desirable and will be the most effective\nmeans of reaching a favourable solution and so\npreventing the escalation of this crisis. Therefore,\nwhile we view as a positive development yesterday's\nletter to the Secretary-General, undertaking to allow\nUnited Nations weapons inspectors back into Iraq, we,\ntogether with other nations, expect Iraq fully to live up\nto the solemn undertaking that it has given to the world\nbody.\nWhile effective multilateral mechanisms are the\nkey to the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity, it is also the responsibility of each and every\nmember of the international community to bring about\nand uphold peace. It is also the responsibility of each\nand every State to ensure that peace, once restored, will\nlast.\nIn this regard, Thailand is honoured to be hosting\nthe current peace negotiations between the Government\nof Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,\n19\n\nbeing held from 16 to 18 September. We hope to\nfacilitate the peace talks with a view to bringing a\nlasting solution to this longstanding conflict and to\nending the suffering that has resulted.\nAs part of the reconstruction efforts in\nAfghanistan, Thailand has pledged to share its\nexperience and knowledge in the reduction of opium\ncultivation through the crop substitution programme\nunder the renowned project sponsored by His Majesty\nthe King. That is part of the global effort to sustain\npeace in Afghanistan, as the scourge of drugs threatens\npeace and stability.\nThe current Thai Government, under the\nleadership of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, is\ndetermined to see the Thai people enjoy the benefits of\nfreedom from fear and want. Human security has\ntherefore been declared one of the Government's most\nimportant policies. Thailand believes that we will be\none of the first countries in the world to set up a\nministry of human security for that specific purpose.\nThe ministry is due to be inaugurated next month.\nThailand is also proud to be one of the 13 members of\nthe Human Security Network, whose work is well\nunder way.\nThe scourge of drugs deprives our people of both\nfreedom from fear and freedom from want, and poverty\nremains a major threat to human security. Since taking\nup office early last year, the current Thai Government\nhas waged war against drugs and poverty with the\nresolute determination to win. We are not doing it\nalone. Our partnerships to tackle the global threat of\ndrugs  partnerships formed within bilateral, regional\nand international cooperative frameworks, such as the\nUnited Nations International Drug Control\nProgramme  have been fruitful. An initiative of\nThailand, the quadrilateral cooperation among China,\nLaos, Myanmar and Thailand to prevent and suppress\nthe production and trafficking of drugs is making\nprogress, particularly in combating the spread of\nmethamphetamines. The leaders of our four countries\nwill meet at an appropriate time to provide much-\nneeded political impetus at the highest level.\nThe issue of HIV/AIDS is another major\ntransnational threat to human security. Thailand has\nforged partnerships with its neighbouring countries,\nparticularly the greater Mekong subregion, as well as a\npartnership with related United Nations agencies and\nwith the members of the Human Security Network to\ntackle this global epidemic. At the XV International\nConference on AIDS, to be hosted by Thailand in\n2004, we hope to share our experiences in addressing\nthe multifaceted aspects of HIV/AIDS, namely,\nprevention, treatment, care and support, as well as\nresearch and development.\nEven if the war against poverty is Thailand's\nmajor priority, the eradication of poverty is not any\ncountry's exclusive agenda. Rather, it is an agenda for\nall mankind. The United Nations millennium\ndevelopment goals have rightly placed the interests and\nwelfare of the people at the core of socio-economic\ndevelopment. Since their adoption, several events\nunder the United Nations framework have taken place\nto ensure sustainable development.\nOur children must inherit the world in at least no\nworse a shape than it is in today, if not a better and\nmore livable one.\nFrom Brussels to Doha and Monterrey to\nJohannesburg, the resolve and commitment of the\ninternational community to advance towards achieving\nthe millennium development goals for sustainable\ndevelopment have been clearly mobilized. The\nMonterrey consensus has provided a road map for\nfostering more effective partnership and greater policy\ncoherence amongst Governments and financial and\ntrade institutions. The international trade and financial\nenvironment must be developed to better serve\nsustainable development.\nGreater market access for developing countries'\nexports forms part and parcel of making the Doha\nround a truly development round. The G8's decision to\nresist protectionist pressure is a positive step forward.\nEqually important is the role of foreign direct\ninvestment, which requires rechannelling in order not\nonly to meet the development goals of the host country,\nbut also to promote investors' corporate accountability\nand social responsibility.\nThe World Summit on Sustainable Development\nin Johannesburg was, indeed, a historic event. Thailand\ngladly welcomes the adoption of the Political\nDeclaration and the Plan of Implementation,\nparticularly their emphasis on poverty reduction, which\nbinds the three pillars of sustainable development. The\nSummit underscored a range of principles, such as self-\nhelp and common but differentiated responsibilities, to\nmake sustainable development a reality for mankind.\nEnhanced coordination and coherence amongst\n20\n\nGovernments, international organizations and other\nstakeholders are crucial to providing the necessary\nsynergies in achieving our common goals.\nThe principle of partnership as enunciated at\nMonterrey and echoed at the World Summit on\nSustainable Development is being implemented.\nThailand is proud to be cited as one of the concrete\nexamples of countries that have succeeded in their\ncoordination and partnership efforts in capacity-\nbuilding. As a result of the tenth session of the United\nNations Conference on Trade and Development\n(UNCTAD), held in Thailand in 2000, the International\nInstitute for Trade and Development (ITD) has been\nestablished in Bangkok. ITD is a Thailand-UNCTAD\npartnership to enhance the productive capacity and\ntrade-negotiating skills of developing countries as they\nprepare for the new round of global trade negotiations.\nCapacity-building is crucial if developing\ncountries are to participate effectively in defending and\nadvancing their interests both in bilateral and\nmultilateral free-trade arrangements, where,\nincreasingly, non-tariff barriers are often found in the\nguise of environmental measures. In this aspect, ITD\ncan serve as a useful linkage between UNCTAD, the\nWorld Trade Organization and the United Nations\nEnvironment Programme for capacity-building in trade\nnegotiation. Thailand urges Member States to consider\nthe best use of this Thailand-UNCTAD Institute.\nAs an item on the world agenda, poverty\neradication can never succeed unless there are genuine\nefforts at the neighbour, regional and global levels. The\nMekong subregion is another example of self-help and\npartnership among developing countries. The road map\nfor opportunities to advance economic integration in\nthat subregion is now taking shape. The commercial\nroutes  the routes of economic opportunities\nproviding transportation linkages  are being\nestablished with the partnership of donor countries and\nthe Asian Development Bank. From East to West \nfrom Viet Nam, Laos and Thailand to Myanmar and\nIndia  and from North to South  from southern\nChina, Myanmar and Laos to Thailand  these road\nlinkages are now the new lifelines for the future\nprosperity of the region. They will bring about access\nto markets, capital and knowledge for sustainable\ndevelopment.\nBased on the same principle of creating\nopportunities in the region for economic progress,\nPrime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra took the initiative,\nwith the support and participation of 18 Asian nations,\nto turn Asia's rich diversity into collective strength by\ncreating synergy from an Asia-wide partnership known\nas the Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD). Launched in\nJune this year, with its original members ranging from\nthe West to the North-East of the Asian continent and\nwith its core principles of positive thinking, ACD is\nenvisaged as an evolving, informal, non-\ninstitutionalized, open, inclusive and incremental\nprocess.\nACD's strength is to build upon multiple layers of\nstrategic partnerships in practical areas of cooperation,\nsuch as the development of small and medium-sized\nenterprises, tourism, transportation linkages,\nagriculture and poverty eradication. We hope that ACD\nwill help enhance Asia's economic competitiveness,\nopen up business opportunities and make Asia a\nstronger partner for both our developed and developing\npartners. After the success of its inaugural ministerial\nmeeting in Cha-Am, Thailand, in June, Thailand will\nbe host once more to the ACD meeting next year to\nmove our cooperation forward.\nInternational and regional partnerships, as well as\ncommitments to sustainable development, are not\nenough. They must be reinforced by partnerships and\npolicies at the national level. The goals and methods\ncontained in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation\nare being pursued as part of our development strategy.\nThe present Thai Government is pursuing a\ndevelopment strategy of enhancing international\ncompetitiveness and domestic productivity through\nmobilizing both domestic and external sources of\ngrowth for balanced and sustainable development.\nThis balanced development strategy has been\ninspired by His Majesty the King of Thailand's\nphilosophy of sufficiency economy'. The main\nprinciple of this approach to development is adherence\nto a middle path at the level of the individual, families\nand communities. This involves strengthening the\ngrass-roots economy to build its immunity against the\nadverse impact of global volatility, as well as to\nenhance its ability to benefit from the multilateral\ntrading system.\nThailand places people at the forefront of its\ndevelopment efforts. Their livelihood must entail\nhuman development and community participation. This\nGovernment is making progress in its programmes and\n21\n\nmeasures to improve the quality of life of the Thai\npeople. They include the provision of health care for\nall, a three-year debt suspension for farmers, the\nestablishment of microcredit facilities, such as the\nPeople's Bank, for small entrepreneurs, and the\nlaunching of a village and urban revolving fund to\nprovide financial support for local initiatives. In\nenhancing human potential and innovation, 12 years of\nfree education for all are guaranteed by our\nConstitution. This goes along well with the recent\nrecommendation by the G8 Education Task Force on\neducation in developing countries.\nAs a result of lessons learned from past history,\nthe Charter of the United Nations prescribes the\nmultilateral structure of this institution as the best\nmeans to maintain international peace and security as\nwell as to advance social and economic development\nand prosperity. It remains the tasks and duties of this\ninstitution and its Member States to continue\nperforming to achieve the Charter objectives. Peace,\nhowever, cannot be enforced, but must be cultivated\nthrough tolerance and respect for each other.\nProsperity, on the other hand, cannot be obtained\nwithout creating opportunities from the diverse\nstrengths of each other. Those tasks and duties,\ntherefore, do not merely involve the compliance by\neach Member State with the United Nations\nmultilateral mechanism; they also include our forging\ncooperation and partnership at all levels among all\nstakeholders. For its part, Thailand remains firmly\ncommitted to achieving global peace and prosperity by\nworking with other States regionally and universally\nwithin the United Nations framework. We have faith\nthat, ultimately, through this multilateral institution we\nshall build the world best suited for us and our children\nto live peacefully and harmoniously.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, I wish to express my thanks to the\nAssembly for having come to hear Paraguay's position.\nSecondly, I must apologize if I am interrupting your\nluncheon.\nLet me begin my statement in this general debate\nby expressing my delegation's gratification at seeing\nyou, Sir, preside over the work of this Assembly. Your\npersonal and professional qualities will guarantee that\nour work is successful, and you may rely on the\nconstant and resolute support of the Paraguayan\ndelegation. We also wish to take this opportunity to\nexpress our thanks to Secretary-General Kofi Annan\nfor the report that he has presented on the work of our\nOrganization, which confirms how essential this work\nis in the context of today's world. There is a need for\nall States members not simply to support that work, but\nalso to make it even stronger and more flexible in\nresponding to fresh challenges.\nAllow me also to welcome and express my\ncountry's satisfaction at seeing the accession to this\nOrganization of the Swiss Confederation, as well as the\nupcoming addition of Timor-Leste. With these new\nMembers we take an important step forward towards\nachieving the universality to which the Organization\naspires.\nThe events of the last year, some auspicious,\nothers discouraging, have given us resounding proof of\nthe role of the United Nations and the fact that the\nOrganization's reform is now, more than ever before, a\npressing and urgent challenge. I am thinking of the\nneed for a thorough reform of its organs and structure,\nas well as of its functions, and of changes that would\nequip this Organization to respond more effectively to\nthe fresh challenges that are emerging with unexpected\nspeed on the international scene.\nWho would have thought, when this Organization\nwas founded more than 50 years ago, that at this\ncurrent General Assembly session we would be\nextending a welcome in the United Nations to two new\nMember States: Switzerland, a State that has always\nheld its place and played its role in history and on the\ninternational scene; and Timor-Leste, whose birth we\nwitnessed just a few months ago, thanks to a large\nextent to United Nations intervention? Nor could we\nhave imagined just a few decades ago that this year we\nwould have witnessed one of the most important and\n2\n\nanticipated events in the area of human rights  that\nis, the establishment of the International Criminal\nCourt. Who would have thought that one year ago, on\n11 September 2001, we would have been eyewitnesses\nto one of the most tragic and incomprehensible events\nin history  the history not only of the United States\nof America, but also of the whole of humankind  and\nthat immediately thereafter the international\ncommunity would unite and respond most decisively in\ncombating international terrorism?\nThose events show us that today's world is not\nthe same as that of the Organization's founders. Among\nother reasons, they determine and require reform of our\ninstitution. That is why it is necessary that we give\npriority to the work of the United Nations, not only so\nthat the Organization responds efficiently to political\nevents, but also to ensure sustainable development so\nthat its benefits reach every individual, wherever he\nmay live, work and have a home.\nUndoubtedly, a renewed and reorganized United\nNations will ultimately respond to the well-being of\nevery one of our citizens. The decisions that we take in\nthat regard over the next months will define and guide\nour countries and humanity in the future. Thus we\ncannot limit ourselves to superficial or simply\nprocedural actions; we must achieve a genuine\ntransformation.\nIn that regard, we must reaffirm first of all the\ncentral role to be played by the General Assembly as\nthe principal organ of the United Nations, since it is the\nmost representative, democratic, universal and\nequitable deliberating organ. The Assembly should\nbecome the world's parliament, in which all\ncountries  regardless of their size or position  can\nexpound, debate, dissent, express their views and share\npositions on the most important current issues. It\ncannot continue to be the arena where we come to\nparticipate merely to carry out a routine function based\non a pre-established and repetitive agenda, and in\nwhich our statements are mere rhetoric that is scarcely\nlistened to by any other delegation. Therefore, we\nfirmly support the process of revitalizing the Assembly,\nwhich should continue and should focus in that\ndirection. The changes must be genuine and profound\nso as to enhance the Assembly's effectiveness and\nefficiency.\nNo reform of the United Nations will have the\neffect that we all wish for without the much-awaited\nreform of the Security Council. Until that body \nresponsible for maintaining international peace and\nsecurity  is reformed, we will not be able to speak of\nan Organization that is in accord with the time in which\nwe live. That is why we should expand both categories\nof members  permanent and non-permanent  and\ninclude both developed and developing countries,\ntaking into particular account that the latter are\ncurrently under-represented in such an important body.\nAt the same time, reform should include the gradual\nabolition of the right of veto for permanent members\nuntil it disappears, making the Council fairer and more\ndemocratic. We believe that the time has come to\nassume our political responsibility in the settlement of\nthis matter.\nOne year after the tragic events of 11 September,\nwe need to ask ourselves what implications they have\nhad, as much for this Organization as for each country\ndomestically. Paraguay took a firm position of\ncondemning international terrorism, fully\nimplementing the measures imposed by the Security\nCouncil and promoting the validity of the numerous\nrelevant international agreements. My Government\nresponded to the requirements of Security Council\nresolution 1373 (2001), and to date it has presented two\nreports to the Committee established pursuant to that\nresolution. I here reaffirm our commitment to continue\nto cooperate with the Committee in its efforts, as we\nhave been doing on the regional and subregional levels.\nMoreover, I should like to report that Paraguay, in\nkeeping with its constitutional process, is becoming a\nparty to the 12 international agreements on terrorism\nand was one of the first countries to sign the Inter-\nAmerican Convention against Terrorism, adopted in the\nframework of the Organization of American States.\nWe firmly support the strengthening of an\ninternational legal basis for combating terrorism. That\nis why we hope that during this session of the General\nAssembly, negotiations on the comprehensive\ninternational convention against terrorism  a\nproposal presented by India  will be concluded, as\nwell as the Russian Federation's proposal for an\ninternational convention for the suppression of acts of\nnuclear terrorism.\nOne achievement of far-reaching importance this\nyear was the entry into force of the Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court on 1 July, and we are\ngratified to be one of the first 66 countries whose\nratification of the Rome Statute made this possible. We\n3\n\nare convinced that the Court will be a deterrent to\nunacceptable human rights abuses and crimes against\nhumanity. Likewise, we are certain that the work of the\nCourt will not be tarnished or manipulated by any\npolitical influence and that its independence,\nimpartiality and purpose will be preserved. Paraguay\nappeals to all countries that have not yet signed or\nratified the Statute to do so as soon as possible, since\nthe Court's universality is fundamental to its\neffectiveness. My country has followed very closely\nthe recent debate on the Court's competence to judge\nhypothetical offences, committed in the course of\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations, in which\npersonnel in the service of countries that have not\nsigned or ratified the Statute might be involved.\nWe welcome the Secretary-General's appointment\nof the new High Commissioner for Human Rights. We\nare certain that, as a Latin American, he will do honour\nto that appointment, which was confirmed by the\nAssembly. We share his desire to build a human rights\nagenda that will not divide peoples and States, but\nrather unite them more. Paraguay will provide all the\nsupport necessary to ensure that his mission is\nsuccessful.\nFor the first time, Paraguay will become a\nmember of the United Nations Commission on Human\nRights, as of January 2003, and I should like to take\nthis opportunity to reaffirm my Government's\ncommitment to cooperate with and contribute to that\nbody's important and altruistic work. We are prepared\nto work with the other members of the Commission as\nwell as with other States and entities.\nToday we face a complex world that is still far\nfrom forming a stable international order. We continue\nto witness confrontations in various regions of the\nworld. That is why we must devote all our efforts and\nresources to the reconciliation of humanity. The\nRepublic of Paraguay will always invoke and support\nthe peaceful settlement of conflicts through dialogue,\nmutual understanding and international law.\nIn that regard, we see grounds for grave concern\nin the serious worsening of the situation in the Middle\nEast: the spiral of violence, the alarming humanitarian\nsituation and the violation of the fundamental rights of\nthe civilian population as well as the loss of innocent\nlives among both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples.\nWe resolutely support the work of the `quartet'\nand of the international community in general in their\nefforts to secure a resumption of negotiations and thus\nbring about much-desired peace in the region. At the\nsame time, as a country that abides strictly by\ninternational law, Paraguay regrets the fact that the\nresolutions adopted by the Security Council on this\nquestion this year, which contain clear terms and\nreferences, have still not been implemented by the\nparties.\nParaguay would underscore once again the urgent\nneed to achieve a just and lasting peace in the Middle\nEast on the basis of Security Council resolutions,\nespecially 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 1397 (2002), in\norder to pave the way for the peaceful coexistence of\ntwo independent States, Israel and Palestine, within\nsecure and internationally recognized borders.\nMy country, Paraguay, has been following closely\nthe situation in Afghanistan. We welcome the presence\nin this general debate of President Karzai, who\ndeserves our recognition and our firm support in his\nefforts to fulfil his responsibilities and to carry out the\ntasks that lie ahead of him. The international\ncommunity is committed to continuing to support\nAfghanistan so as to enable it to achieve the stability\nand development that its people so desire.\nThe Government of Paraguay, in keeping with the\nposition it has been maintaining and expressing\nconcerning the question of the Republic of China on\nTaiwan, would once again reaffirm its strong wish that\nthis issue be considered within the framework of\nuniversality embodied in our Charter and on the basis\nof norms of international law, in order to achieve a\nsatisfactory solution through dialogue among the\nparties concerned.\nThis year has been marked by important\nconferences. The World Assembly on Ageing in\nMadrid, the special session on children, the Monterrey\nConference, the Johannesburg Summit and the World\nFood Summit took place in a context of increasing\ndeterioration in the socio-economic conditions\naffecting many of our peoples, thus heightening\nfrustration and despair because of the lack of tangible\nand concrete results. In order to prevent the situation\nfrom persisting, what is needed on the one hand is\nurgent political resolve on the part of all Member\nStates to implement and fulfil the commitments\nundertaken at those conferences and, on the other hand,\nan increase in the participation and integration of\ndeveloping countries in the process of global political\ndecision-making.\n4\n\nConsequently, Paraguay has been striving to\nchannel the limited resources at its disposal into areas\nof pressing priority in the social and economic fields,\nparticularly in the areas of education and health, to the\npoint where now they represent a majority of\nParaguay's national budget. We have also reduced\nmilitary expenditure to below 1 per cent of gross\ndomestic product, the lowest level in our history. We\nhave also been giving priority to State expenditure\ndirected at building road and energy infrastructure,\nwhich will make it possible to integrate Paraguay into\nthe transport and energy corridors that will link the\nAtlantic and Pacific oceans in South America.\nSustainable development in its broadest\ndefinition, as we addressed it at Johannesburg,\nincreasingly requires shared solutions in a globalized\nworld as well as differentiated commitments. For this\nreason, we deem it essential that the industrialized\ncountries share in and support our development plans.\nOfficial development assistance should play only a\ncomplementary role that will enable us to incorporate,\nin a timely manner, the available financial resources \nfrom both internal and external sources  so as to\nenable smaller countries to be properly incorporated\ninto a competitive and independent world.\nOne of the instruments that is constantly touted as\na producer of development is free trade. The\ndeveloping countries want to see free trade on a double\ntrack. We want to have access to the markets of the\ndeveloped countries, and we wish to see the\nelimination of measures that distort trade, such as\nagricultural subsidies, domestic export assistance and\nthe abuse of anti-dumping measures.\nIf these protectionist practices persist, they will\ndelay our countries' participation in the supposed\nbenefits that, we believe, stem from free trade and will\nalso considerably worsen the social divide in all its\nmanifestations. Combating poverty is not just a\npolitical commitment but, above all, a moral one.\nParaguay welcomes the General Assembly's plan\nto devote a day  16 September  to considering\nways and means of providing support to the New\nPartnership for Africa's Development. High-level\nplenary sessions and interactive round tables will be\nheld. We trust that the outcome will make a decisive\ncontribution to promoting renewed commitments to the\nsocial and economic development of the whole of the\nAfrican continent.\nThe International Ministerial Meeting of\nLandlocked Developing Countries and Transit\nDeveloping Countries will be held next year. It will\naddress the problems that beset countries such as my\nown, such as integration into international markets,\nexcessive costs related to transit transport, customs\ndelays, restrictions and technical barriers to trade, as\nwell as the need for financial support and the requisite\ninvestment in infrastructure and capacity development\nin order to overcome the disadvantages that stem from\nbeing landlocked.\nParaguay has offered to host the subregional\nLatin American preparatory meeting for the Ministerial\nMeeting, with a view to defining clearly all of the\nnecessary measures to establish our country's\nrequirements, in particular with respect to the\ndifferential treatment to be given to landlocked\ncountries, through tangible commitments in the areas\nof transport, customs and duty-free zones and in the\narea of opening markets through reduced customs\ntariffs, the elimination of special excise duties and\nother measures that hinder the competitive\nparticipation in international trade of landlocked\ndeveloping countries.\nParaguay, in the context of its democratization\nprocess, to which all citizens are committed at the\nState, regional and municipal levels, will be holding\nelections in April next year, which will once again\nconfirm the consolidation of our democracy.\nUnfortunately, as in many other countries of the world,\nand especially in Latin America today, the democratic\nsystem is threatened by heightened poverty and the\nserious economic situation, which has caused the living\nconditions of our citizens to deteriorate. For that\nreason, our country must also receive the consideration\nthat it deserves in the context of efforts to find\nsolutions to these problems.\nI trust that the Organization and the financial\nagencies and their principal members will respond\nappropriately at the right time.\nIn concluding my last address to this plenary as\nhead of State of the Republic of Paraguay, my term\nof office, according to the Constitution, ends on 15\nAugust 2003, I wish to reaffirm my country's\ncommitment to this Organization and its trust that it, in\nturn, will respond to the hopes and expectations of a\nbetter future for our peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, allow\nme to sincerely congratulate Mr. Kavan on his election\nto the position of President of the fifty-seventh session\nof the General Assembly. I am confident that under his\nable leadership the work of the Assembly will be\nconducted in a most productive manner. I would also\nlike to use this opportunity to thank the outgoing\nPresident, Mr. Han Seung-soo, for the successful\ncompletion of the work of the fifty-sixth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I would also like to use this\nopportunity to warmly congratulate Switzerland on\nbecoming a full member of the United Nations family\nand to welcome the return of the United States to the\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization.\nFollowing the horrific terrorist attacks of 11\nSeptember last year, there have emerged a new vigour\nand resolve to make our world a safer place for all, not\nonly in promises but in deeds.\nGeneral Assembly and Security Council\nresolutions, especially Security Council resolution\n1373 (2001), serve as a common platform for\ncombating terrorism. However, their letter and spirit\nmust be fully and thoroughly implemented in order to\nrid ourselves of global terrorist threats. In our\nendeavours, the United Nations is proving to be the\nbest framework and unique pillar for the international\ncommunity's joint actions in maintaining international\npeace and security, as well as in providing legitimacy\nto these actions.\n13\n\nThe prompt and almost universal response of\nMember States to the requests of the Security Council's\nCounter-Terrorism Committee is a telling example of\nhow efficient the United Nations can be in mobilizing\nthe international community in facing common\nchallenges. It is our hope that Member States will\nrespond with the same sense of responsibility in\nanother important aspect of eradicating terrorism: to\nfinalize current negotiations on the comprehensive\nconvention on combating international terrorism.\nFurthermore, Croatia believes that efforts should\nbe intensified to resolve regional conflicts that offer\nfertile ground for recruiting terrorists. The cycle of\nviolence in the Middle East must end. Parties to the\nconflict must return to the negotiating table and make a\nreality of the vision of two peoples living in peace\nwithin secure and recognized State borders.\nWe also call for Iraq's full compliance with its\ninternational obligations regarding the possession and\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nViolations of Security Council resolutions must not be\ntolerated, and we welcome the decision by President\nBush to work with the United Nations Security Council\nin this regard.\nWe must also recognize that today Afghanistan is\non a difficult yet hopeful road to recovery with the\nassistance of the international community.\nWe fully support the Secretary-General in his\nefforts to move the United Nations from a culture of\nreaction to one of prevention. We consider that the\ntimely dispatch of well-structured peacekeeping\noperations with a clear and effective mandate can\nprevent the recurrence of conflicts and create a\nplatform for rebuilding peace and shattered societies. It\nis exactly here that new tasks and challenges lie for\ncontemporary peacekeeping operations, whose birth we\nhave witnessed in East Timor and Kosovo. In this\nregard, we welcome the Security Council's new\napproach of having regular meetings with troop-\ncontributing countries. As a contributor of military\nobservers in peacekeeping missions in Sierra Leone,\nEthiopia and Eritrea and recently in Kashmir, Croatia\nhas found that exchange of information and experience\nmost fruitful and useful for all.\nThat brings me to the subject of Security Council\nreform, which, as all of us agree, is necessary to\naddress the new political environment of the twenty-\nfirst century. Unfortunately, we have still not achieved\nsufficient political consensus for significant progress in\nthis respect. The lack of progress is certainly\ndiscouraging for many. Nevertheless, we must reform\nthe Council in order to be able to adequately address\nthe security threats we are facing today.\nAs we revisit the historic promises made by our\nworld leaders, enshrined in the Millennium\nDeclaration, we must now embark on a process of\nimproving the United Nations as an instrument of\nglobal co-operation for the benefit of all humankind. In\nthis regard, we commend the Secretary-General for his\nreport on the integrated and coordinated\nimplementation of, and follow-up to, the outcome of\nthe major United Nations conferences and summits, as\na necessary prerequisite to implementing the goals set\nin the Millennium Declaration. To that end, the full and\nconstant co-operation of Member States and the\nSecretariat is essential.\nThe Economic and Social Council has continued\non the path of strengthening its role within the United\nNations system. A number of innovative precedents\nhave been set this year related to the improvement of\ncooperation and coordination among many bodies of\nthe United Nations and between the Economic and\nSocial Council and the International Monetary Fund\nand the World Bank, and to the Council's cooperation\nwith non-governmental organizations and the private\nsector. The resolution concerning the Ad Hoc Advisory\nGroup on African Countries emerging from conflicts\nwas adopted to help such countries in their peace-\nbuilding processes. Guinea-Bissau has already\nsubmitted an official request for the establishment of\nsuch an Ad Hoc Advisory Group for its own country.\nCroatia is pleased that it can contribute, through the\nPresident of the Economic and Social Council, to the\nrevival and strengthening of that highly important\nbody.\nThe United Nations should continue to keep\ndevelopment at the forefront of all areas on the\nOrganization's substantive agenda. Among all\nmultilateral organizations, the United Nations is the\nonly one with the institutional capability to address and\nmanage the challenges of globalization. The Croatian\ndelegation hopes that the outcome and follow-up of the\nconferences held at Monterrey and Johannesburg will\nkeep our commitment on track, in particular with\nregard to mobilizing additional financial resources. We\n14\n\nmust work together to improve the lives of people in\npoverty and to reverse the continuing degradation of\nthe global environment. A truly global mobilization of\nall relevant stakeholders will be necessary to ensure\nthat the outcomes of those conferences are transformed\ninto reality.\nWe note the broader acceptance by Member\nStates of United Nations norms, which will ultimately\nlead to the globalization of human rights and to a\nuniversally recognized international code of human\nrights. As Governments, we must provide the\nenvironment for the universal acceptance and full\nimplementation of such rights. Croatia is contributing\nto that goal through its membership in the United\nNations Commission on Human Rights.\nGlobal contributions comprise individual\nachievements. In order to contribute to global peace,\nsecurity and development, each country must be stable\nand secure and must function on a well-founded\neconomic system. My Government is doing exactly\nthat. In October last year, Croatia signed the\nStabilization and Association Agreement with the\nEuropean Union. Over the past two years, we have\nintroduced a set of reforms aimed at bringing Croatian\nsociety closer to the European Union and to the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization. The commitment of the\nCroatian Government in that respect was recognized by\nthe European Commission. In its first report on the\nstabilization and association process, issued this past\nspring, Croatia was singled out as the country most\nadvanced in the process.\nAnother important element in that regard is\nregional cooperation, in which Croatia plays a very\nactive role. The outstanding issues that may reflect on\nthe region's stability, such as the return of refugees, are\nhigh on my Government's priority list. Therefore,\nCroatia has adopted an action plan for the voluntary\nreturn of refugees through the end of the next year.\nWe have significantly improved bilateral relations\nwith the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and will\ncontinue to do so. In the light of the discussion\nbetween the two delegations held just a few days ago, I\nbelieve that the remaining open issues will be\nsuccessfully resolved in the near future. One of those\nissues is the identification and delimitation of the land\nand sea border in the area of Prevlaka. Intensive\nnegotiations are under way, and we believe that some\nform of temporary solution may be reached soon. In\nany event, the situation concerning Prevlaka no longer\nrepresents a threat to peace and security, and therefore\nwe believe that the United Nations Mission of\nObservers in Prevlaka has successfully accomplished\nits mandate and that, consequently, that mandate should\nnot be extended after it expires.\nWith regard to border issues, I would like to\nreport an important success: an agreement on the\nnorthern part of our border with Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. That agreement was reached through the\nvaluable efforts of the Special Representative of the\nSecretary-General in Bosnia and Herzegovina, whom\nwe sincerely thank. At this point, shortly before the end\nof the United Nations presence in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, I would like to express my Government's\nappreciation for the Organization's overall contribution\nto the stability and development of that country.\nOn the other hand, we cannot fail to express our\ndeep frustration at the continued failure to apprehend\ntwo of the most notorious war criminals to date:\nKaradzi\u0107 and Mladi\u0107. We strongly reiterate the view\nthat lasting stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina can be\nachieved only with the arrest of Karadzi\u0107 and Mladi\u0107\nand with their extradition to the appropriate authorities.\nBringing those two individuals to trial before the\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former\nYugoslavia would serve to provide closure for many\nvictims who suffered terribly. The same goes for\nSljivan\u0107anin and Radi\u0107, indicted by the Tribunal for\nwar crimes committed on Croatian territory.\nHaving faith in the maxim No peace without\njustice', my Government attaches the highest\nimportance to bringing to justice all those guilty of war\ncrimes. We are committed to maintaining the good and\nextensive cooperation that we have established with the\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former\nYugoslavia, and we urge other countries within its\nmandate to do so. However, that does not diminish the\nkey role that domestic war crimes trials play in the\nprocess of healing and national reconciliation. The\nCroatian judiciary is ready and willing to meet these\nchallenges.\nIn that spirit, the Republic of Croatia welcomed\nthe entry into force of the Rome Statute and looks\nforward to the operationalization of the International\nCriminal Court. The establishment of the first such\npermanent Court is crucial in putting an end to the\nculture of impunity and selective justice. By\n15\n\nstrengthening the universal rule of law, which in turn\nleads to the advancement of universal peace and\nsecurity, the new Court holds the promise of becoming\na true guarantor of the ideals enshrined in the Charter\nof the United Nations.\nOur fundamental and common interests in world\npeace, security and development require our concerted\nand united efforts. I am confident that this fifty-seventh\nsession of the General Assembly will take us a step\nfurther in realizing those common goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffGabon is\npleased to see Mr. Kavan presiding over the work of\nthe fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly,\nwhich is being held at a time when the need to\nstrengthen international cooperation to resolve the\nworld's problems is indeed vital. His election is a\nrecognition by the international community of the role\nthat his country, the Czech Republic, plays in the\npromotion of freedom and peace.\nTo his predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, we\nexpress our satisfaction at the excellent job he did as\nPresident of the General Assembly at the previous\nsession.\nTo Secretary-General Kofi Annan, we convey our\ngratitude and support for his forceful work on behalf of\ninternational peace and security.\nGabon welcomes the admission of the Swiss\nConfederation and the imminent accession of the\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste to membership of\nthe United Nations. They swell the ranks of our\nillustrious United Nations family, confirming its\nuniversality.\nI should like to pursue my statement by evoking\nthe metaphor of the river. Each wave lapping the banks\nhas its own character, but they all call from the same\nriver. They express multiplicity in consistency. The\nsame can be said of our annual sessions. This session is\na new wave in the mighty river of the United Nations, a\nnew cycle in the global rhythm of the world. Today,\nmany of us feel hope tinged with scepticism.\nTwo years ago, in September 2000, we held the\nMillennium Summit in this very Hall. It was certainly\nthe point of departure of a new global movement\ntowards more peace, prosperity, justice and humanism.\nAt the very moment when we imagined ourselves to\nhave taken a great step forward towards the building of\na better world for all, we were stunned on 11\nSeptember 2001 by the ghastly terrorist attacks\nperpetrated here on American soil. Those attacks of\nviolence, which we all condemned, eclipsed our\ndreams and reminded us of the beast lurking within\neach of us.\nGabon was one of the very first nations to commit\nitself to implementing the provisions of Security\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) by taking legal action\nto prevent and combat terrorism. Although significant,\nprogress made since then under the auspices of the\nSecurity Council in the campaign against international\nterrorism needs to be strengthened. That is why\n17\n\nnegotiations on a draft general convention on\ninternational terrorism must go on with a view to its\nspeedy adoption. In the same spirit, the conclusion of\nongoing discussions on a convention on the\nsuppression of acts of nuclear terrorism will\nsupplement the international anti-terrorism legal\nframework.\nThe cloud of uncertainty looming over our\ncollective security is darkened by the Israel-Palestinian\ncrisis. It is regrettable to note that renewed violence in\nthe Middle East is calling all previous efforts into\nquestion. The international community must mobilize\nto rekindle the flame of peace in that region, which has\nbeen beset by ceaseless violence for decades. Gabon\nencourages both sides to resume dialogue and\nnegotiation with a view to implementing the relevant\nresolutions of the Security Council, in particular\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which stress the\nneed for the coexistence of the Palestinian State with\nthe State of Israel, with respect for secure and\ninternationally recognized borders.\nSimilarly, Gabon hopes that the current talks\nbetween the two Koreas will help allay tensions\nbetween the two countries.\nPositive developments in the overall situation in\nAfrica attest to the continent's gradual return to the\npath of peace, stability and unity. Fratricidal conflicts\nare increasingly giving way to the emergence of an\nAfrican awareness marked by the determination to see\nthe ideals of peace prevail and to devote ourselves to\ndevelopment. This wave of hope has been justified by\nrecent developments, particularly in the Great Lakes\nregion. We are convinced that this progress will give\nimpetus to the peace process in that region.\nAccordingly, we believe that it is time to convene an\ninternational conference on the region in order to\nconsolidate peace there.\nHowever, the progress that has been made in\nresolving conflicts in Africa should not blind us to the\nsituations in Angola, Liberia, the Central African\nRepublic and Guinea-Bissau, which, having been\ndestabilized by years of conflict, are now facing\nenormous difficulties, particularly in the humanitarian\narea, in restoring domestic peace and security. The\ninternational community must lend its support to the\neconomic and social recovery efforts of those countries\nso as to prevent them from being caught up yet again in\nthe spiral of violence.\nThe world's economic and social situation is\ndisquieting. The commitments that we undertook at the\nMillennium Summit, and which were reiterated at the\nMonterrey International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, have yet to bear fruit. Globalization,\nwhich we thought would permit the harmonious\nintegration of all countries into the international\ncommunity through the process of trade liberalization,\nhas not yet attained the hoped-for results. On the\ncontrary, we see that there has been an increase in\nsocial inequality and a widening gap between\nindustrialized and developing countries.\nEfforts by developing countries, particularly in\nthe areas of consolidating democracy, the rule of law,\ngood governance, the fight against poverty and the\nrational protection and management of the\nenvironment, are still not being matched by the\ndeveloped countries, as attested to by the continued\ndiminution of external resources for development and\nthe drop in foreign investment. One must add to that\nthe growth of conditionalities and other barriers that\ncould keep those countries in a state of permanent\neconomic and social stagnation.\nAmong the elements contributing to that state of\naffairs is the heavy burden of debt. In fact, several\ndeveloping countries, including Gabon, devote almost\nhalf of their budgetary resources to repayment of debt,\nwhile at the same time they must find solutions to the\nmany problems that inhibit their development. We have\nthe firm conviction that, by reducing the indebtedness\nof our countries to a sustainable level, we can allocate\nmore resources to priorities such as universal education\nand health, housing, poverty reduction and\nenvironmental management. We hope that the promise\nmade by the World Bank and the International\nMonetary Fund to extend the current debt relief\nmechanisms to other developing countries \u2014 including\nthose with intermediate incomes, such as Gabon \u2014\nwill quickly become reality.\nIn order to respond to those concerns, Africa has\nestablished the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment (NEPAD). NEPAD is a true development\nprogramme based on good governance, respect for\nhuman rights and the strengthening of democracy,\npeace and security, which are preconditions for the\neconomic recovery of the continent. That programme\ncalls on the international community for effective\nsupport. Members can easily understand why the\nAfrican countries place much hope in the debate that\n18\n\nthe General Assembly will devote to NEPAD\ntomorrow, 16 September, in which the President of\nGabon will take part.\nMalaria and, above all, HIV/AIDS are major\nobstacles to Africa's development that could ultimately\ndeprive the continent of much of its human potential.\nWe are pleased that the First Ladies of Africa have\nunderstood the gravity of this problem by creating, in\npartnership with the Joint United Nations Programme\non HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), an organization to combat\nmalaria and the HIV/AIDS pandemic, called the\nOrganization of the First Ladies of Africa against HIV/\nAIDS. We are convinced that this new\nstructure \u2014 headed by the First Lady of Gabon,\nMs. Edith Lucie Bongo, whose self-sacrifice and\ndynamism are well known \u2014 will complement the\nefforts of African States in combating this scourge. We\nalso expect strong action from the international\ncommunity to accompany our efforts in the fight\nagainst the pandemic.\nThe preservation of global ecosystems is another\nsubject of concern for the world. Only a few weeks\nago, heads of State or Government met at\nJohannesburg, South Africa, for the World Summit on\nSustainable Development. Despite the momentum it\ngenerated, the Summit did not reduce the risks that\nweigh on our environment. We think that, in view of\nthe lack of progress in implementing the\nrecommendations of environmental conferences\norganized over the past decade, it is becoming\nincreasingly urgent that States implement Agenda 21\nand the other relevant international instruments.\nGabon, for its part, has just created a zone of\nnational parks that covers 10 per cent of our national\nterritory. Those protected areas are proof of our\ncontribution to the process of preserving global\necological balance in general and to the management\nand conservation of Africa's massive tropical forest in\nparticular. That is why we welcome the launching in\nJohannesburg, by United States Secretary of State\nColin Powell, of the initiative to preserve the flora and\nfauna of the countries of the Congo river basin.\nPositive trends in the world can be guaranteed\nonly in an institutional environment bearing the seal of\nuniversality. The United Nations, in our view,\nembodies such an environment, where there must be\ntrue multilateral cooperation, based on justice, equality,\nsolidarity and the participation of all. It is evident that,\nin order to be a global centre for interaction and debate,\nthe United Nations needs reforms. Those reforms, for\nwhich we have been calling for several years, are\nunavoidable if we wish to see the continued existence\nof the United Nations, whose membership has\nincreased constantly since its creation in 1945. Reform\nof the Organization must be based on a reaffirmation of\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter, primary\namong which are international peace and security.\nThe International Court of Justice, in a 1949\nadvisory opinion concerning certain expenditures of\nthe United Nations, stated that it was natural to give\ntop priority to international peace and security, because\nthe other purposes could not be attained unless that\nfundamental condition were met. International peace\nand security are the preconditions for development,\nwhich in turn is a way to create the stability and well-\nbeing that are necessary to guarantee peaceful and\nfriendly relations among nations.\nThe United Nations is the property of humanity. It\nwas born out of awareness of the horrors of the Second\nWorld War, in which all peoples participated, including\nAfricans. We wish to see Africa play a more important\nrole in the Organization, particularly in the Security\nCouncil, by being given at least one permanent seat\nwith the same privileges as the other members with the\nsame status. Furthermore, Africa has been recognized\nby the United Nations as a top priority, and we are\nconvinced that the creation of a Secretariat office\nconcerned exclusively with African issues would\nremedy the shortcomings we have seen in the\nimplementation of previous programmes devoted to\nAfrica, such as the United Nations Programme for the\nEconomic Redressing and Development of Africa and\nthe United Nations New Agenda for the Development\nof Africa in the 1990s.\nOur collective action for development will not be\ntruly effective unless we use dialogue and cooperation\nas tools for global solidarity based on the promotion of\npartnerships. Today or never, we must reaffirm that we\nall belong to the one and only human race and define\nthe new contours of our collective destiny. We can thus\ndraw from our shared river, the United Nations, the\nresources that will enable us to build, with hope and\nconfidence, a better world for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all I wish to thank the President of the\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly, His\nExcellency Mr. Han Seung-soo, for the masterful way\nin which he accomplished his work. I would also like\nto thank the members of his Bureau. Significant\nprogress was made during the session we recently\nfinished. One item in particular concerns us as it\ninvolves the conduct and revitalization of our\nproceedings.\nSecondly, I would like to take this opportunity to\nwelcome the decision of the Secretary-General to\nappoint, as of 12 September 2002, Mr. Sergio Vieira de\nMello to succeed Her Excellency Mrs. Mary Robinson\nas United Nations High Commissioner for Human\nRights. My Government has always appreciated Mrs.\nRobinson's wholehearted commitment and knows it\ncan count on Mr. Vieira de Mello, who has many times\nshown his competence and his dedication to the\nOrganization, to show just as much commitment in\npromoting and protecting human rights.\nI am very pleased at the outset of the fifty-\nseventh session of the General Assembly to\ncongratulate Mr. Jan Kavan on his election to the\npresidency both on my own account and on behalf of\nthe highest authorities of my country, as well as to\ncongratulate all the members of the Bureau. I pledge\nthe full support and cooperation of the delegation of\nMonaco to help them complete their important work.\nOne year ago, an attack, as vile as it was\ncowardly, struck the United States of America. That\nday its instigators and perpetrators placed themselves\nnot only outside of the law, but outside humanity,\noutside of the universal fundamental values and\nprinciples that inspire our nations and guide the ethical,\npolitical, economic and social progress of States. That\nwanton act provoked an unprecedented reaction from\nthe international community. It unanimously gave the\nmembers of the Security Council and the General\nAssembly sophisticated means to fight terrorism in all\nits forms, including by cutting off its financial\nresources.\nThe Principality of Monaco participated in this\nfight with determination in response to requests by the\nSecurity Council and its Counter-Terrorism Committee.\nIn broadening information exchange with other States,\nboth bilaterally and multilaterally, we established or\nstrengthened monitoring and surveillance measures\nwhich were necessary in the of legislative, regulatory,\nand judicial spheres.\nOn 10 November 2001 I personally signed the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\nFinancing of Terrorism, which entered into force in\nMonaco on 8 April 2002, and our Permanent\nRepresentative to the United Nations, on instructions\nfrom my father, the Sovereign Prince, signed on 24\nJune 2002 Protocol Against the Illicit Manufacturing of\nTrafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components\nand Ammunition, supplementing the United Nations\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime.\nThe Principality of Monaco, in fact, is or will be\na party to all major universal and regional instruments\ndesigned to strengthen cooperation among nations to\nfight against terrorism. This has greatly enhanced our\ncooperation with other States.\nIn that regard I must make reference to a law\nwhich was adopted unanimously last June by our\nNational Council, the parliament of Monaco, and\nwhich entered into force on 8 August 2002. This law\namends, strengthens and supplements the existing law\non the involvement of financial entities in the fight\nagainst money-laundering and financing terrorism. The\ntext takes into account Monaco's undertakings as a\nUnited Nations Member State as well as measures\nanticipated by competent bodies such as the Financial\nAction Task Force.\nAlso on 8 August 2002, the authorities of my\ncountry were happy to have implemented the Council\nof Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure\nand Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime, even\nthough the Principality of Monaco, while fervently\nhoping to be so, is not yet a member of that noble\nEuropean institution. I also wish to note the speed and\nrelevance of my country's response, especially since\n8\n\nour country is sometimes subjected to unjustified and\nincorrect criticism in this area.\nWhile terrorist threats persist and while civilian\npopulations continue, unfortunately, to be subjected to\nthe yoke of terror, the origin and form of this plague\nseem now to be better understood and under greater\ncontrol. Measures, both national and international,\nhave been implemented with the help of the Security\nCouncil and its Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC)\nand seem to be yielding encouraging results. The\nstrengthening and broadening of the mandate of the\nTerrorism Prevention Branch, as the Secretary-General\nhas proposed in the report requested by our Assembly,\nseems to meet all of the conditions we need to upgrade\nthe fight against terrorism, not only by allowing us to\nbolster cooperation among United Nations Member\nStates, but also by providing enhanced technical\nassistance to countries that ask for it.\nThanks to a prompt and effective international\nreaction, Afghanistan, for too long a home to terrorists,\nhas regained its freedom. Its new provisional\nGovernment, which emerged from the traditional\nassembly, the Loya Jerga, last June, has endeavoured,\nparticularly with the help of our Organization, to\nrebuild the country and to establish a democratic\npolitical regime. We wish it full success.\nAnother area of satisfaction on the part of the\ninternational community is the nuclear disarmament\nagreement that was adopted last May by the two great\nPowers, the United States of America and the Russian\nFederation. Other events in the world are also hopeful.\nThe Republic of Sierra Leone and the Republic of\nAngola are taking steps towards recovery in a peaceful\nand democratic spirit. Encouraging signs of hope are\nseen everywhere. In Africa, we again fervently hope\nfor the success of the peace initiatives in Burundi and\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). A\ncalming of the situation in the Sudan is also of great\ninterest to us.\nThe Organization of African Unity (OAU), which\nbecame the African Union last July, has played an\ninvaluable role in reinforcing harmony between\nAfrican peoples. We are following this undertaking\nwith intense interest, as it took on a new dimension this\nyear. We take this opportunity to address to His\nExcellency, Mr. Amara Essy, Interim Chairperson of\nthe Commission of the African Union, our sincere\ncongratulations and encouragements.\nIn Latin America, we see with hope that some\ncountries, whose economic and financial conditions\nwere once in bad shape, are in the process of recovery,\nthanks in particular to the help of international\nfinancial institutions.\nIn Asia, finally, the prudence shown by the\nleaders of India and Pakistan over the border disputes\nhas led to the reduction of tension in Kashmir. We are\nsincerely grateful for this. This is an excellent step,\nsimilarly to the one taken by Sri Lanka, which has\nrenewed the dialogue with the Tamil separatists so as to\nput an end to too much suffering.\nAnother source of satisfaction is Timor-Leste,\nwhich with the effective and valuable help of our\nOrganization was able to successfully achieve\nindependence and acquire political and financial\nstructures that are crucial to its development. We are\ntherefore happy to welcome very soon, the Democratic\nRepublic of Timor-Leste to the United Nations. We are\nalso quite happy to welcome the admission of the\nSwiss Confederation as a Member State.\nSwitzerland has always been, particularly since\nthe creation of the League of Nations in Geneva, a\nsteadfast participant in the international promotion of\npeace, human rights and humanitarian protection. Our\ncongratulations and wishes for success and prosperity\nare formulated to those two States, to their leaders and\nto their people.\nThe United Nations needs them more than ever\nnow, and also needs all the good will and talent\npossible to meet the high ambitions that we set for\nourselves when the Organization was created,\nambitions renewed firmly and solemnly at the\nMillennium Summit, as well as during the large\ninternational meetings that followed.\nMy country is committed to implementing the\naction plans adopted during those exceptional\nmeetings. Our special session on children and the\nsecond World Assembly on Ageing have tangibly\nchanged the perception that the international\ncommunity had of children and seniors. Both must\nbecome actors who are more integrated and active\nwithin our societies.\nWhile deciding to increase its voluntary\ncontributions to the large programmes of the United\nNations aimed at development and the protection of the\nenvironment, the Government of Monaco has at the\n9\n\nsame time decided to concentrate its efforts on specific\nareas and specific regions. The Mediterranean region is\nan example of our fight against marine pollution that\naims to save regional flora and fauna. My Government,\nwhether through its Office for International\nCooperation for Development and the Environment, or\nthrough non-governmental organizations (NGOs),\nwhich are numerous and active in Monaco, is\nencouraging the implementation of specific projects,\nprojects that are essentially ecological in nature,\ndepending often on the availability of micro-credits.\nAs regards the Mediterranean Sea, next 10\nDecember we will be celebrating the twentieth\nanniversary of the United Nations Convention on the\nLaw of the Sea (UNCLOS). It was indeed on 10\nDecember 1982 that that text was open for ratification\nby States at Montego Bay in Jamaica. It was the result\nof almost 15 years of negotiations, which we will\nsolemnly celebrate on this coming occasion.\nThere are particularly difficult times, such as the\npresent moment, when the status quo is not good\nenough, times when we must show determination in\norder to bring innovative ideas to meet the fundamental\nchanges going on throughout the world. The Secretary-\nGeneral, whose dynamic nature and wisdom we\nappreciate, mentions this in his report on the follow-up\nto the major conferences organized by the United\nNations at different summits, including the Millennium\nSummit. The report is important and timely.\nThe substantive session of the Economic and\nSocial Council in July also confirmed the need for such\nsteps. The Ministerial Declaration, adopted on that\noccasion, focuses usefully on the importance of\ndeveloping human resources, protecting health, and\nproviding education, particularly for young girls, and\nfocuses on their contributions to development.\n I would like to commend the President and the\nBureau of the Council. His Excellency Mr. Ivan\nSimonovi\u0107, its President and the Permanent\nRepresentative of Croatia, and the other Members of\nthe Bureau have all toiled with competence and great\nskill in order to guarantee the success of the Council's\nwork.\nDuring the high-level debates, some trends\nemerged that our Government believes are essential.\nFor example, there is the choice of a governance that\nallows us to establish true partnerships that depend\nmostly on the human resources of developing countries\nthemselves, as well as on businesses and civil society.\nYesterday's high-level plenary meeting of the\nGeneral Assembly produced solemn and excellent\nresults and enabled us to gain a better understanding of\nthe character and the imperatives of the New\nPartnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), which\nundoubtedly offers real prospects for mobilizing\nresources for Africa and integrating it into the world\neconomy. The establishment by the Economic and\nSocial Council of an ad hoc advisory group for African\ncountries emerging from conflict is a step that we are\nalso following. Without political stability, there can be\nno guaranteed sustainable development.\nThe concept of a culture of protection' advanced\nby the Secretary-General, with regard to special\neconomic assistance, humanitarian aid, and help in\nnatural disasters, provides the advantage of associating\nin a single thrust preventive action and priority\nassistance to the communities affected. We appreciate\nthe principle and the scope of this activity.\nIn the aftermath of conflicts and crises, the link\nbetween humanitarian action and long-term\ndevelopments is crucial for the success of any national\nreconstruction programme. Public meetings of the\nSecurity Council dedicated to such matters provide an\nopportunity to emphasize, with the necessary impact,\nthe importance of such measures.\nThe World Summit on Sustainable Development\n(WSSD), which has just finished in Johannesburg and\nin which I participated, reminded us of the essential\nconcerns for the future. The Monterrey consensus was\nconfirmed, stressing the fact that there can now be no\nstable and balanced development without serious\ninterdisciplinary thought and innovative ideas based on\na genuine will to protect our environment and to\nrespect the natural resources of our planet, including\nsea resources and non-renewable natural resources, by\nensuring that we share them fairly and reasonably.\nThe Summit confirmed and strengthened the\nprinciples proclaimed 10 years ago during the United\nNations Conference on Environment and Development,\nheld at Rio.\nI will not reiterate my country's positions and\ninitiatives on these questions, as I discussed them at\nlength at Johannesburg. I should like to reaffirm,\nhowever, that the Government of the Principality of\n10\n\nMonaco is determined to respect the commitments it\nundertook on that occasion.\nThe international community must continue to\nwork tirelessly in the combat against AIDS and in the\nfight against many endemic diseases, which, in some\nparts of the world, are major obstacles to development\nand progress. In response to the appeal launched by our\nSecretary-General, my Government has decided this\nyear and for the next two years to make a substantial\nexceptional contribution to the Joint United Nations\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS.\nIf we want globalization, in particular economic\nglobalization, to be of benefit to all, it will have to be\nrooted to a greater extent  and we all are aware of\nthis  in a type of development that ignores neither\nthe basic needs of human beings nor the values of\njustice, morality and equity, to which we all attach\nparticular value.\nIn speaking of the fundamental principle of\njustice and of the moral values which have inspired our\nOrganization so profoundly, I should like to reiterate\nhow warmly we welcomed the recent entry into force\nof the Rome Statute of the International Criminal\nCourt. The first Assembly of States Parties to the Rome\nStatute has just been held, under the eminent\npresidency of His Royal Highness Prince Zeid Ra'ad\nZeid Al-Hussein, Permanent Representative of the\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Decisive and specific\nsteps were taken on that occasion.\nI should like to close by appealing to the peoples\nof Israel and Palestine to put an end to the violence and\nto overcome their rancour and resentments. A shared\nheritage and the belief in a future of coexistence\nrepresent the underpinnings of a dialogue leading to\npeace.\n\n\n\n"

I should also like to express my deep\nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo,\nForeign Minister of the Republic of Korea, for his\ntireless efforts in conducting the proceedings of the\nfifty-sixth session, as well as of the twenty-seventh\nspecial session of the Assembly, on children.\nI should also like to express our deep appreciation\nto Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his continued\nefforts to enhance the role of the United Nations and to\nenable it to achieve the noble and lofty objectives for\nwhich it was created.\nFurthermore, I am pleased to extend my\ncongratulations to the Swiss Confederation on its\nhaving joined the Organization. I would like also to\ncongratulate East Timor on attaining its independence.\nIt is also my pleasure to welcome the establishment of\nthe African Union, the successor to the Organization of\nAfrican Unity.\n9\n\nThis session was convened on the first\nanniversary of 11 September, an event that terrified the\ninternational community, shocked the human\nconscience and unified international efforts to face up\nto an enemy that has no religion, ethnicity, race or\nnationality. That enemy is terrorism.\nOn this painful anniversary, it is incumbent upon\nus to again extend our condolences and sympathy to\nthe United States of America and its friendly people,\nand to the families of the victims everywhere, and to\ncondemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\nWe affirm our support for all international efforts that\nseek to combat its elements and to uproot it.\nIn line with the purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter and with international efforts,\nthe Kingdom of Bahrain has sought, since attaining\nindependence, to build a modern State and a civil\nsociety in which the human being is the focal point.\nSuch a human being would be prepared and qualified\nto cope with the political, economic and social\nrequirements of modern life.\nMoreover, taking firm and confident steps, the\nKingdom of Bahrain affirms its commitment to the\ndevelopment and modernization process taking place\nunder the leadership of His Majesty Shaikh Hamad Bin\nIsa Al-Khalifa, King of the Kingdom of Bahrain. My\ncountry was proclaimed a constitutional monarchy\nfollowing a plebiscite on our National Action Charter,\ndesigned to promote democratic and constitutional life\nin Bahrain. The municipal elections in May 2002, in\nwhich women participated both as voters and as\ncandidates, were a success; preparations are now under\nway for parliamentary elections, which are to take\nplace in October.\nThe Government and the people have made a\nconcerted effort to ensure success in the democratic\nand developmental process, as set out in the Kingdom's\nConstitution and in its policies and programmes in all\nfields. In this regard, the Kingdom has acceded to the\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of\nDiscrimination against Women. Civic activities have\nbeen enhanced and the number of non-governmental\norganizations has risen. These have been promoted so\nthat all the people of Bahrain may participate in\nexpanding national efforts to ensure the well-being of\nthe people and respect for human rights in all civil,\npolitical, economic, social and cultural areas.\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain takes pride in these\nachievements, which have been recognized by the\nUnited Nations Human Development Report for 2002,\nwhich ranked the Kingdom of Bahrain high among all\ncountries of the world and, for the sixth time, first\namong sisterly Arab States. Furthermore, the Arab\nHuman Development Report 2002 has also mentioned\nour achievements, showing once again the success of\nthe Kingdom's democratic and development strategy in\nall areas.\nMoreover, the leadership and the people of the\nKingdom of Bahrain are proud that, in a report recently\npublished by the United Nations Industrial\nDevelopment Organization, Bahrain was ranked 42nd\namong the 87 countries included in the report, and first\nin the Arab world.\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain attaches great\nimportance to the question of regional security, because\nof the repercussions it has on the security and stability\nof States and peoples. Accordingly, Bahrain has\nconsistently sought to consolidate neighbourly\nrelations and mutual respect with its neighbouring\nStates. Bahrain looks forward to the peaceful resolution\nof the question of the three Emirates islands, in\naccordance with the principles and rules of\ninternational law and in a brotherly spirit of\nunderstanding, on the basis of recent positive\ndevelopments in the relations between the States\nmembers of the Gulf Cooperation Council and the\nIslamic Republic of Iran, and in the light of the direct\ncontacts that have taken place recently, in particular\nthose between the United Arab Emirates and Iran.\nFurthermore, the Arab Summit, held in Beirut last\nMarch, confirmed the necessity and importance of\nsecurity and stability in the Gulf region and of creating\na propitious atmosphere for the restoration of normal\nrelations among the States of the region. It called upon\nIraq to complete the implementation of relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions on the situation between\nIraq and Kuwait, especially those relating to Kuwaiti\nand third-country prisoners of war; to cooperate with\nthe United Nations with a view to alleviating the\nsuffering of the people of Iraq; and to avoid any\nconfrontation that might threaten the States and\npeoples of the region or the unity and territorial\nintegrity of Iraq, and that might be used as a pretext for\ninterfering in Iraq's internal affairs.\n10\n\nThe Middle East is currently facing great danger\nas a result of Israel's policy in the occupied Palestinian\nterritories and of its perpetration of the most heinous\ncrimes against the Palestinian people, such as\nassassinations, blockades and the destruction of the\ninfrastructure and the economy. The events that took\nplace in the Jenin refugee camp and in the Gaza Strip,\nalong with the daily events that occur in all other\nPalestinian cities, are clear indications of the Israeli\nGovernment's aggression and violation of international\nlaw and norms and of its unwillingness to accept peace\nor comply with the international agreements it has\nsigned.\nFurthermore, the Palestinian people are still\nresisting this ferocious assault with great courage and\ndetermination, thus asserting their right to fight the\noccupation and emphasizing their belief in their just\ncause, while upholding their legitimate leadership and\ndefending their national rights, as endorsed by the\ninternational community, in accordance with Security\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), and other\nrelevant resolutions, the latest being Council resolution\n1397 (2002). They are also upholding the principle of\nland for peace and the establishment of an independent\nPalestinian State on their national land, with Jerusalem\nas its capital.\nOn the basis of its principles and in support of\njustice, Bahrain has always stood by the brotherly\npeople of Palestine. It affirms its full support for the\nArab peace initiative adopted at the Arab Summit held\nat Beirut in March 2002 on the basis of the vision\noffered by His Royal Highness Prince Abdullah Bin\nAbdul-Aziz Al-Saud, Crown Prince of the Kingdom of\nSaudi Arabia. That vision provides for an end to the\nMiddle East conflict, the establishment of normal\nrelations with Israel in exchange for its withdrawal\nfrom all the occupied Arab territories to the borders of\n4 June 1967, including withdrawal from the Syrian\nArab Golan Heights and the remaining Lebanese\noccupied territories, and a just settlement of the\nquestion of Palestinian refugees in accordance with\nGeneral Assembly resolution 194 (III) of 1948.\nThe oppression to which the Palestinian people\nare subjected and the ongoing situation that threatens\nsecurity and peace in the Middle East and the world\nrequire immediate intervention by the Security Council\nand the international community to stop Israeli\npractices against the Palestinian people and to\nreactivate the Arab peace initiative at the regional and\ninternational levels. That initiative is a viable basis for\nany move towards the achievement of a just and\ncomprehensive peace in the region.\nBahrain has welcomed the initiative of the United\nStates Secretary of State with respect to convening a\npeace conference on the Middle East, on the basis of\nideas and principles put forward by the Arab Summit in\nthe Arab peace initiative and of the relevant\ninternational resolutions. It hopes that a just and\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East will thus be\nachieved, leading to stability and security, ending the\ncycle of conflict and violence, and bringing instead a\ncycle of fruitful cooperation among the countries of the\nregion.\nBahrain has also reaffirmed this position by\nwelcoming the positive ideas in President Bush's 24\nJune 2002 statement on the Middle East. Those ideas\nwere reiterated in his statement before the General\nAssembly last Thursday and related to the settlement of\nthe Middle East conflict within the framework of the\nresolutions of international legitimacy, and with a view\nto establishing a Palestinian State living side by side\nwith Israel in peace and security.\nThe Arab side, through the Arab peace initiative\nand by accepting the ideas that President Bush has put\nforward, has clearly demonstrated its interest in\nsecurity and stability in the region. The Israeli side has\nyet to detail what plans it has for peace and what\nposition it has taken vis-\u00e0-vis the Arab peace initiative\nand the ideas put forward by President Bush. What is\nneeded now is to translate those ideas and initiatives\ninto plans and practical steps that benefit peace and put\nan end to the present deteriorating situation.\nIn the light of Bahrain's religious and cultural\ntraditions, as reflected in our Constitution and national\nlaws and as reaffirmed by our policies that focus, inter\nalia, on the right to life, security and peace, we would\nlike to reaffirm our strong rejection of all forms and\nmanifestations of terrorism. We would also welcome\nthe convening under United Nations auspices of an\ninternational conference on terrorism, with a view to\nreaching an internationally agreed definition of\nterrorism that differentiates between unacceptable\nterrorist acts and legitimate struggle and resistance by\npeople against foreign occupation to achieve national\nliberation and self-determination, and to defend\nthemselves in accordance with the United Nations\nCharter, to which we adhere in word and deed.\n\n\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain has followed with great\ninterest the developments in Afghanistan, a country\nthat has lacked stability and has suffered the ravages of\nwar for many years. We welcome the measures taken\nby the Government of Afghanistan with a view to\npromoting security and stability and restoring normal\nlife for its people. We have also cooperated fully with\nthe Committee established pursuant to Security Council\nresolution 1373 (2001) on financial and logistical\nmeasures against terrorist activities, in line with the\nconcept of collective action within the United Nations.\nBahrain has supported all initiatives to establish\nnuclear-weapon-free zones and has supported other\nconfidence-building measures in regions such as the\nMiddle East, where we have supported the creation of a\nzone free of all weapons of mass destruction,\nespecially nuclear weapons, in accordance with the\nrelevant General Assembly resolutions. We call upon\nall our neighbours to support this idea in order to\nrelease resources that could be used for the prosperity\nand development of peoples. We call on the United\nNations to exert pressure on Israel to accede to the\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\nand to subject its nuclear facilities to the\ncomprehensive safeguards system of the International\nAtomic Energy Agency.\nDialogue and tolerance among States and peoples\ncontribute to the promotion of understanding and the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Based\non that conviction, and emphasizing the importance we\nattach to General Assembly resolution 53/22 of 16\nNovember 1998 concerning the United Nations Year of\nDialogue among Civilizations, the Kingdom of Bahrain\nhas hosted a seminar organized in cooperation with the\nGovernment of Japan. A number of internationally\nknown intellectuals from the Arab and Islamic worlds\nand from Japan participated in the seminar, which was\nconvened last March and was entitled \u201cThe Dialogue\namong Civilizations: The Islamic World and Japan\u201d.\nThe seminar sought to promote dialogue between Arab-\nIslamic civilizations and other civilizations so that\ndifferent cultures may grow closer to one another.\nIn furtherance of this approach, the Kingdom of\nBahrain will also host the tenth session of the Islamic-\nChristian Dialogue Conference, to be held from 28 to\n30 October 2002. The objective is to promote better\nunderstanding between world religions and cultures,\nand to enhance interaction and exchange in order to\npreserve the progress that has been made and to\ninvigorate an informed outlook for the future, wherein\ncooperation in the interest of the entire human race,\nwithout discrimination, can take place.\nIn conclusion, I would like to state that, thanks to\ncooperative efforts, the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment, recently held in Johannesburg, provided\na favourable opportunity for the review and evaluation\nof achievements made over the past 10 years, the\nidentification of impediments and challenges, the\ndevelopment of strategies and the identification of\nobjectives and priorities for joint action. It is our hope\nthat all States will implement the outcome of the\nJohannesburg Summit and will address the challenges\nfacing us all, especially the developing States.\nIn that context, the Kingdom of Bahrain would\nlike once again to affirm the importance of practical\nand effective implementation of the Millennium\nDeclaration with regard to development and the role of\nthe international community and international\norganizations in supporting national efforts in that\nfield.\nWe are confident that the United Nations, with\nthe determination, political will and hard work of its\nMember States, is capable of efforts that will help us\nachieve our shared goals of just peace, economic\nprosperity and social justice throughout the world. It is\nin our interest to cooperate with one another to make\nthe United Nations the main engine of our activities, in\norder to achieve a better world: one of peace, security,\nprosperity and justice for all peoples and all States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, may I congratulate President Jan\nKavan, well known for his expertise in human rights,\non his election to preside over this General Assembly.\nMy congratulations also go to the outgoing President,\nMr. Han Seung-soo, for his hard work, and I commend\nthe United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan,\nwhose stewardship of the Organization in these trying\ntimes is particularly admirable. I also congratulate\nSwitzerland on its admission to membership in the\nOrganization.\nThis session of the General Assembly, more than\nin recent years, seems caught between the past and the\nfuture \u2014 a tragic past, an uncertain future. In New\nYork, and in the world, the catastrophe of the attacks of\n11 September seems so present with us that we feel its\nimprint still upon us, as if our souls were marked by\nthe fall of the towers and the cruel loss of life. We feel\nthis past as a tangible, palpable weight, and we also\nsense the future pressing in upon us.\nThis past year, we have witnessed the war in\nAfghanistan, the fall of the Taliban and the\nestablishment of a new Government in Kabul. Will\nthere be intervention in Iraq, will there be more attacks\nin America, in Europe, or elsewhere? What will the\nfuture bring?\nI ask these questions as Foreign Minister of the\nPrincipality of Andorra. Andorra is a small and\npeaceful country nestled in the protected valleys of the\nPyrenees. We have lived in peace for nearly a thousand\nyears. And yet we are not safe from the storms that\nbuffet the world. Because of our small size, our\nreliance on trade and our relations with our neighbours\nand the world \u2014 our diplomacy, if you will \u2014 are of\nthe greatest importance to our well-being. As we turn\nto the world, so, too, the world turns to us in the tens of\nmillions of tourists that visit us every year.\nOur industries, our citizens and our lives are as\nintimately linked to the world as to the mountains that\nsurround us. This link was clear in the profound\nsadness of our people over the loss of life in New York,\nWashington and Pennsylvania. We felt it as a visceral\nblow, a spontaneous expression of true sympathy.\nThe world surrounds us, although we often feel\nwe can do little to influence the course of events. And\nyet what we do know is how actively to seek peace,\nand thereby ensure our future. It is about the future, the\nidea of the future, that I wish to speak today.\nThe future. In order to understand it, we must\nlook not only to those events that are determining it,\nthat are forming it even as we speak, but also to its own\nhistory as an idea. What is the history of the future?\n24\n\nHere I will only invoke, in passing, two earlier\nmodels that 500 years ago embodied our understanding\nof the future: God's providence and the wheel of\nFortune. In the providential model of the future, God\nlooks down on the full history of the world from \u201cthe\nhigh citadel of eternity\u201d in the words of Thomas\nAquinas. He sees everything, every grain of sand,\nevery sparrow that falls. \u201cThere is a special providence\nin the fall of a sparrow\u201d Hamlet tells Laertes in\nShakespeare's great play. But alongside this Christian\nunderstanding of God's providence is another figure,\nthe pagan figure of Fortuna, who holds her wheel on\nwhich all men, king and commoner, rise and fall.\nHamlet is also aware of her power; he is buffeted by\nthe slings and arrows of outrageous Fortune, and he\nlongs to end his life, but he fears God's prohibition\nagainst suicide. This very prohibition, shared by all\nthree of the great religions of the West, was broken by\nthe suicide attacks of 11 September. So, too, the\nprohibition that \u201cthou shall not kill\u201d. Life is precious: it\nis given to us, and we cannot take it away.\nIn these two models of the future, humanity is\npassive. We are puppets \u2014 God or Fortune pulls our\nstrings. But gradually we drew away from this passive\nenslavement to our fate, our destiny, and we struggled\nto master the future. The change in the future is first\nheard in the writings of that first theorist of diplomacy,\nthe cunning Machiavelli. In The Prince, he wrote that a\nruler must learn to profit from chance, or rather turn\nchance to his favour. In a typically violent metaphor, he\ntells the Prince that Fortune must be beaten.\nMachiavelli counsels him to wrestle with fortune and\nthereby create the future.\nAlthough Machiavelli was advising an absolute\nmonarch, and indeed his thought presaged a long\nperiod of monarchical absolutism, he understood that\nthe rulers and the administrators could no longer afford\nto be passive objects of history. They had to consider,\nto think, to attack fortune; to hurl the slings and shoot\nthe arrows back at her, if you will. In this shift, from\npassive object to active agent, the idea of the future\nbegins its transformation. In this future, Machievelli's\nheirs \u2014 diplomats gathered here today \u2014 advise the\nmodern princes, the democratically elected rulers of the\nworld, for the general good of the people.\nThe future becomes an idea that we build through\nstrategy, thought and action, through laws and treaties\nwe enter into and must obey. That is the very purpose\nof the United Nations, the great parliament of the\nworld's Governments, or in a less poetic but more apt\nimage, a great, international factory, in that it builds the\nfuture: a future, not for the wealthy or the powerful,\nnot for some nations, but for the world and its peoples.\nOut of the ruins of the Second World War, the\nnations of the world joined to create a better future for\nall humanity. The belief that binds us together is the\nbelief that together, only together, we can build a better\nworld for all: a glorious city on the hill; a new\nJerusalem; a Jerusalem of all religions, all beliefs; a\ncity of tolerance; a city very much like New York.\nThat is why, I think, the terrorist attacks were so\npainful, for New York City is very much an expression\nof the United Nations, a place for all of the citizens of\nthe world, all religions and all beliefs \u2014 the city of\ntolerance; a city that resolutely looks forward to the\nfuture; New York: city of dreams, city of the future.\nStrangely, even as New York was profoundly\nwounded by these attacks, no other city, I think, has\nbeen so resolute in looking forward. The city was not,\nnor is it, spoiled by revenge. New York always looks to\nthe future. While others may reproach the city for its\nindifference to its past, its forward-looking optimism is\nperhaps its greatest gift to the world.\nSo when we all saw in Andorra and elsewhere the\nattacks on the World Trade Center, my first response\nwas that the suicide hijackers did not know New York.\nThey did not know that this city has brought people\nfrom all countries together. They did not know the\npeople who would die in the collapse of the towers:\npeople from many of the religions and countries of the\nworld.\nBut then I realized that perhaps they did know,\nthat perhaps New York was their target, and that their\ntarget was the future. Or rather, their target was a\nfuture of tolerance: religious, cultural, personal.\nIndeed, it seems that the terrorists longed for purity, for\na pure vision of the future in which the tolerance \u2014 the\nimpurities \u2014 of New York would have no place.\nThey believed, but not in the uncertain future of\nNew York, the restless striving for the new. They\nbelieved that with their deaths they would enter\nparadise of the afterlife. They believed, sacrilegiously,\nthat they were the means of God's providence.\nWhen the terrorists attacked America, they also\nattacked the future. They attacked the future of\ntolerance, a future controlled not by fate, but by\n25\n\nmankind. We cannot let our notion of the future fall\nwith the towers, for the future is as fragile as the\ntowers proved to be, perhaps more so. The future is\nbuilt not of steel and stone, but of law and human\nsympathy.\nIn a way, I think, at least for the moment and\nperhaps necessarily, the terrorist attack on the future\nhas damaged it. It demanded a strong response: the\nmission in Afghanistan, the continued destruction of Al\nQaeda. That is the kind of response that the\nperpetrators of that violence would understand; a\nresponse that cannot be seen as a sign of weakness or\nvulnerability. It is a logical, and therefore necessary,\nresponse that the terrorists themselves unleashed.\nBut violence breeds violence, and the future of\nviolence is simple destruction: nothing \u2014 and nothing\nwill come of nothing. We run the risk of entering an\nendless war against a shadowy enemy; a war that,\ngiven the nature of the enemy, might prove very hard to\nwin completely. And yet it must be won.\nOur first and strongest line of defence against\nviolence is the rule of law, with diplomacy to enact it.\nThe United States, founded on the rule of law and on\nrights for all, understands that. Andorra understands\nthat, because without law we would not have survived\nas a country for nearly a millennium.\nThat is why Andorra believes in and supports\ninternational law and trusts the United Nations,\nparticularly its democratic members, to lead the world\nfrom its history of violence towards its common future.\nIn relation to Iraq, Andorra supports the role of the\nUnited Nations, and we shall follow carefully the\ndebates in the Security Council.\nTerrorism is not a conventional war: there can be\nno treaties, no compacts, with terrorists. Law is vital\nfor all countries, but terrorists do not care about laws.\nThey are without a country and pose a particular\ndanger and challenge. In that sense, we must embark\non an aggressive reaching out to all people, an\naggressive assertion of our common humanity. That\nmight well be a media campaign, although it needs to\ncome directly from all elected politicians and ministers.\nWe are not trying to abstract issues or win a war of\nwords. We need to pull everybody into the human\ncompact. We need to recognize our individual\nvulnerability.\nIt was America's belief in its invulnerability that\nwas so profoundly shaken by the terrorist attack. Yet if\nthe sudden collapse of the towers and the fear and\nchaos of that day revealed a weakness, it also revealed\nstrength: the strength of its citizens' resolve and the\nprofound sympathy of all the peoples of the world.\nIn the wake of 11 September we recognize both\nthe need for the rule of law and the cause of that need:\nthe vulnerability of all people to malevolent attack. The\nmotto of Andorra is Virtus Unita Fortior, which can be\nloosely translated as \u201cUnited We Stand\u201d. That is not\nsimply an appeal to patriotism or for a common front\nagainst the enemy. It is a recognition that together\npeople are stronger, because alone we are weak and\nvulnerable.\nNothing can justify the attack of 11 September\n2001. It is nevertheless important, here in the General\nAssembly, to consider the roots of violence. The\nterrorists turned their anger and alienation \u2014 political,\ncultural, economic and personal \u2014 into an abstract act\nof inhuman cruelty whose \u201csolution\u201d was the attack on\nthe towers. Only in the cold world of abstraction does\nthat attack symbolize anything beyond untold\nsuffering. We need to pull violence back from\nabstraction into the world of human conversation.\nIf people feel excluded from the future, their\nalienation gives them a mad and violent certainty. We\nmust get to work to rebuild an inclusive and tolerant\nidea of the future, an idea that is all too easily forgotten\nin war, an idea of the future in which everybody is\nprotected from those who would destroy it, an idea of\nthe future so strong that it includes those people who\nmight otherwise be tempted by the madness of playing\nGod.\nThat future is premised on awareness, not of the\nstrength of the nuclear nations or of powerful\neconomies, but of the vulnerability of this compact and\nof individual nations large and small. We must\nrecognize the power of our vulnerability, for in this\nrecognition, we recover our strength, our vision of a\ncommon future and the will to act together. It is\ntogether that we will win the war against terrorism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow\nme to begin, Sir, by congratulating you on your\nelection to preside over the fifty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly. My congratulations go likewise to\nthe outgoing president, His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-\nsoo, for his dedication and for a job well done. I wish\nalso to echo earlier speakers in welcoming, very\nwarmly, Switzerland as the newest Member of the\nOrganization and Timor-Leste, which will be joining us\nshortly.\nGlobal security models, which are in a process of\nchange after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001,\nhave posed serious and unexpected challenges to the\ninternational community. We have been faced with\ntragic proof that our security is more fragile than we\nhad imagined and that democracy and freedom have\nbeen under attack. We have been violently reminded\nthat combating terrorism is a matter for us all.\nThe prompt and constructive response of my\ncountry, Romania, to the United Nations appeal for\nsolidarity has been very clear. Our participation in the\nInternational Assistance Force for Afghanistan,\napproved by the Romanian Parliament in December\n2001, clearly attests to our resolve to fulfil, in practice\nas well as in spirit, our commitment to the principles\nand purposes of the United Nations.\nFollowing the adoption by the Security Council\nof its resolution 1373 (2001), we enacted legislation to\nprevent, in Romania, the financing of terrorist\norganizations and acts, and we have ratified the 12\nUnited Nations conventions and protocols concerning\nterrorism.\nWe have been actively involved in operations in\nAfghanistan with our strategic allies and we are,\ntogether, tackling the consequences of the struggle\nagainst terrorism.\n(spoke in English)\nBut have we, the international community, done\nenough? The Secretary-General, in his opening\n14\n\nstatement, drew an uncompromising picture of the\nthreats to peace, and rightly reminded us of our\nresponsibilities.\nRomania believes it is necessary to proceed\nunambiguously in condemning and actively combating\nall forms of terrorism and violent fanaticism through\ncooperation at the international level that is\nsubstantive, consistent and coherent. The financing of\nterrorism is an obvious target for action. Romania\nbelieves that the experience of regional liaison and\njoint operations in South-East Europe can be of use to\ninternational efforts to suppress the flow of funds to\nterrorist groups.\nThe terrorist threat calls for us to be even more\nvigilant in controlling the use and proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction, as well as conventional\nweapons, such as landmines and small arms, which can\nfall \u2014 sometimes too often \u2014 into the wrong hands. In\nthis context, Romania calls on Iraq to comply with\nexisting Security Council resolutions and to allow\nUnited Nations inspectors to return, immediately and\nunconditionally, to enable further decisions to be taken\nrelevant to the people of Iraq and the security and\nstability of the area. Romania was on the Security\nCouncil in 1990 when the first resolutions on Iraq were\nadopted and contributed to building consensus at that\ntime. We believe that the Security Council must\nrespond to the continued defiance of its resolutions\nfirmly and resolutely. There can be no doubt as to my\nGovernment's stand should fears about possible threats\nto global security prove justified. As we have done in\nthe past, we will stand alongside our allies and\nfreedom-loving nations in the defence of world peace.\nA strong response to Iraq's long-term defiance of\nthe Security Council's authority is also called for\nbecause of the threat to global security from weapons\nof mass destruction. The temptation to apply these\nsame principles to other, localized conflict situations\nshould be resisted, especially when mechanisms exist\nfor dialogue and peaceful resolution. While States have\nthe right to exercise control over their own security,\nthey also have a responsibility to ensure that security\nmeasures do not undermine the foundations of\ndemocracy. We can adapt to these new realities without\nsacrificing human rights and universal values. Indeed,\nthrough respect for civil liberties and the promotion of\nequal opportunity and social cohesion, we can help to\nremove some of the root causes of terrorism:\nresentment and frustration fuelled by poverty and\nmarginalization.\nThis is a fundamental element of conflict\nprevention, but early warning and early intervention by\nthe international community are not enough. The\nexperiences of the last decade show that it is time to\nmove away from ad hoc solutions for short-term\nproblems towards an integrated and long-term\napproach to nation-building. By \u201cintegrated\u201d, I mean\nthat the international response should be based on an\nefficient division of labour between the appropriate\norganizations, with a common mandate and a clear\nchain of command. By \u201clong-term\u201d, I mean that\ninternational support should remain in place until\nsecurity is seen to be durable and rehabilitation and\nlocal empowerment have become a reality.\nThe stabilization and rehabilitation process in\nAfghanistan is a test for the changing pattern of\ninternational cooperation. Ultimately, reconstruction\nefforts must be directed towards sustainability and\nownership by the Afghan people. The recent attempt on\nPresident Karzai's life demonstrates the frailty of the\ncurrent situation in Afghanistan. This and the attacks in\nKabul and other cities are dramatic reminders of the\nprice paid by too many Afghan generations for\nrecovering their sovereignty and for winning the right\nto govern their country.\nThe intense effort that the United Nations has\nembarked upon in the democratic and physical\nreconstruction of the country is commendable.\nRomania believes that this commitment must be\nmaintained as long as the dangers of a serious renewal\nof violence exist. Romania has already made a solid\nfinancial contribution to the international aid effort and\nis ready to offer further assistance, according to the\nrequirements of the Afghan Government.\nBut efforts to aid Afghanistan should not stop at\nthat country's borders. Stability for that country and the\nregion will be assured only through a broader vision\nfor the development of the whole of Central Asia. We\nneed to find a way to link Europe and Central Asia by\nworking up an integrated strategy that will reinforce\ndemocracy and bring economic prosperity not only\nacross Europe, but to Eurasia as well. A first step must\nbe to put an end to the \u201cfrozen conflicts\u201d in Eastern\nEurope and the Caucasus.\nThe positive developments in South-East Europe\nshow what can be achieved when the international\n15\n\ncommunity takes action in a coherent and coordinated\nway. The United Nations and its international partners,\nnotably the European Union, the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe and the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization, have worked tirelessly to\nhelp to reconstitute societies based on the rule of law\nand ethnic tolerance, but the process is not yet\ncomplete. It is vital that this decisive electoral autumn\nshow beyond doubt that modern democracy has taken\nroot in the western Balkans. By ensuring free and fair\nelections, political leaders in the region should keep\ntheir countries on the right path to European\nintegration. As Romania draws closer to achieving its\nEuro-Atlantic integration ambitions, we will continue\nto contribute actively to efforts to break down the\nremaining divisions in South-East Europe and to speed\nup the integration of the whole region into the\nEuropean mainstream.\nThe violent conflicts over the last decade awoke\nthe world to the need for action against the horror of\nwar crimes. The entry into force on 1 July of the\nInternational Criminal Court Statute represents a very\nsignificant step forward. Romania ratified the\nInternational Criminal Court Statute this year and\nremains deeply committed to ensuring that the Court\nfunction effectively as a viable and necessary\ninstrument of international law. In this spirit, we\nencourage ongoing discussions, which should clarify\nsome of the outstanding issues.\nThe danger that the violence in the Middle East\nwill escalate beyond control cannot be ignored. My\nrecent discussions with political leaders from the\nregion have reinforced my conviction that it is crucial\nto find a way to renounce the logic of war in favour of\na logic of peace. We call on the parties to engage in\nserious negotiations for a peaceful, comprehensive and\nlasting solution. Their success or failure will have\nconsequences far beyond their own immediate region,\nimpacting upon what might be termed the wider\nMiddle East, encompassing the entire region from\nCentral Asia to North Africa.\nThe two serious challenges for the twenty-first\ncentury are fighting terrorism and new security threats,\non the one hand, and making globalization work for\neveryone everywhere, on the other. In both, the United\nNations has a decisively important role to play. We\nhave reached the point where we must address the\nglobal agenda in a way that finally meets people's\nexpectations and achieves early results. We must\ndeliver in a coherent and pragmatic way on the\ncommitments taken at Doha, Monterrey and\nJohannesburg, as well as other major United Nations\nconferences, such as the special session on children.\nWe must design an urgent, clear and encouraging\nresponse to the humanitarian needs of Africa and\npromote conditions for the sustainable development of\nthe African continent.\nTangible progress depends upon a new paradigm\nof cooperation between stakeholders of globalization,\nStates, corporations, international organizations and, of\ncourse, civil society. Efficient implementation depends\nupon a new architecture of global governance that is\nfitted to today's realities and a renewed sense of\nresponsibility among all States. Finally, success in\nachieving the millennium development goals depends\nupon a strict and verifiable system for monitoring\nimplementation. A new sense of participation and\npartnership must energize our common contribution. In\nthis respect, We welcome President Bush's\nannouncement that the United States will rejoin the\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization.\nThe graduation of the Central European countries\nfrom transition economies to membership of the\nEuropean Union in the few years to come is proof that\ndemocracy with a functioning market economy and an\nopen society does work. But there is a price, and that is\nthe difficult decisions, politically and socially, of\nsuccessful transition.\nWe have been fortunate to have European Union\nfinancial support and know-how, which have been vital\nin maintaining the momentum and the public\nacceptance of sometimes painful reform programmes.\nIn return, we will do the same by sharing the burden of\ninternational responsibility and assistance. We have not\nonly a moral and historic, but also a strategic,\nresponsibility to address the needs of the poor and\ndisadvantaged in our region and beyond. Discontent\nand disillusionment breed instability, which in turn\ngives terrorism fertile conditions in which to flourish.\nGovernments, business and civil society have a\nunique opportunity to accelerate economic\ndevelopment through the use of the powerful new\ninformation and communication technologies. In\npreparation for the forthcoming World Summit on the\nInformation Society, to be held at Geneva in 2003 and\nat Tunis in 2005, Romania will host, from 7 to 9\n16\n\nNovember this year, a regional conference at the\nministerial level organized jointly with the\nInternational Telecommunication Union and the\nEconomic Commission for Europe. Our aim is to draw\nup a preliminary plan of action with specific\nmechanisms for bridging the digital divide.\nThe Security Council is the linchpin of the United\nNations. Romania believes that we must redouble our\nefforts to promote reform of that body. The\ncomposition of the Council should be more\nrepresentative of our global membership and should\nreflect more accurately the realities of the global\nbalance of power today. Romania's candidature for a\nCouncil seat in 2004-2005 is motivated by our deep\ncommitment to the United Nations as a credible and\nefficient contributor to peace and stability around the\nworld.\nWhat will we take home from this session? We\nneed to reflect on how to eliminate the habit of ad hoc\ncooperation. We need to think creatively and to craft\ncontinuous patterns of teamwork, and we should be\nmore receptive to what people want from the United\nNations. That is how we can best live up to our\ncommitments and overcome what is seen as the\nhandicap of international organizations: the\ndiscrepancy between words and deeds. Let us leave this\nsession determined to work on mapping out pledges\nand achievements in a way that will add vigour to our\nwords and reinforce our credibility. That, after all, is\nthe source of our unique strength.\n\n\n\n\n"

May I also extend our congratulations to\nTimor-Leste, soon to be a Member of the Organization,\nand to Switzerland, which has just become a Member.\nWe hope that East Timor's becoming a full member of\nthe international community will guarantee that its\nbrotherly people will have the right to live free of the\nhegemonic appetite of some of their neighbours.\nFew people in the world have ever heard of my\ncountry  Sao Tome and Principe.\n\n\nFew people, even in this Hall, could find Sao Tome and\nPrincipe on a map. We are a small island-nation in the\nGulf of Guinea, off the coast of West Africa. We are\npoor. We are remote. Despite our isolation, my people\nface the same issues that confront every country in the\nworld today: first, how to protect innocent people from\nacts of terror, violence and mass destruction; secondly,\nhow to eliminate the grinding poverty that still afflicts\nand cripples half the world's population and affects\npeople in every country on Earth; and, thirdly, how to\nsave our environment and protect the world's natural\nresources from degradation and ultimate destruction.\nAs much as any people on the face of this planet,\nwe deplore terrorism. We condemn those who kill\ncivilians and target women and children, and we say to\nthem, `You are wrong to take the lives of the innocent,\nwhatever the reason, whatever the cause.' That is what\nmy people in Sao Tome and Principe believe.\nAnd so it is that last 11 September my tiny nation,\nwith its population of only 140,000 people, only a very\nsmall fraction of the population of the City of New\nYork, was horrified by the attacks on the World Trade\nCenter and the Pentagon. We send our condolences to\nthose in all the many countries who lost friends and\nfamily there. We join in condemning those who carried\nout these terrible acts. We call for their capture and\nincapacitation. That is what we feel.\nWe turn to the United Nations for leadership. We\nlook to the people in this great Assembly Hall to speak\nand to act for civilization, for freedom and for justice.\nAn American politician, Hubert Humphrey, said it best:\n`The heroes of the world community are not\nthose who withdraw when difficulties ensue, not\nthose who can envision neither the prospect of\nsuccess nor the consequence of failure, but those\nwho stand the heat of battle, the fight for world\npeace through the United Nations'.\nI commend the President of the United States for\ncoming to New York to consult and confer with those\nwho represent the community of nations. This act is\nconsistent with the finest and most admirable American\ntradition. If I can use Thomas Jefferson's words in the\nDeclaration of Independence of the United States, I\nwill say that President Bush's decision to address the\nUnited Nations on the subject of Iraq shows a `decent\nrespect for the opinions of mankind'.\nOn behalf of the people of Sao Tome and\nPrincipe, I declare our unconditional support for the\neffort to protect innocent people from acts of terrorism\nand to defend our populations from weapons of mass\ndestruction. The United Nations must lead the way. The\nnations of the world must act together as one. It is a\nmoral duty. Sao Tome and Principe offers what\nresources we have to assist in this noble effort.\nBut war and terrorism and violence are not the\nonly threats to the lives of our people. More insidious,\nmore pervasive and more deadly than even war itself is\nthe poverty that kills many millions of men, women\nand children needlessly every year. Poverty is silent,\nbut it is insatiable. It is unrelenting. I come from one of\nthe poorest countries in the world. We are grateful to\nall those who have come to us and have helped us since\nour independence on 12 July 1975. I take this\nopportunity to thank all of you.\nBut we cannot, and will not, continue as we are\ntoday, without clean water, without health care, without\nelectricity, without jobs, without schools and without\neven a primitive infrastructure or the capacity to build\none. Sao Tome and Principe cannot be left behind. We\ndo not want our neighbourhood in the global village to\nbe a ghetto slum. We want to be part of the information\nage. We want to receive, to learn how to use and to\nmaster the technology that brings enlightenment,\naffluence and opportunity. Many years ago, another\nbrilliant son of this country, the United States of\nAmerica, Abraham Lincoln, said\n`A house divided against itself cannot stand. This\nGovernment cannot endure permanently half\nslave and half free'.\nThe same can be said today about the rich nations and\nthe poor nations of our world. A house divided against\nitself  our house, this planet Earth  cannot endure\nhalf rich and half poor. We must do better.\nSao Tome and Principe now stands at a\ncrossroads of development. We are strategically\nsituated in the most important petroleum area in the\nworld today: the deep water off the western coast of\nAfrica in the Gulf of Guinea. With exploration success\nwould come enormous wealth and potential power to\nmy country. Sao Tome and Principe is therefore facing\na moment of opportunity that African nations rarely\nencounter, or have historically squandered.\n20\n\nJust 100 years ago, my people lived in slavery.\nWe picked cocoa off trees for the enrichment of distant\nEuropean landowners, while we lived in chains,\nwithout decent housing, education or even basic human\ndignity. But we have come far in a very short time. My\npeople are brave. We are strong and we are united. Sao\nTome and Principe led the way in Africa in September\n1990 in transiting from one-party rule to a multi-party\nsystem. My country is now a robust democracy, which\nenjoys some of the strongest stability in Africa. I am a\nproduct of my country's free and fair elections, having\nbeen elected just over one year ago, the second freely\nelected President since our independence in 1975. I\npromised my people that Sao Tome and Principe would\nbe a model for oil transparency and sustainable\neconomic development based on democracy, human\nrights, the rule of law and a diversified free-market\neconomy. We invite you to share with us in achieving\nour goals.\nI would now like to draw the attention of the\nGeneral Assembly to the following situation. We are\ntoday congratulating two countries on their entry as full\nmembers of the United Nations. But the task of\nachieving universalism in the United Nations has,\nunfortunately, still not been completed. I take this\nopportunity to pay special tribute to another country,\nwith a population of more than 20 million inhabitants,\nwhich has achieved admirable economic and social\nprogress through democracy, but which the\ninternational community continues to fail to recognize\nas an independent and sovereign nation. I am referring\nto the Republic of China on Taiwan. Sao Tome and\nPrincipe hopes, and urges, the Organization of United\nNations to resolve this case soon as a matter of justice\nand to declare and accept Taiwan as an independent\nand sovereign nation.\nHaving said that, I turn again to the United\nNations to say that the final challenge is perhaps the\nmost difficult challenge facing the Organization,\nnamely, to save the Earth itself. I appeal to those who\nfuel the factories of globalization and who drive the\nengines of progress and economic development. You\nare the ones who endanger the planet with your\npollution. You are the ones who cut down forests, who\nburn the fossil fuel, who poison the oceans, who\ndestroy the atmosphere and who warm the planet. You\nare the ones who can lead the world to develop cleaner\ntechnologies, more efficient uses of natural resources\nand effective ways to restore our land, air and sea.\nThere is no time left.\nThe people of Sao Tome and Principe live on two\nsmall islands in the Atlantic Ocean. If sea levels rise\nfrom global warming, my beautiful island home will\ndisappear beneath the waves. We know better than\nmost people that if we spoil our homeland we have\nnowhere else to go. We must live with the waste that\nwe make, and we cannot quickly grow back the trees\nthat we cut. If we cut down the trees that shade and\nprotect our food  the banana trees, the cocoa trees \nwe will starve. If we put poison in the water and\nchemicals in the earth, we will die. Whatever we do to\nbring prosperity to our land, we must do it in a way\nthat respects the water and air and flora and fauna that\nmake up our islands' environment. We must find a way\nto make progress that supports and sustains life rather\nthan destroying it. The planet Earth is like Sao Tome\nand Principe in that respect: it is nothing more than an\nisland in the universe. We must take care. We must do\nbetter.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the\nGovernment of the Republic of Malawi and on my own\nbehalf, I would like to congratulate President Kavan\nmost warmly on his unanimous election as President of\nthe fifty-seventh regular session of the General\nAssembly. I am confident that under his able\n28\n\nleadership, buttressed by a pragmatic approach to the\nproceedings of the session, we will be able to further\nconsolidate past gains on a variety of issues, and also\nmobilize renewed international resolve and political\nwill to reinvigorate our continued search for viable\nresponses and solutions to the many pressing\nchallenges that threaten the very survival of\nhumankind.\nI take this opportunity also to pay special tribute\nto his predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo of the Republic\nof Korea, for the able manner in which he handled the\nwork of the General Assembly during his tenure of\noffice.\nFurther, I would like to register my country's vote\nof thanks for and special recognition of the invaluable\ncontribution made by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, in injecting fresh impetus and a sharper sense\nof purpose and direction into the work of the United\nNations. His informative and insightful annual reports\non the work of the United Nations clearly point to an\norganization that is moving in the direction that it\nshould and is much more focused on the quest for\naccelerated growth and socio-economic progress of the\ndisadvantaged poor nations.\nA number of developments have taken place\naround the world since the last general debate. While\nsome of these are relatively positive and are, thus far, a\ncause for optimism, yet others, a majority, are, at best,\ndisheartening and tend to cast a long shadow on\nprospects for long term progress, especially in our part\nof the world.\nAs I speak now, for example, six southern Africa\ncountries, including Malawi, are in the throes of a\nsevere and life-threatening food crisis brought on by\ndrought-related deficits in grain harvests. Up to 13\nmillion people in Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique,\nSwaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe are facing severe\nfood shortage, which has already given rise to a threat\nof widespread famine and a rise in famine-related\nhealth problems. What we are clearly seeing here is a\nfurther deterioration in the general poverty situation\nand the humanitarian plight of the rural masses in these\ncountries. Chances of the food insecurity translating\ninto a serious region-wide security and health\ncatastrophe cannot be over-emphasized, especially\ngiven that southern Africa is already the epicentre of\nthe global implosion caused by HIV/AIDS. The current\nfood crisis in the sub-region stands out as the severest\nin many years. It is poised to inflict incalculable\ndamage on the social, economic and cultural fabric of\nwhole communities, and it endangers the efficacy of\nthe financial and economic sustainability of the\ninstitutional and public policy frameworks for\nsustainable development currently under\nimplementation.\nIndeed, southern Africa is facing uniquely\ndifferent multifaceted humanitarian crises arising not\nonly from civil wars, but also from social and\neconomic factors and other natural disasters. The crisis\nis certain to roll back numerous past gains in many\nsectors, particularly because of the centrality of\nagricultural production to the gross domestic product\nand rural employment of most of the affected countries.\nThe food shortage has placed further serious\nstrains on the already low revenue collection capacities\nof the affected countries, especially to the extent that\nbudgetary allocations are having to be appropriated\nfrom critical social sector services to fund massive\ngrain imports necessary to supplement inadequate local\ngrain stocks, thereby financially starving other equally\nurgent sectoral needs. Sadly, however, the next harvest,\ndue in eight months, may not hold much promise\neither, unless the drought cycle, which is the major\ncontributing factor, does not recur.\nInitially, Malawi faced a grain deficit of 600,000\ntons caused by two years of a paradoxical combination\nof drought and devastating torrential rains and floods.\nThis tonnage was urgently required to stave off a\nrapidly deteriorating famine situation that is expected\nto affect 3.2 million people. The President, His\nExcellency Dr. Bakili Muluzi, declared the current food\nshortages a national disaster on 28 February 2002, and\na vigorous national appeal for emergency relief has\nbeen under way since then.\nThe response to this appeal by the donor\ncommunity, both local and international, has been very\nencouraging. On behalf of the Government of Malawi,\nI take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude\nand deep appreciation to the local and international\nhumanitarian organizations and Governments, such as\nthose of the European Union, the Governments of Italy,\nthe United Kingdom and the United States of America,\nand other friendly Governments, which together have\nfinanced nearly 75 per cent of the emergency relief\nsupplies received so far in Malawi. We also wish to\nthank the United Nations funds and programmes for\n29\n\ntheir timely assistance, in particular the Food and\nAgricultural Organization of the United Nations, the\nWorld Food Programme and the Office for the\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), as well\nas resident United Nations agencies, for providing\nrelief coordination and procurement services during\nthis critical hour of need.\nIn a special way, and on behalf of the six\nSouthern African Development Community (SADC)\ncountries affected by the famine, the Government of\nMalawi wishes to thank the Secretary-General and the\nUnited Nations family for successfully organizing the\nConsolidated National Appeals for the Humanitarian\nCrisis in Southern Africa, which took place on 18 July\n2002, here at United Nations Headquarters. We are\ngrateful for the outcome of the appeal, and we would\nlike to extend similar sentiments of appreciation to all\nGovernments and donor organizations that made\npledges and commitments towards the funding\nrequirements of the appeal.\nIn addition, we welcome and applaud the\nSecretary-General's timely appointment of the\nExecutive Director of the World Food Programme,\nMr. James Morris, as his Special Envoy for the\nsouthern African humanitarian crisis. Mr. Morris's\npersonal meetings and consultations with the Heads of\nState and Government of the six southern African\ncountries and his tour of the subregion have led to\nuseful high-level exchanges that will form an important\nbasis for tackling the problem of food insecurity in\nfuture. We undertake to work with him and give him all\nthe support and cooperation necessary for the\nfulfilment of his mandate.\nThe high levels of poverty and the deepening\nscourge of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and other\ntransmissible diseases afflicting our people continue to\nravage populations in the developing countries,\nparticularly those of Africa. We take no relief from the\nannual reports for the year 2002 released by United\nNations Conference on Trade and Development and the\nWorld Health Organization, whose graphic statistical\ndata and hard facts portray an unabating, vicious and\ncomplex interplay between structural poverty and a\nstartlingly high HIV/AIDS prevalence in poor\ncountries. The resulting humanitarian crisis threatens\nmillions more lives over the next few years.\nAs home to one of the largest numbers of victims\nof the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the world, southern\nAfrica needs closer attention and concrete actions, as\nwell as deeper resource commitments by the\ninternational community, to help build sustainable\ncapacity to address the critical poverty issues and\nexcessive mortality from HIV/AIDS, malaria,\ntuberculosis and other diseases. These are extremely\nsensitive issues, and the international donor community\nshould consider, on an emergency basis, the difficult\nmoral issues and the choices involved.\nIt is extremely troubling that some Member States\nand donor institutions have suddenly taken a\nminimalist approach to the central role played by\nUnited Nations funds and programmes in tackling\nhealth problems in the developing countries. It is\nneedless to remind this Assembly that the work of the\nUnited Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in tackling\nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic, in the implementation of the\nProgramme of Action adopted at the International\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD)\nand in preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV/\nAIDS is very crucial. We call upon donors and\nmultinational institutions to reconsider their decision\nand to restore funding to UNFPA.\nFurther, we call upon multilateral donor\ninstitutions and industrialized countries to grant deeper\ndebt relief and forgiveness. Transnational\norganizations, which extract huge profits from their\nbusiness operations in poor countries, have the moral\nresponsibility to invest in HIV/AIDS prevention, care,\nsupport and treatment. International pharmaceutical\ncorporations, too, ought to show more compassion by\nexpanding access to antiretroviral drugs and other life-\nsustaining medicines, including meaningful\nconcessions on price reduction and voluntary\ndonations. We note with gratitude the positive steps\ntaken by some pharmaceutical companies in that\ndirection.\nMy Government acknowledges the important role\nplayed by the United Nations in mobilizing support and\nresources for the development process in the poor\ncountries. It is not enough, however, to hold one\nconference after another without effective follow-up\nand implementation mechanisms. There is therefore a\nneed for supportive global processes that would ensure\nshorter time lags between the adoption of programmes\nof action and their implementation.\nIt is our hope that the establishment of the Office\nof the High Representative for the Least Developed\n30\n\nCountries in the United Nations Secretariat will\npromote regular consultations and closer follow-up of\nagreed programmes of action to ensure their fulfilment.\nSuch programmes of action include the Brussels\nDeclaration and Programme of Action of the Third\nUnited Nations Conference on the Least Developed\nCountries, the International Conference on Financing\nfor Development and other commitments flowing from\nthe recent General Assembly special sessions on HIV/\nAIDS and children. An earnest attempt is necessary to\nlink up the commitments and agreed outcomes of the\nBrussels Programme of Action and the Monterrey\nConsensus in order to create a rich resource base for\nthe implementation of the Johannesburg Plan of Action\nfor sustainable development.\nOther major problems and challenges that are\nfaced by poor countries and stifle their progress have\npreviously been extensively covered and debated in the\nAssembly and in various other international forums.\nBut some of them need to be mentioned again. The\ntransition of poor countries from continued dependence\non international charity to self-reliance is contingent on\ncertain factors such as free and open trade. Agricultural\nand other commodities from developing countries need\nto gain access to Western markets without unnecessary\nbarriers. It is ironic and morally unacceptable that\nproducts from the West are freely offloaded onto our\nmarkets but not the other way round. Fair trade is a\ntwo-way transaction, and every endeavour must be\nmade to ensure that it remains so.\nOn an optimistic note, we welcome the\ncommendable progress that has been achieved in an\neffort to bring some conflicts in Africa to resolution.\nThis engenders the hope for the eventual restoration of\nstability and a chance for decisive peace on the\ncontinent. The ceasefire agreement reached on 4 April\nthis year in Angola and the peace agreement signed on\n30 July between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo represent notable historic milestones in\nbringing to an end the conflicts in the Great Lakes\nregion. I am confident that the United Nations will use\nthat opening to step forward, as it always has, to\nstrengthen its involvement and that of the international\ncommunity to consolidate those agreements and closely\nmonitor their implementation.\nI take this opportunity to congratulate the people\nand the Government of East Timor on their attainment\nof independence after many decades of dehumanizing\nsubjugation. My Government also welcomes East\nTimor's coming membership in the United Nations.\nIn the same vein, I congratulate Switzerland on\nits admission to the membership of the United Nations.\nThe significance of this historic development to the\nworld body cannot be over-emphasized, especially\ngiven the invaluable contribution the Government and\npeople of Switzerland have made over the years to the\nprogressive development of international humanitarian\nand human rights affairs.\nMy Government is concerned at the unrelenting\nbloodletting in the Middle East, particularly the\nsenseless carnage among innocent civilians. We\nencourage both the Israeli Government and the\nPalestinian Authority to give peace a chance through\ndialogue. We call, in particular, for the cessation of\nhostilities, provocation and incitement, which only\nserve to inflame the delicate conflict situation.\nMalawi believes in the principle of universality of\nhuman rights. One of the basic rights that every\nmember of the global community can expect to enjoy is\nthe right to freedom of association. It is on the basis of\nthat, and in a spirit of reconciliation, that Malawi\nbelieves that the United Nations should seriously\nreconsider the question of the readmission of the\nRepublic of China. The more than 21 million people of\nTaiwan should be allowed to freely participate in the\naffairs of the United Nations without any hindrance, as\nthat is what this Organization stands for. After all,\nTaiwan, through its rapid growth in the economic,\npolitical and social sectors has demonstrated that it has\na lot to offer for the good of humanity through the\nUnited Nations.\nAfrica is on the threshold of a new beginning\naimed at making a lasting clean break with the errors\nand political missteps of the last five decades. The\npromulgation of a development blueprint, the New\nPartnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD),\nprovides a very comprehensive, clear focused road map\nfor economic revitalization of the African continent.\nNEPAD, as a framework for development, contains\nbroad-ranging measures and actions that are reflective\nof a new vision for long-term development\nrequirements, as well as constructive and beneficial\nparticipation in regional, international and other\nmultilateral processes for effective integration of\nAfrica into the global political and economic order.\n31\n\nIt is gratifying, therefore, that the international\ncommunity is willing to support this newly emerging\npragmatic framework for partnership and ownership of\ndevelopment on the continent. I would like, once again,\nto encourage our development partners to join in and\nsupport Africa's new quest for economic recovery and\nsustainable development.\nIn conclusion, Malawi, along with other African\ncountries, would like to express deep gratitude to the\nleaders of the Group of 8 countries for voicing\nunequivocal support for NEPAD. We are thankful for\nthe creation of the Group of 8 Africa Action Plan\nadopted at the recent Summit in Kananaskis in Canada,\nwhich will operate as the platform for enhanced\ncooperation and partnership between Africa and the\nindustrialized Group of 8 countries. We are confident\nthat strong international networking and support for\nNEPAD will provide a solid basis for growth and\nprogress, as well as decisive peace and political\nstability in Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of\nthe delegation of the Republic of Benin, allow me to\nconvey to Mr. Jan Kavan our heartfelt congratulations\non his well-deserved election to the presidency of the\nfifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. His\nskills, his extensive experience in international affairs\nand his dedication to the lofty causes championed by\nthe United Nations guarantee the success of our work.\nI wish to assure him of my delegation's full\ncooperation and support in ensuring the full success of\nthe work of this session.\nI should like to take this opportunity also to\ncongratulate and to thank his predecessor, Mr. Han\nSeung-soo of the Republic of Korea, who presided so\nably and with such dedication over the work of the\nfifty-sixth session of the Assembly.\nI wish also to pay tribute to our Secretary-\nGeneral, Kofi Annan, whose devotion and skills have\nenhanced the prestige of our Organization.\nThe message that I bring the Assembly from\nBenin is a message of peace, which our people are\nexperiencing, and a message of the preservation of\npeace in all its aspects, in keeping with the Charter of\nour Organization and with the Millennium Declaration,\nin which we pledged to build for future generations a\nworld free from fear, hunger and ignorance.\n24\n\nThe barbaric acts perpetrated a year ago, on 11\nSeptember 2001 here in New York and in other places,\nare still vivid in our memory, making ever more urgent\nthe need to make greater strides in our common\nendeavour of civilization. The sincere and spontaneous\ncompassion and sympathy of the peoples of the world\nfor the victims of the terrible attacks of 11 September\nprove that more than ever before we are bound by a\ncommon destiny.\nIt is therefore vital to give real meaning to this\nsolidarity and this shared responsibility. The United\nNations must continue to play a dynamic role in the\npromotion of international cooperation in order to\nprevent and punish acts of terrorism.\nFor Benin, nothing \u2014 no pretext whatsoever \u2014\ncould justify such barbaric acts, and the terrifying\nimages that I am loath to recall today will remain\netched in our collective memory throughout the\ntwenty-first century. Benin's firm commitment to\ncombating terrorism is unambiguous, and we intend to\nfight this scourge with resolve.\nThus, pursuant to Security Council resolution\n1373 (2001), adopted on 28 September 2001, Benin\nsubmitted a report on the measures we have taken to\nprevent and punish acts of terrorism. A constructive\nand effective dialogue is under way with the Security\nCouncil Committee regarding proposed measures to\nprevent and suppress the financing of acts of terrorism.\nHowever, the anti-terrorist campaign will be more\neffective and more comprehensive if it is organized on\nthe basis of strict respect for the purposes and\nprinciples of the United Nations. We believe that there\nis an urgent need for a clear, precise, legal definition of\ninternational terrorism in order to prevent the\nhaphazard character of our individual or collective\ninitiatives from jeopardizing the effectiveness of the\nglobal coalition against the terrorist threat.\nBy placing Africa at the centre of its concerns for\nthe new millennium, the United Nations has rightly\nfocused the attention of the international community on\nthat continent, which, despite its commendable efforts,\nis having difficulty finding its way towards\ndevelopment. The persistence of war and conflict,\nwhich repeatedly lead to great bloodshed in that part of\nthe world, is one of the main reasons for that situation.\nAware that, as it faces new challenges, our\ncontinent is at a critical stage in its development and\nthat it is for Africa to shoulder its own responsibilities,\nAfrican leaders have taken a number of political\ninitiatives aimed at resolving conflict, rising to the\ngreat challenge of endowing Africa with new forums\nfor dialogue and action. This African renaissance, by\nmeans of which Africa is determined to take control of\nits own destiny and find solutions to its ills, should be\nencouraged through support for the African Union,\nwhich was launched in Durban, South Africa, in July\nthis year. The African Union espouses the vision of the\nfounding fathers of the African nations and of the\nformer Organization of African Unity. The African\nUnion is different from the Organization of African\nUnity because it stresses the need for the economic\nintegration of the continent and affirms that peace,\nsecurity and stability are indispensable conditions for\nthe creation of an environment conducive to\ndevelopment and that good governance must be the\nnorm for our States.\nI wish to reaffirm what many earlier speakers\nhave said: Africa is beginning to play its proper role. It\nlooks forward to a concrete demonstration of the\ngoodwill so often expressed by the international\ncommunity. It looks forward to real action in the form\nof deeds. We expect this for the New Partnership for\nAfrica's Development (NEPAD), for example.\nUnder the wise guidance of the President of the\nGeneral Assembly, we spent an entire day debating that\nAfrican Union programme. Relevant remarks were\nuttered, commitments undertaken and forceful\nstatements made from this very rostrum, and I do not\nneed to dwell further on that subject. Now is the time\nfor action, and time is of the essence.\nGlobalization must become synonymous with a\nbetter life for all the peoples of the world. The world\ncannot just stand by and watch the spectacle of an\nAfrica that has been marginalized and ravaged by wars\nand disease. Africa must not be an object of\ncondescension, as if the world did not have sufficient\nresources to avert catastrophe. I am sure that our\ncollective awareness is real and sincere.\nThat is why I welcome the timely initiative of the\nSecurity Council to establish an Ad Hoc Working\nGroup on Conflict Prevention and Resolution in Africa.\nWe hope that that initiative will demonstrate a genuine,\nongoing commitment on the part of the Security\nCouncil to act to put an end to the cycle of violence in\nAfrica, thereby according equal treatment to all\nhumanitarian crises without exception.\n25\n\nIn the context of collective efforts to consider and\ndeal with the question of conflict prevention and\nresolution through a comprehensive, integrated\napproach that takes into account political, economic\nand social dimensions, my delegation recommends\nreinforced interaction between the Security Council\nand the Economic and Social Council, in particular by\ndeveloping close consultations with the Ad Hoc\nAdvisory Group of the Economic and Social Council\non African countries emerging from conflict.\nOne of the most encouraging signs for Africa in\nrecent years \u2014 indeed in recent months \u2014 is the firm\ndetermination finally to put an end to fratricidal\nwarfare. We must support such efforts everywhere,\nincluding in Sierra Leone, Angola, Congo, Eritrea and\nEthiopia.\nI want to comment in particular on Sierra Leone,\nwhich has successfully emerged from a risky and\ndangerous electoral process. I would like to take this\nopportunity to pay a well-deserved tribute to the United\nNations and to the countries which, at the bilateral\nlevel, have been helping Sierra Leone to reintegrate\nitself into the community of nations. I hope that the\npositive evolution of the situation in that country will\nhave a ripple effect within the Mano River Union.\nI welcome the outstanding progress that has been\nmade in the process towards the restoration of peace\nand security in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nIn that respect, I would like to pay a well-deserved\ntribute to President Thabo Mbeki and to the facilitator,\nSir Ketumile Masire, for their commitment and\nperseverance.\nWe welcome the fact that the guns have now been\nsilenced in Angola after so many years of suffering,\ndestruction and privation. It is crucial to strengthen and\nconsolidate the peace process that is under way in that\ncountry. That is why I urgently appeal to the\ninternational community to provide support that is\ncommensurate with the enormous reconstruction needs\nof Angola. Only thus will conditions be right for the\nestablishment of lasting peace and sustainable\ndevelopment.\nI am pleased to note, among the initiatives to\npromote peace in Africa, the success of negotiations on\nan agreement on the demarcation of the border between\nEthiopia and Eritrea and the continuing dialogue to\nrestore peace in Burundi and the Sudan.\nIn January this year, 49 of the poorest countries\nof the world chose my country, Benin, to hold the\nchairmanship of the coordinating office for the least\ndeveloped countries. When we accepted that\nprestigious post, my Government was well aware of the\nheavy responsibilities that we were assuming.\nThe most important item on mankind's agenda\ntoday is sustainable development. Any progress \u2014 or\nany regression \u2014 must be assessed by the group of\ncountries that Benin is now coordinating. The\ninternational community itself recognizes that many\nproblems remain. The Third United Nations\nConference on the Least Developed Countries noted\nwith regret that previous goals had not been achieved,\nand it clearly identified the main obstacles to the\ndevelopment of the least developed countries. These\ninclude the continuing decrease in official development\nassistance, the debt burden, the difficulty of gaining\naccess to the markets of the developed countries and\nthe lack of foreign investment. By adopting a\nProgramme of Action and a Political Declaration at\nBrussels, the international community renewed its\ncommitment to helping the least developed countries\nresolutely to deal with mechanisms whose operations\nincrease poverty.\nMindful of the need to mobilize energy and\nincrease capacity in order thoroughly to implement the\nBrussels Programme of Action, the least developed\ncountries took the initiative of meeting at Cotonou,\nfrom 5 to 7 August 2002, in order to consider ways and\nmeans of ensuring the implementation of the\nProgramme.\nThe Cotonou conference formulated guidelines\nand made recommendations, contained in the important\nCotonou Declaration. At the national level, the\nDeclaration recommends the establishment of an\nimplementation and follow-up mechanism to monitor\nintegration of the Programme of Action into national\ndevelopment programmes and to promote the creation\nof a national forum for dialogue. It also recommends\nthat the least developed countries design their strategic\ndevelopment priorities in keeping with local contexts.\nThat is an important factor for guaranteeing rationality\nand national ownership of policies. At the international\nlevel, United Nations and other international agencies\nare called on to incorporate the Programme of Action\ninto their work programmes and Government\nprocesses.\n26\n\nI believe it important to call attention to the\ndangerous dwindling of resources available to the\noperational institutions of the United Nations\nsystem \u2014 particularly the United Nations Development\nProgramme, the United Nations Population Fund, the\nUnited Nations Capital Development Fund, the United\nNations Children's Fund and the World Health\nOrganization \u2014 and to stress the crucial need to find\nways and means of increasing those resources in order\nto strengthen these agencies' valuable efforts to combat\npoverty in our countries.\nThe Cotonou ministerial meeting also\nrecommended the establishment of a synoptic table to\nbe used by the Economic and Social Council when it\nreviews and follows up the implementation of the\nProgramme of Action by the least developed countries\nand their development partners.\nI wish at this point to reiterate our gratification\nand thanks to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the\ncelerity with which he implemented the decision taken\nby the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session to\nestablish the Office of the High Representative for the\nLeast Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing\nCountries and Small Island Developing States. The\nSecretary-General nominated Ambassador Chowdhury\nof Bangladesh to that important post, which he has\nalready assumed. In nominating Ambassador\nChowdhury, the Secretary-General could not have\nmade a more fortunate choice. We all know\nAmbassador Chowdhury and his great experience,\nresolve and dedication. His country, Bangladesh, has\nserved the group of least developed countries with\ndistinction for 20 years. I salute that work today. The\nSecretary-General and each one of us must now offer\nevery assistance to Ambassador Chowdhury and his\nOffice in becoming fully operational and in carrying\nout his important mission of obtaining the resources\nnecessary for action.\nTo that end, it is important that every Member of\nthe United Nations, even the poorest, make some\neffort, for example, by contributing to the Trust Fund\nto support the implementation of the Brussels\nProgramme of Action. The Government of Benin will\nassume all its responsibilities in that respect in due\ncourse.\nIn Johannesburg recently, at the World Summit on\nSustainable Development, the international community\nacknowledged its responsibility to the poor, the\nvulnerable and the marginalized as members of the\ngreat human family. It also recognized the need to\nconclude a world alliance for sustainable development,\nby which the developed countries would make the\nessential effort of solidarity with the poorest. A giant\nstep forward was taken there, but action is now\nrequired. We fervently hope today that all the measures\nadvocated in Johannesburg will become a reality. If\nthey do not, there will be no reduction, but an increase\nin poverty. We can stave off that danger, which is\ndeadly for all of us.\n\n\n\n"

Saint Lucia\nagain calls for the reformation of the global economic\ngovernance system to ensure that the planet's resources\nconstitute the common heritage of all mankind. A\ncorollary to global economic reformation is the\nequitable sharing of resources to ensure a decent\nquality of life for all and the redistribution of wealth\nand power at the systemic level to redress existing\ninjustices so that we no longer have a world with too\nmuch in one place and too little in another.\nA major impediment to development is the lack\nof transparency, accountability and democratic norms\nwithin the operations of the global governance\nnetwork. Saint Lucia has always upheld the democratic\nimperative within the domestic realm as the flagship\nfor the advancement of social progress and\ndevelopment. Saint Lucia reiterates that it is only\nthrough democratic participation and the belief that all\npeople are created equal and deserve equal rights and\nopportunities that the right of the peoples of the\ndeveloping world to true self-determination and\ndevelopment can be realized. It is only by upholding\nthe principles of transparency, accountability and\ndemocracy that the International Monetary Fund, the\nWorld Bank, the World Trade Organization and our\nown United Nations system can become relevant to the\ntask of solving the problem of global poverty.\nThe Doha declaration alone will not prevent the\nexclusion of States from economic decision-making\nand global governance. The non-involvement of\nGovernments in the development process runs counter\nto the original mission of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit.\nSaint Lucia challenges the United Nations system to\nraise its universal voice, in concert with the discordant\ncoalition, opposing any unilateral determination of the\nfate of the planet's natural resources and the billions of\npoor people depending on them for survival. Saint\nLucia calls for the democratization and reform of the\nWTO into an organization supportive of the sustainable\ndevelopment of all States. This is the only way that\ndeveloping countries can protect their interests within\nthe multilateral trading system.\nSaint Lucia laments the fact that the developing\nworld may have compromised its development agenda\nby signing the WTO agreements without the principle\nof special and differential treatment being an integral\npart of those agreements. This omission has to be\ncorrected in the Doha round. Why is it so difficult to\nunderstand that, given the critical nexus between trade\nand development, developing countries cannot be\nsubjected to the same expectations, rules and\nregulations that govern trade among developed\ncountries? The ideology of a level playing field is a\nmyth ill conceived. Equitable participation in world\ntrade demands that special consideration and assistance\nbe given to the developing world, particularly to\nvulnerable, small island States like Saint Lucia. We\nmust resist \u2014 and I underscore the word \u201cresist\u201d \u2014 all\nattempts to make the WTO a mechanism for unleashing\na silent economic war on the poor and powerless by\nprotecting corporate interests while marginalizing\nGovernments and people.\nWe need a Marshall Plan to address the terror of\npoverty and the stark disparities between the developed\nand developing world in trade technology, life\nexpectancy and illiteracy. Monterrey produced neither\na global development coalition nor a binding mandate\nwith targets and resources for implementing the United\nNations millennium goals of halving poverty,\neffectively addressing HIV/AIDS, closing the digital\ndivide and strengthening Governments. The message\nfrom Monterrey is that there is neither political will nor\nresources available for development. Of the estimated\n$55 billion required annually to implement the\nmillennium goals, Monterrey pledged only $5 billion\nover a period of three years. Further, official\ndevelopment assistance to developing countries has\ncontinued to decline from the United Nations target of\n0.7 per cent to 0.24 per cent.\nDespite the fact that debt servicing accounts for a\nnet transfer of resources from developing to developed\ncountries, draining a significant amount of\ndevelopment funds, Monterrey made no commitment to\nthe cancellation of the crippling debt of developing\ncountries. No attempts were made to stem the serious\nmarginalization of small island developing States or to\ngrant access to concessionary funding from\ninternational financial institutions for their\ndevelopment.\nSadly, Johannesburg was more of the same. The\nconference was convened to strike a global deal on\n8\n\nsustainable development, but failed to initiate the\npeople-driven process necessary to transform the\nglobal economic crisis into development for all. No\nmechanisms were established to insulate decisions\ntaken from being undermined in the current global\neconomic governance system. The failure of\nJohannesburg to establish an international citizen's\nagenda \u2014 with clear targets, resources and\ncommitments to implement development goals \u2013 that\nprotects the poor and the planet will reverberate\nthroughout the developing world.\nThe United Nations appears to have become\ncomplicit in its own demise, permitting the principles\nof universality and the quest for justice and equality to\nbecome obsolete. This institution was once the proud\nchampion of the redistribution of global economic\npower and the establishment of a new international\neconomic order. Today, however, in the major United\nNations institutions, such as the Economic and Social\nCouncil, the United Nations Development Programme\nand the General Assembly, there is a deafening silence.\nFurther, the gains made by the developing world\nwithin the United Nations are quickly being eroded.\nThe post of Director-General for International\nEconomic Cooperation and Development has been\nabolished. This was one of the few concrete outcomes\nof the developing world's thrust to secure a stronger\npresence in support of international economic\ncooperation. And the United Nations Centre on\nTransnational Corporations, which effectively tracked\nthe activities of transnational corporations in the South\nand their contribution to sustainable development, has\nbeen dismantled. Today, the market is left to determine\neverything, with corporate rule of the global economy\nresulting in untold havoc to the environment and the\npoor. No mechanism is in place to ensure corporate\nresponsibility and accountability.\nSaint Lucia urges the United Nations to\nreinstitute the United Nations Centre on Transnational\nCorporations. Further, Saint Lucia calls on the United\nNations to resist any attempt to weaken and\nmarginalize the United Nations Conference on Trade\nand Development.\nWhile development within the United Nations\nsystem is being undermined through the cutting and\nfreezing of the United Nations regular and core budget,\nthere have been substantial increases in the\npeacekeeping budget. Military spending \u2014 particularly\nthat of developed countries \u2014 keeps escalating, and the\nUnited Nations Development Programme and the\nBretton Woods institutions are being reoriented away\nfrom development. Development is in need of a global\ncoalition, without which we will pursue wars against\nterrorism in vain.\nSaint Lucia condemns terrorism in all its forms\nand manifestations. For small island developing States,\nhowever, security against terrorism and other threats is\nnot merely a matter of military spending, but is rather a\nmultidimensional concern encompassing matters such\nas drug trafficking and small arms, transnational crime,\nunemployment, poverty and underdevelopment.\nTherefore, whilst maintaining its peacekeeping\nmandate, the United Nations should not abandon the\nother mandates of its Charter \u2014 the economic and\nsocial development of all peoples \u2014 if it intends to\nremain relevant and credible. This institution needs to\nregain its balance and to listen to the fainting voice of\nhumanity in a universal chorus proclaiming global\npeace, justice, prosperity and equality for all.\nIt would be remiss of me if I did not at this point\nreiterate Saint Lucia's call for an end to the economic\nembargo on Cuba and for that country to be allowed to\npursue its right to the development of its people and to\nassume its rightful role within our hemisphere.\nIn closing, let me state quite categorically that, as\na vulnerable small island developing State, Saint Lucia\nis among those countries which require the support and\nprotection of the United Nations system and the safety\nof a strong, democratic and fair multilateral system\nmost of all. We appreciate the support received from\nthis institution and from friendly countries as we seek\nto advance our country's development. We also\nreaffirm our commitment to working with all Member\nStates to ensure peace, security and development for all\npeoples.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy delegation\ncongratulates Mr. Jan Kavan on his election as\nPresident of the fifty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly, and we thank his predecessor, Mr. Han\nSeung-soo, for his effective conduct of the fifty-sixth\nsession. We also pay tribute to the Secretary-General\nfor his enlightened and progressive leadership.\nIn addition, we warmly welcome Switzerland into\nthe family of nations, and we look forward with\npleasure to the admission of East Timor.\nWhen the fifty-sixth session of the General\nAssembly was convened a year ago, shockwaves were\nreverberating across the United States and around the\nworld as a result of the traumatic and cataclysmic\nevents of 11 September. My country's thoughts and\nprayers continue to be with the people of the United\nStates, especially those who have suffered irreparable\nloss. As the curtain rises on the fifty-seventh session of\nthe General Assembly, there is evidence that some dark\nclouds have lifted, thanks to the solidarity of the\ninternational community, which has galvanized into\ntaking action to prevent such dastardly and heinous\nterrorist attacks.\nNevertheless, there is a need for vigilance, as\ndemonstrated by the Counter-Terrorism Committee\ncreated to oversee the implementation of the landmark\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001). Grenada has\ngiven its full support and commitment to this resolution\nby using scarce financial and human resources to\nimplement security measures and new counter-\nterrorism strategies, including national legislation to\nconform with the resolution.\nIn this connection, we appeal for assistance from\nwilling partners in the fight against terrorism and the\nconcomitant trade in narcotic drugs and psychotropic\nsubstances that traverses our region via the Caribbean\nSea. This waterway must be maintained as a zone of\npeace in the context of sustainable development, free\nalso from pollutants and nuclear waste.\nThe general debate is taking place in the\ncontinuing shadow of 11 September, which has\nadversely affected the global economy and the social\nsituation in developed countries. However, the\n\n\nspillovers have affected, much more profoundly, small\ndeveloping countries such as my own. Particularly\nhard-hit has been the tourism industry, which is a major\nsource of foreign exchange. Tourist arrivals by air and\nsea have decreased significantly, due in large measure\nto increased security arrangements introduced in\ninternational transportation and, of course, the natural\nfear of travelling. Loss of revenue in tourism affects\nthe hotel industry, employment, transportation,\nbanking, agriculture and other tourism activities that\nhelp to sustain the economy of my country.\nThe next hardest hit sector is trade. Conventional\neconomic wisdom says that poor developing countries\nmust grow their way out of poverty. Trade offers the\nbest hope, because it is the engine of growth and\ndevelopment.\nMany products from developing countries face\nuntold obstacles in entering the markets of the rich\ndeveloped countries. In this connection, the decline in\ntrade, especially primary commodities, has a direct\nrelation on developing countries' ability to import\ngoods essential for development. According to the\nManaging Director of the International Monetary Fund\n(IMF), Mr. Horst K\u00f6hler, the true test of the credibility\nof wealthy nations' efforts to combat poverty lies in\ntheir willingness to open up their markets and phase\nout trade-distorting subsidies in areas where\ndeveloping countries have a comparative advantage, as\nin agriculture, processed foods, textiles, clothing and\nlight manufactures.\nGrenada fully understands the critical role that\ninternational trade plays in the alleviation of poverty.\nHowever, improved market access is a necessity for the\ndevelopment of smaller nations. We, therefore, reiterate\nour call to the more developed nations to make a\nconcerted effort to reduce trade barriers and tariffs,\nwhich impede poorer developing countries from full\nparticipation in the global economy.\nOne result of 11 September has been to further\nexacerbate the inequality between the developing and\nthe developed countries as trading partners in the free\nplay of market forces. According to the Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations Conference on Trade\nand Development (UNCTAD), the challenge now is to\nmake the multilateral trading system more\ndevelopment-friendly.\nNow, more than ever, the concerns of developing\ncountries, enunciated at the third session of the World\nTrade Organization (WTO) in Seattle and emphasized\nat the Fourth World Trade Organization Ministerial\nConference in Doha, should be the global agenda to\nfight poverty in developing countries. The Doha\nministerial declaration, adopted in November of 2001,\nreaffirmed the need for special and differential\ntreatment as stated in that paragraph 3 declaration:\n\u201cWe recognize the particular vulnerability of the\nleast developed countries ... we are committed ...\nto improving their effective participation in the\nmultilateral trading system.\u201d (TRADE/2002/1,\npp. 9-10)\nIn Grenada, our imports declined by 10.9 per cent\nin 2001, following a 20 per cent increase just the year\nbefore. Our exports performed even worse by\nregistering a 24 per cent decline in 2001, as compared\nto a 13 per cent increase the previous year. The effect\non our growth rate was not surprising. The economy\ngrew by 3.4 per cent in 2001, compared to 6.6 per cent\nin the year 2000.\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic casts a dark shadow\nover the General Assembly's global agenda. HIV/AIDS\nhas become not only a health pandemic, but also a\nthreat to the development of international peace and\nsecurity. This disease constitutes a global emergency,\nas it affects every country of the world; not a single\none is immune. The Pan American Health Organization\nhas reported that an estimated 2.8 million people in the\nAmericas are currently living with AIDS. Out of that\nnumber, 420,000 in the Caribbean are infected. The\nCaribbean is second only to sub-Saharan Africa in\nincidence and mortality rates.\nHIV/AIDS poses a drain on the scarce resources\nof the small economies, like Grenada's, whose\nrevenues have been further negatively impacted by last\nyear's horrific events. The Caribbean is facing a\nserious problem with the disease, and there is no way\nthat our small countries can stem the ravages of\nHIV/AIDS without a massive infusion of resources.\nThe Caribbean urgently needs financial and\nhuman resources for education and counselling in\npreventative measures and treatment, with respect to\nHIV/AIDS and the opportunistic diseases, such as\ntuberculosis and others. Moreover, the availability of\nmedicine and the ability to purchase it constitute the\ngreatest challenge.\n12\n\nWe applaud the establishment in 2002 of the\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.\nWe are also thankful to the Pan American Health\nOrganization and the World Health Organization\n(WHO) representative offices for assistance in the\nfacilitation, implementation and technical evaluation of\nmany projects in the Caribbean region. However, there\nis much more to be done, and the costs are\noverwhelming.\nThe World Summit on Sustainable Development,\nrecently ended in Johannesburg, and its precursor, the\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, held in Monterrey, and the conclusions\nof the Millennium Summit are all blueprints for\nsustainable development. The common thread in all the\nfinal documents is poverty eradication. Poverty, hunger\nand disease constitute a chain of misery with\ndevastating physical, mental and psychological\nconsequences.\nThe Secretary-General summarized the nature of\nthe challenges to human development best in the\nintroduction of his report to the Preparatory Committee\nfor the High-level International Intergovernmental\nEvent on Financing for Development:\n\u201cAs the new century dawns, there can be no task\nmore urgent for the United Nations than that\nfixed by the Millennium Summit of rescuing one\nbillion men, women and children from \u2018abject and\ndehumanizing poverty'\u201d. (A/AC.257/12, para.1)\nGrenada's stated position at the World Summit on\nSustainable Development is as follows: if sustainable\ndevelopment is to become a reality, our focus must be\non the health and social well-being of the world's\npeoples. Clean water, unpolluted air and food security\nare rights, not privileges.\nWhat is required now is not the elaboration of\nfurther final documents, replete with grand phraseology\nand pious pronouncements, but the implementation of\nthe existing ones that are most appropriate to the\nhuman condition. This brings to mind the need to\nimplement the Barbados Programme of Action for the\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates (SIDS) embodied in Agenda 21.\n\nWe are hopeful that there will be a comprehensive\nreview of the Barbados Plan of Action in 2004 in\nMauritius so that the difficulties that small islands face\nin the pursuit of sustainable development will be\nconsiderably reduced.\nAs a matter of urgency, the United Nations, its\nagencies and willing stakeholders and partners should\nseek to implement the first Millennium Goal: the\neradication of extreme poverty and hunger by 2015.\nGrenada awaits the time when the United Nations\nwill include the Republic of China on Taiwan in its\nmembership. The Government of Grenada has close\nand collaborative ties with the Republic of China and\nhas witnessed its economic achievements, seen\ndemonstrations of its democratic principles, and is\ncognizant of the dedication of its people to\ninternational norms and ideals. In this spirit Grenada\ncalls for the full membership of the Republic of China\non Taiwan in the United Nations. We are convinced\nthat the Republic of China on Taiwan meets the\nstandards for United Nations membership, since it has\na democratic Government and possesses the attributes\nof a nation-State. Indeed, the Republic of China on\nTaiwan has tremendous potential to provide inputs for\nthe further development of the international\ncommunity, as recognized by the World Trade\nOrganization.\nThe New Partnership for Africa's Development\n(NEPAD), conceptualized by African leaders and\nwelcomed at the Summit of the Group of Eight\nindustrialized countries (G-8), represents an idea\nwhose time has come. The international community too\nwelcomed NEPAD a few days ago, when it was\npresented by a high-level panel of African heads of\nState or Government during the present session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nImplementation of NEPAD in partnership with\nthe developed countries will mark the dawn of a new\nera for the economic development of Africa's abundant\nnatural resources. Thus, Africa, one of the largest and\nmost centrally located continents, can become the\nbreadbasket of the world. Grenada as part of the\nAfrican diaspora, hails NEPAD with great expectation\nand excitement.\nThe United Nations has the ability, with the\ninvolvement of its Members, to make a difference. It is\nthe international forum that struggles with and attempts\nto find solutions to difficult global problems. Grenada\nhas been watching closely the developments in\ninternational peace and security; economic\ndevelopment; social advancement and cooperation; the\n13\n\nfight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria and\nother threatening diseases; environmental\nsustainability; and a plethora of other regional, national\nand international issues.\nFor small countries such as Grenada, attending\ninternational conferences presents a paradox. We aspire\nto be integrally involved in these important\nconferences, yet financial constraints sometimes\noutweigh the benefits of being in attendance. Our\nabsence, as many other small nations would agree,\nshould not by any means be construed as a lack of\ninterest. Enormous expectations and optimism must be\nbalanced with a degree of realism. My delegation\nassures the General Assembly that it fully supports the\nefforts of the United Nations to face the many\nchallenges that arise.\nHowever, we must ensure that the many decisions\ntaken at the United Nations summit conferences are\nimplemented. But the goals must be achievable and\nbeneficial to all Member States.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe delegation of Cameroon welcomes the\nunanimous vote that conferred upon the Czech\nRepublic the presidency of the General Assembly at its\nfifty-seventh session. Current circumstances may not\nbe conducive to optimism, but the peoples of the\nUnited Nations are continuing to make progress\ntowards the future. The heads of State or Government\nof the countries of the world mapped out the contours\nof that future during the Millennium Summit. They\ncalled for a future world in which humankind can live\nfree from all fears and free from want. I am convinced\nthat, given your excellent qualities, Mr. President, you,\nlike your predecessor, will contribute to strengthening\ncohesion and peace among all States and peoples.\nCameroon welcomes the new additions to our\nfamily. Switzerland, our friend, has taken up the United\nNations banner, and the young Democratic Republic of\nTimor-Leste will soon be joining it.\nI should also like to pay tribute to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who, through his\ntireless efforts and commitment, is consolidating, day\nby day, the credibility and vitality of the United\nNations in the eyes of its Member States and, more\nbroadly, in international public opinion.\nThe United Nations, as never before, is a place\nfor coordination, research, action and vigilance in\nfavour of international peace and security. Our\nsteadfast and determined commitment against terrorism\nin the aftermath of the tragic events of 11 September\n2001 is proof of this.\nCameroon has acceded to the conventional\ninstruments adopted by the United Nations immediately\nafter that tragedy. We also associate ourselves fully with\nthe resolutions that are now enabling the gradual\nemergence of a new Afghanistan \u2014 one of liberty and\nmodernity for its people.\nThe fight against the destructive, indiscriminate\nand persistent evil of terrorism must be viewed in the\nlong term in each of our countries and be based on\ndecisions agreed to at the international level. That is\nwhy Cameroon fully supports the convening of a high-\nlevel conference to develop a joint response by the\ninternational community to terrorism.\nSuch a fight must not be merely a knee-jerk\nresponse. It will also require the adoption of a\ncomprehensive approach that takes into account all the\n32\n\nfactors of imbalance and injustice that can lead to such\ncriminal activity.\nIt is for that reason that President Paul Biya\nappealed to the community of nations\n\u201cto calm the international situation by doing away\nwith injustice, which can provide a fertile ground\nfor intolerance. Such a realistic step will enable\nus to eradicate the causes of dissatisfaction and\nrevolt that, if unresolved, can lead to despair and,\nat worst, to terrorism\u201d.\nIn the same spirit, we believe that our common\noffensive on terrorism must rest on legal measures\nagreed to by all States, as well as on the effective\nimplementation of commitments undertaken in the\nMillennium Declaration. We should recall that such\ncommitments are aimed at providing further solidarity\namong nations and at reducing the gap between rich\nand poor countries. Firmness without justice can only\npromote feelings of frustration and will leave the\nproblem unresolved.\nSince becoming a member of the Security\nCouncil, the pre-eminent body of our Organization, on\n1 January, Cameroon has made every effort to give\ncredence to the doctrine of a twin-track approach to\npeace and security. Combating international terrorism\nwill require the sincere and effective participation of\nall States Members of the United Nations. This in turn\nwill require an environment of peace, stability and\nsecurity among Member States. As a result, we must,\nwhatever the cost, find a solution to the conflicts and\ntensions that, in Africa, the Middle East and Asia,\ncontinue to drive fault lines through international\nrelations, among countries in the same region and even\nwithin certain States.\nAs with the fight against international terrorism,\nthe mobilization of the international community against\ncrises and armed conflicts must involve both resolute\naction and openness. Cameroon is especially concerned\nabout the delicate question of sanctions, which are\naffecting several countries. Sanctions must be targeted\nso as to spare innocent civilians, while the concerns of\nthird States, which can be indirect victims, must also\nbe taken into account.\nWe believe the Security Council would benefit if\nsanctions were viewed more favourably. This could be\nachieved by according them further legitimacy, which\nwould enable them to have the credibility essential to\ntheir effectiveness.\nAs for the institutional reform of the United\nNations, which Cameroon, like many other countries,\nhas been urging, special mention must be made of the\ninevitable expansion of Security Council membership.\nSuch reforms of the principal decision-making body of\nthe United Nations would permit a more integrated\napproach with regard to serious regional questions and\nthe multilateral challenges that flow from\nglobalization.\nCameroon is convinced that an overwhelming\nmajority of Member States are willing and able to carry\nout these reforms. That very ability and will have been\ndemonstrated by the establishment of the International\nCriminal Court; the first session of the Assembly of\nStates Parties to the Statute has just been held here.\nWe cannot overemphasize the need for solidarity\nto unify our nations. Support for the development of\nthe countries of the South must remain a priority, as\nmust synergy among our States in order to define a\nvigorous policy for environmental protection. We have\nnever had so many summits on these major challenges.\nYet it must be noted that we have seldom adequately\nmet the tremendous expectations of millions of women\nand children, the great majority of whom continue to\nlive in precarious circumstances and with great fear for\nthe future of the Earth.\nWe must ponder our failures. We must react with\na surge of voluntarism that will enable us to launch a\ndetermined attack on such great pandemics as\nHIV/AIDS. That is the path charted by the first ladies\nof Africa, who, upon the invitation of Mrs. Chantal\nBiya, will meet in Yaound\u00e9 on 15 and 16 November to\nestablish and launch, with the help of renowned\nresearchers and scientists, a non-governmental\norganization called Synergies africaines contre le Sida\net les autres souffrances. At that launching, Professors\nRobert Gallo and Luc Montagnier will moderate a\nscientific symposium on AIDS.\nIn order to combat fanaticism, we must cultivate\nfidelity to humankind. Such fidelity must be ongoing.\nAccording to a wise African saying, \u201cthe past and the\npresent become one in the single desire to preserve\nmankind\u201d. Today more than ever, it is our duty to\naffirm our fidelity to our peoples without ever\nforgetting the fundamental virtues on which the\nuniversal fabric of mankind's aspirations and dreams is\n33\n\nwoven. I recall that we have the urgent duty to forge\nthe future that was shaped by our heads of State at the\nMillennium Summit \u2014 a world in which mankind will\nfinally be free of fear, of all fears, and in which\nmankind shall never want.\nLet us build a dream together. Let us dream\ntogether of that future full of hope. We would remind\nthose who scorn such dreams that, in the beginning,\nthere was a dream. To them, we would reiterate George\nBernard Shaw's words:\n\u201cSome men see things as they are and say why? I\ndream things that never were and say \u2018Why\nnot?'\u201d\nIn the beginning, there was a dream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It is also a privilege for me and my Government\nto welcome and congratulate Switzerland on its\nadmission to membership of the United Nations.\nA year ago, the world was plunged into deep\nsadness as a result of gruesome acts of terrorism\ncommitted right here in New York City and elsewhere\nin the United States of America. In the wake of these\nbarbaric acts, we all entered a solemn collective pledge\nto battle terrorism wherever it may exist. Consequently,\nthere was not only a strong condemnation of terrorism,\nbut also firm support for the campaign against\norganized terrorist networks. We wish to reaffirm our\nsupport for Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)\nand the United Nations conventions and protocols\naimed at combating terrorism. The Government of\nLiberia has forwarded those conventions not yet\nratified to the Liberian National Legislature for\nratification.\nThe consolidated and coordinated response\nnecessitated by terrorist attacks requires a firm\ncommitment to ensuring the passage of comprehensive\nlegislations to meet the new dimensions of terrorism,\nthe adoption of strict financial control regulations to\ncurtail funding for terrorism, the strengthening of\ncustoms and immigration controls, the strict\nenforcement of laws regulating arms traffic, and the\nliberalization of the extradition conditions for persons\nsuspected of engaging in terrorism.\nIn the global war against terrorism, we must\nfurther act to combat the root causes of terrorism. This\nmeans that there is a need to take concrete steps to\ncombat deprivation, alienation, rejection, misery and\npoverty.\nRecent developments in the Middle East\ninvolving Israel and the Palestinians are a cause for\ngrave concern, requiring urgent and concrete actions to\nhalt violence in that region. Both the Israelis and\nPalestinians have justified claims, which must be\nresolved in a manner other than the use of excessive\nviolence. Violence cannot produce peace, neither can it\nbe an arbiter of claims.\nMy Government is in full support of constructive\nefforts that will help both sides to return to political\ndialogue in their search for a negotiated settlement. We\ntherefore urge all stakeholders and facilitators of the\nMiddle East peace process to undertake meaningful\nactions that will reduce the current level of antagonism\nand violence in the region and to avoid any further\naggravation of the situation in the Middle East. As we\nsay in Liberia, \u201cLet us not use fire to put out a fire.\u201d\nAt the formation of the United Nations 57 years\nago, most of Africa was still under colonial rule and\ntherefore Africa's participation in the creation of a\nglobal mechanism for collective security was limited to\nLiberia, Ethiopia, Egypt and apartheid South Africa.\nToday, Africa has formed itself into the African Union\nand represents over 25 per cent of the membership of\nthe United Nations. Despite this fact, and considering\nthat most of the conflicts under consideration by the\nSecurity Council are African conflicts, the continent's\nparticipation in the deliberations of the Security\nCouncil is grossly limited to non-permanent\nrepresentation with no right of veto. In essence, Africa\nhas no real voice in our world body even as it\ndeliberates on issues affecting our very existence as a\ncontinent. This situation must change. Africa's\ncontribution to collective security cannot be limited to\nparticipation in a debate that has no binding effect on\ndecisions taken by the post-war Powers.\nBuilding upon the Organization of African\nUnity's Mechanism for Conflict Prevention,\nManagement and Resolution, the African Union has\nestablished a Peace and Security Council to promote\npeace, security and stability in Africa, anticipate and\nprevent conflict, develop a common defence policy,\nand promote and implement peace-building and post-\nconflict reconstruction activities. That organ will\nprovide the capacity for the management of African\nconflicts by Africans and will thus form the initial\nbasis for Africa's contribution to collective peace and\nsecurity.\n18\n\nMany African States, including Liberia, have\nprovided peacekeepers to United Nations-mandated\npeacekeeping missions around the world. Africa has\ncome of age to contribute to international peace and\nsecurity, not only because Africa has the capacity to do\nso, but also, more importantly, because Africa is a\nprincipal stakeholder in international peace and\nsecurity. Liberia therefore calls for the permanent\nrepresentation of Africa on the Security Council with\nthe right of veto. This is the resolve of all Africans.\nThe Government of Liberia considers the present\nsanctions regime imposed on Liberia through Security\nCouncil resolutions 1343 (2001) and 1408 (2002) as\npunitive and unjust. Not only are the sanctions unjust,\nbut they have also created a grave humanitarian crisis\nthroughout the country. Although the Government of\nLiberia has always regarded as unjust, unjustified and\npunitive the imposition of United Nations sanctions on\nthe country, it has nevertheless consistently cooperated\nwith the Security Council, thus upholding that organ's\nintegrity.\nThe Government of Liberia is in full compliance\nwith the demands contained in paragraph 2(a) to (d) of\nSecurity Council resolution 1343 (2001). These\ndemands constitute the only conditions for the lifting\nof the sanctions on Liberia, as provided for in\nparagraph 6 of resolution 1408 (2002). Essentially,\nthese demands called for the cessation of support for\nthe Revolutionary United Front (RUF), intended to lead\nto progress in the peace process in Sierra Leone. In\norder to ensure compliance with these demands, the\nresolution imposed several punitive sanctions on\nLiberia.\nNo one can dispute the fact that peace has been\nrestored to Sierra Leone and that the RUF no longer\nexists. The defunct RUF has been demobilized and\ndisarmed by the United Nations Mission in Sierra\nLeone (UNAMSIL). The RUF was transformed into a\npolitical party, the Revolutionary United Front Party\n(RUFP), which contested the elections in Sierra Leone\non 14 April 2002. All Sierra Leoneans, including the\nRUFP, have accepted the results of the elections\nwithout any challenge to the democratically elected\nGovernment of Sierra Leone. The Government of\nLiberia was represented at the inauguration of the\nPresident of Sierra Leone and fully recognizes the\nGovernment of President Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah\nas the legitimate and democratically elected\nGovernment of Sierra Leone.\nLiberia is host to many Sierra Leonean refugees.\nThe policy of the Government of Liberia has been to\nencourage the voluntary repatriation of all Sierra\nLeonean refugees, in keeping with relevant\ninternational conventions. To this end, the Government\nof Liberia has facilitated the repatriation of Sierra\nLeonean refugees by the Government of Sierra Leone\nand the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), a process that\nis ongoing.\nSince February of this year, 12,500 Sierra\nLeonean refugees have been repatriated to Sierra\nLeone. Another 5,000 have registered for repatriation\nwith the embassy of Sierra Leone in Monrovia and\nUNHCR. At present, there are 25,000 Sierra Leonean\nrefugees still residing in Liberia under the care of\nUNHCR.\nHow is it conceivable that Liberia can today\ncontinue to be punished by the Security Council on\nallegations of supporting a non-existent RUF in a non-\nexistent war in Sierra Leone, while the Liberian\nGovernment provides protection for thousands of\nSierra Leonean refugees in Liberia?\nIt is conceivable because of the failure to\ndifferentiate between demands and punitive sanctions.\nThe condition for the lifting of the sanctions, according\nto the resolution, is compliance with the demands.\nHowever, the sanctions have not been lifted because\nthe focus is not on the condition precedent for its\nlifting, but on the sanctions themselves, as though\npunitive sanctions were ends in themselves. It is\nillogical to suggest that the condition required for\nlifting the sanctions is the sanctions themselves. To\nassert that would suggest that one would be rewarded\nwith a privilege if one refrained from exercising that\nprivilege. It is therefore confusing to speak in terms of\nalleged violations of the sanctions as though they were\nindicators of compliance with the demands, when, in\nfact, it is compliance with the specific demands of the\nSecurity Council resolution that constitutes the only\ncondition for lifting the sanctions.\nIn its last report on Liberia, the United Nations\nPanel of Experts rightfully raised the moral dilemma\nregarding the continuance of sanctions against Liberia\nwhen the war in Sierra Leone was over. However, that\nmoral dilemma was not a dilemma for those subjecting\nLiberia to unjust punitive sanctions, as morality had no\nplace in their political consideration.\n19\n\nIf regional peace and security are the objectives\nof the victimization of Liberia, how, then, do we\nexplain the conspiracy of silence surrounding the\nprevailing war in Liberia waged by externally\nsupported armed non-State actors? Can one reasonably\nexpect peace to be consolidated in Sierra Leone or\nmaintained in the Mano River Union region when\naggression against Liberia is left unchecked? What\naccounts for that conspiracy? Is it due to double\nstandards or to malice?\nThe current arms embargo imposed on Liberia in\nthe midst of a war waged against Liberia by externally\nsupported armed non-State actors has caused the\ndisplacement of a third of the population, resulting in a\nhumanitarian crisis in the country. The arms embargo\nhas encouraged the war against Liberia because of the\nperceived weakness of the Government to effectively\ndefend its territory. Furthermore, it should be noted\nthat the countries providing arms and ammunition to\nthe non-State actors operating in Liberia are in\nviolation of the arms embargo, and the Security\nCouncil cannot ignore their actions.\nThe arms embargo imposed on Liberia is a\nflagrant violation of Liberia's inherent right under\nArticle 51 of the Charter to defend itself against armed\nattacks. That violation has not only led to impairment\nof the Government's capacity to defend the nation; it\nhas also contributed to the resulting humanitarian crisis\nthat is the cause of immense human suffering in\nLiberia.\nThe combined impact of the sanctions and the\nongoing war in Liberia is telling on every aspect of life\nin the country. The sanctions have exacerbated the\nproblem of a fragile economy and have imposed\nsuffering on an already vulnerable population.\nAccording to statistics of the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the unemployment\nrate in Liberia is estimated at 85 per cent, while 80 per\ncent of the population lives below the poverty line.\nDonor assistance to United Nations specialized\nagencies and non-governmental organizations\noperating in Liberia has substantially declined since the\nimposition of sanctions.\nThe education and health sectors have suffered\nserious disruptions since the imposition of sanctions.\nOver 60 per cent of the children between the ages of 5\nand 14 years were in school in 2000, compared with\nabout 45 per cent today. Infant mortality and life\nexpectancy rates have significantly deteriorated. Infant\nmortality, which was 117 per 1,000 births in the year\n2000, is now estimated at over 130, while life\nexpectancy has declined from 54 to 47. Of the 16\nfunctioning hospitals and 25 health centres that were\noperating in the country in 2000, only 11 hospitals and\n15 health centres are still operating. At present, there\nare 59,370 persons per doctor.\nPrior to the sanctions, over 100,000 Liberians\nwere engaged in artisanal mining of diamonds, either\nas operators or labourers. Taking into consideration the\naverage size of the extended family, which is 7, that\nbrings the number of Liberians directly or indirectly\nimpacted by the Security Council ban on Liberian\ndiamonds to more than 700,000.\nA student at the University of Liberia wrote the\nfollowing in an assignment paper:\n\u201cThe United Nations euphemism \u2018selective\nsanctions' is a laughable oxymoron, if not a myth.\nThe attempt to strangulate and destroy the\nLiberian Government can in no way provide a\nfoolproof assurance that will guarantee the\nimmunity of ordinary Liberians from such\nstrangulation ... To regard the sanctions as\nselective, one should, firstly, bury his conscience\nto the plight of Liberians in their everyday living.\nSanctions are not selective when Liberians are\ndenied income and employment opportunities, or\nwhen primeval darkness cannot become obsolete\nin the face of modernity ... It is time, high time,\nthat the United Nations abandon its destruction of\nthe Liberian nation State.\u201d\nI join my compatriot in calling on the Security\nCouncil to bring an end to the suffering and\nvictimization of Liberians by acting urgently to lift all\nsanctions imposed on our vulnerable country.\nDespite the current state of emergency and\ncritical conditions created as a result of United Nations\nsanctions and the war waged by externally supported\narmed non-State actors, the Government of Liberia\nremains committed to democracy, the rule of law,\nrespect for human rights, national reconciliation and\nnational unity. To that end, a national reconciliation\nconference has been organized by a steering committee\ncomprised of persons representing a cross section of\nLiberian society. The first national plenary of the\nconference was launched on 24 August 2002. The\nconference was divided into five thematic subgroups:\n20\n\nfinance and management, culture and history, good\ngovernance, education and communication, and\nnational security.\nCurrent diplomatic initiatives undertaken to bring\nabout peace in Liberia are proceeding at two levels,\nthat of the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS) and that of Mano River Union,\nwhich are parallel processes. At the ECOWAS level,\nthe objective of the process is the facilitation of a peace\nprocess, especially with regard to bringing an end to\nthe activities of armed non-State actors, leading to an\nend to the ongoing war inside Liberia. At the Mano\nRiver Union level, the objective of the process is to\nbuild confidence among member States of the Mano\nRiver Union, the development of political will to\nensure good neighbourliness and the consequent\nimplementation of all decisions and protocols of the\nMano River Union, including those decisions taken\nsubsequent to the Moroccan initiative. His Majesty the\nKing of Morocco, who has maintained consultations\nwith the United Nations and major Powers, currently\nfacilitates that process.\nThose parallel initiatives complement each other\nand are not mutually exclusive. Settlement of the\ninternal conflict requires the cooperation of\nneighbouring States. The destabilization of Liberia by\narmed non-State actors and the resultant humanitarian\ncrisis have been and continue to be sustained by\nexternal support, and no internal settlement can be\nsustained in the absence of the cooperation of the\nneighbouring States of the Mano River Union and\nECOWAS. It is therefore important to encourage the\nMoroccan and ECOWAS initiatives as complementary\nefforts and not to perceive those efforts as working at\ncross purposes.\nThe restoration of peace and security to Liberia\ncan only be facilitated by ending the activities of armed\nnon-State actors, who sustain their activities through\nexternal support. That would, therefore, require, as an\nessential beginning, the cutting off of all external\nsupport to armed non-State actors. The achievement of\nthat objective will require that the Mano River Union\nmember States adhere to the Non-Aggression and\nSecurity Cooperation Treaty of the Mano River Union,\nimplement the 15th protocol to the Declaration of the\nMano River Union and implement all Mano River\nUnion decisions pursuant to the provisions of the 15th\nprotocol and those arising from the Moroccan\ninitiative. Fundamental among those decisions is the\ndecision of the Joint Security Committee, taken in\nConakry, Republic of Guinea, on 10 September 2001,\nregarding the endemic problems of dissidents. That\ndecision called for the apprehension and repatriation to\ntheir country of origin of all individuals, armed groups\nand other paramilitary forces involved in the\ndestabilization of member States.\nThe ongoing war waged by externally supported\narmed non-State actors against the democratically\nelected Government of Liberia is a result of the total\ndisregard and violation of the agreements and decisions\nof the Mano River Union. That war must be brought to\nan end. The decision of the Mano River Union on the\nendemic problems of dissidents was antecedent to the\nend of the war in Sierra Leone and intended to put an\nend to the destabilization of the region by armed non-\nState actors and to create a mechanism for sustainable\npeace and security within the Mano River Union\nregion. It is, therefore, imperative that no ambiguous\nsignals are sent to the armed non-State actors who are\ncurrently destabilizing Liberia; otherwise, the efforts of\nthe Mano River Union, the United Nations Mission in\nSierra Leone and the international community as a\nwhole to consolidate peace and security would be\nfutile, and would thus undermine the security of the\nentire region. It is, therefore, imperative that all armed\nnon-State actors be fully disarmed as an integral part of\nthe efforts of the international community to restore\npeace to the Mano River Union region.\nThe consistent denial of the United Nations to\nadmit the Republic of China on Taiwan into this world\nbody is a violation of Article 4 of the Charter, which\nspecifically states that\n\u201cMembership in the United Nations is open\nto all other peace-loving States which accept the\nobligations contained in the present Charter and,\nin the judgement of the Organization, are able and\nwilling to carry out these obligations.\u201d\nThe 23 million peace-loving people of the\nRepublic of China deserve to be represented in the\nUnited Nations. They have demonstrated their capacity\nand willingness fully to live up to the obligations of\nStates Members of the United Nations, as they have\ndemonstrated in other world bodies. It is therefore the\nconviction of the Liberian Government that the\nRepublic of China should be allowed representation\nand participation in this world body. The Liberian\nGovernment continues to hold the view that it is the\n21\n\nChinese people themselves, under the principles of\ndemocracy and of respect for human rights, who will\none day resolve the question of Chinese reunification.\nLiberia encourages the continuation of the cross-straits\ndialogue in the interest of the greater good of the\nChinese people.\nSome scholars are of the view that the calculated\nobjective of some sanctions is the achievement of a\nthreshold of domestic suffering that will cause the\npeople to rise up and overthrow their Government. If\nthis is true, then it is also true that some sanctions are\nnot intended to achieve compliance with United\nNations demands, but to precipitate regime change\nthrough rebellion against internal conditions of\nsuffering caused by sanctions. This may also explain\nthe indifference and insensitivity to the suffering of\npeople living in States under sanctions.\nIn the case of Liberia, the call for a study of the\npotential impact of sanctions took effect only after the\nimposition of sanctions, which gave an appearance of\nsome humanitarian concern for the people of Liberia.\nNevertheless, after 16 months of the application of\npunitive sanctions against Liberia, the Security Council\nis still trying to determine the impact of its sanctions\non our people. Will death represent an impact sufficient\nto bring about some form of moral consternation and\nrestraint? But for every day that a Liberian must face\nthe agony of sanctions, the integrity of the United\nNations is undermined and its conscience put to the\ntest.\nThe Liberian people consider their current\nsuffering at the hands of the Security Council a\nbetrayal of the dream and aspiration which inspired\ntheir forefathers to join in the formation of the United\nNations. With the benefit of hindsight, the Government\nwould have toiled in anguish as it participated in the\nSan Francisco Conference in 1945; not in doubt of the\nprinciples we ascribed to, but in fear of the potential to\ndistort those sacred principles.\nYet we remain resolute and true to the ideals and\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter, and we commit\nourselves to working with unrelenting perseverance for\nthe realization of peace, freedom, liberty and justice for\nall peoples.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me begin by taking this\nopportunity to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nunanimous election to preside over the fifty-seventh\nsession of the General Assembly. My delegation\npledges its full support to you and has full confidence\nin your ability to steer the session to a successful\nconclusion. I would also like to express my\ndelegation's profound appreciation to your predecessor,\n9\n\nHis Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo, for the excellent\nmanner in which he guided the fifty-sixth session.\nOur tributes are also due to the Secretary-\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\ntireless efforts to carry out the mandate of the United\nNations.\nNepal congratulates Switzerland and welcomes it\nas a new Member of the United Nations. We also look\nforward to having the privilege of welcoming East\nTimor as a new Member in a few days.\nWe are meeting here under the long and dark\nshadow of the terrorist attacks carried out against our\nhost city on 11 September 2001. The trauma and\ntragedy the attacks wrought are still fresh in our\nmemory. Our heart goes out to the children who lost\ntheir parents and to the families who lost their near and\ndear ones.\nItself a victim of terrorism, Nepal understands the\npain and peril terrorists brutally perpetrate on\nindividuals and societies. As globalization and\ntechnological advances have made it possible for\nterrorists to move people and funds across the world\nwith ease, the concerted efforts of nations will be\nessential to stamp out terrorism. We therefore support\nthe ongoing global war on terrorism and see the need\nfor better enforcement of existing international law and\nfor the conclusion of a comprehensive global\nconvention for that purpose. In Nepal we have enacted\na new law in this regard, as well as rules and\nregulations that include provisions of relevant\ninternational treaties to which we are a party.\nBeing opposed to democracy and freedoms, the\nso-called Maoist terrorists in Nepal have been taking\ninnocent lives, abducting children to work as child\nsoldiers, and destroying private homes, schools and\nvital infrastructure. In view of this, His Majesty's\nGovernment has recognized them as terrorists and has\nlaunched a campaign to protect people and property.\nWe appreciate the moral and financial support from our\nfriends in this effort. We also deplore any suggestion\nthat tends to equate the Government's obligation to\nprotect its citizens with the terrorists' dastardly acts of\nviolence.\nEven though terrorism is the menace of the\nmoment, other peace and security problems continue to\ntrouble the world. The Middle East is burning and\nAfrica is boiling over with conflict. Tension also\nabounds elsewhere \u2014 in Asia, Europe and Latin\nAmerica.\nTo find comprehensive peace in the Middle East,\nNepal supports the time-bound implementation of\nSecurity Council resolution 1397 (2002) and of the\nQuartet agreement of April 2002.\nIraq must comply with the relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions, and the international community\nmust respect the sanctity and integrity of the Charter of\nthe United Nations in order to avoid setting fire to the\nwider region.\nWe are happy that Afghanistan is limping back to\nnormalcy. Providing security coverage over the entire\ncountry should be the United Nations priority so that\nreconstruction can pick up momentum.\nEast Timor has emerged as a free South Pacific\nnation. We congratulate its people on their freedom and\nindependence, and the United Nations on helping them\nthrough the transition.\nIt is encouraging that Sierra Leone has achieved a\nmeasure of stability. In order to achieve a wider peace,\nattempts must be redoubled to resolve the conflicts in\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia and\nBurundi.\nThe Balkans, Cyprus and the Korean peninsula\nshould receive necessary support in their quest for\npeace and harmony.\nNo durable peace will be possible without the\nprevention of conflicts and the resolution of disputes\nthrough peaceful means. Peacekeeping, disarmament\nand confidence-building are the pillars of the edifice of\nculture of peace. United Nations peacekeeping\noperations have proved very useful in helping to\nstabilize fragile situations during and after conflicts.\nNepal is a major player in United Nations\npeacekeeping and has contributed more than 40,000\nmilitary and police personnel so far. Our peacekeepers\nhave served the United Nations with outstanding\ncompetence and dedication, sustaining 42 casualties in\nthe line of duty. Our commitment to United Nations\npeacekeeping operations remains robust. Supplying\nfully self-sustained troops is our goal, but that often\nbecomes difficult for a poor country. Until we achieve\nour goal, the United Nations must continue to bridge\nthe resource gap through innovative means.\n10\n\nIn our view, the total elimination of nuclear\nweapons in a time-bound manner constitutes the\ncornerstone of the disarmament endeavour. We also\nstress the imperative of observing existing international\ntreaties, ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty and concluding a fissile material cut-off treaty.\nNuclear-weapon-free zones and a guarantee not to use,\nor threaten to use, nuclear weapons against non-\nnuclear-weapon States, and other confidence-building\nmeasures will help the process of nuclear disarmament.\nEqually important is the need to eradicate chemical,\nbiological and other weapons of mass destruction.\nSmall arms have taken more lives than any other\ntype of weapons. We welcome the agreement that\nemerged from the United Nations Conference on the\nIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All\nIts Aspects last year. Nonetheless, we underline the\nneed for stricter controls on the possession of such\narms by non-State actors.\nUnited Nations Regional Centres for peace and\ndisarmament are an important tool for building\nconfidence and helping the process of disarmament in\ntheir respective regions. We are grateful to Member\nStates for having designated Nepal as host of the\nRegional Centre in Asia and the Pacific. It is, however,\ndeeply troubling that the Centre is yet to move to\nKathmandu, despite our full commitment to meeting all\nthose obligations that other hosts have met. We urge\nthe United Nations to relocate the Centre immediately\nand not to set terms and conditions over and above\nthose that other hosts of similar Centres have accepted.\nOne may argue that not all conflicts are products\nof poverty. Yet people living in poverty, deprivation\nand despair easily become susceptible to the evil\ndesigns of extremist elements. Hence, poverty\nreduction and sustainable development are an\ninseparable part of efforts to prevent conflicts and\nterrorism and to promote peace.\nIndeed, developing countries must bear the\nprimary responsibility for their own development.\nNepal has undertaken far-reaching reforms to liberalize\nthe economy, optimize internal resources, attract\nforeign investment and protect the environment. Most\nof its public expenditure is invested in people and in\npoor areas. Measures have been taken to provide clean\nGovernment and improve overall governance.\nHowever, our problems are so big and our\nresources so limited that without additional resources\nand market access we cannot accelerate our growth and\nsustain our development. Wealthy nations will\ntherefore have to fulfil their commitments made at the\nMillennium Summit, as well as at the Doha, Monterrey\nand Johannesburg conferences. We appreciate the\npledges of the European Union and the United States to\nraise the level of their development assistance and urge\nthem to keep their word.\nDeveloping countries also need a conducive\nglobal economic climate to grow. For that to happen,\nrich nations must strive to lift the world economy out\nof the current recession and agree on major reforms in\nthe international financial architecture.\nMore than others, least developed countries in\nAfrica and elsewhere need increased assistance and\nsupport to break loose from their poverty trap.\nDeveloped nations should do everything in their power\nto meet the official development targets, provide duty-\nfree and quota-free access for the products of the least\ndeveloped countries to their markets and help\nimplement other provisions of the Brussels Programme\nof Action.\nLandlocked developing countries suffer the\nconstraints of remoteness, high-cost economies and\nhigh transit costs. They need targeted assistance to\novercome their specific hurdles, as do the small and\npoor island developing States. Nepal appreciates the\nUnited Nations for its important role in propelling\ndevelopment in developing countries. We also welcome\nthe timely appointment of the High Representative for\nthe Least Developed Countries, Landlocked\nDeveloping Countries and Small Island Developing\nStates.\nRegional cooperation is a linchpin of attempts\ncollectively to foster competitiveness, capacity and\nsynergy. In South Asia, we are striving to build such\ncooperation under the South Asian Association for\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC). Poverty alleviation,\ntrade liberalization and technical cooperation have\nreceived the principal focus as precursors to the\nultimate establishment of a South Asian economic\nunion. The eleventh SAARC summit, which Nepal\nhosted in January, is a testament to member States'\neagerness not to let their political differences affect the\nprocess of regional economic integration.\nNepal is fully committed to democracy, justice\nand human rights, including those of women and\nchildren. We are strengthening the values and\n\n\ninstitutions of democracy and incorporating\ninternational human rights standards into our domestic\nlaws. Our National Human Rights Commission is fully\nfunctional and the judiciary is being revitalized.\nSadly enough, there are nearly 20 million\nrefugees around the world and many more internally\ndisplaced persons. In Nepal alone, there are over\n100,000 refugees from Bhutan, deprived of their\nhuman rights at home. With a view to finding a durable\nsolution to the problem, Nepal has engaged in bilateral\nnegotiations with Bhutan for nearly a decade now. We\ncall on Bhutan to take the negotiations as a matter of\nurgency and to pave the way for the earliest\nrepatriation of the refugees.\nFriendly countries, the United Nations system \u2014\nparticularly the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees and the World Food\nProgramme \u2014 and non-governmental organizations\nhave been generously assisting us in the maintenance\nof the refugees. We express our appreciation to them\nfor their help and urge them to continue it until the\nrefugees return home.\nCommitted to the principles and purposes of the\nUnited Nations, Nepal underlines the need for United\nNations reform, so that the Organization can meet the\nchallenges before it. Therefore, revitalizing the General\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council is our\npriority. We favour reinforcing collaboration and\ncomplementarity between the Economic and Social\nCouncil and the Security Council in their respective\nand related areas.\nIn our view, it is imperative to carry out a limited\nexpansion of the Security Council membership in both\ncategories, in a way that preserves the Council's\nflexibility and ensures equitable geographical\nrepresentation. Reform of its working methods must\nalso continue, with a view to enhancing transparency\nand improving the quality of consultations, particularly\nwith troop-contributing countries.\nReform is equally essential within the Secretariat\nin order to increase its efficiency and effectiveness.\nInter-agency coordination should also be upgraded.\nCentral to strengthening the United Nations are a\nvigorous Non-aligned Movement and a robust Group of\n77. As a member of both, Nepal pledges to work with\nother countries to reinvigorate those bodies and to\nexpand cooperation between them and the United\nNations.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the delegation of Laos, I would\nlike, Sir, to convey to you my congratulations on your\nelection to the presidency of this fifty-seventh session\nof the General Assembly.\nThe current session is taking place at a time when\nMember States have entered the third year of the\nprocess of implementation of the Development Goals\nadopted at the Millennium Summit. During the past\ntwo years, satisfactory progress has been made towards\nthose objectives, yet much more needs to be done. It is\nour view that the war on poverty deserves our greatest\nattention, for poverty causes millions of deaths and\ndoes not allow for sustainable development.\nFurthermore, our planet is facing the scourge of\nterrorism in its various forms. Our Government will\nwork in a spirit of solidarity with the world community\nin the combat against that scourge.\nSince the end of the twentieth century, it has been\nwidely claimed that globalization provides tremendous\neconomic and development opportunities to nations.\nHowever, it is evident that it has also brought\nnumerous challenges to the majority of the world's\npopulation, in particular to those people living in\ndeveloping countries. The most notable effects of\nglobalization can be seen in the fact that the disparity\nbetween the developed and developing countries\ncontinues to increase.\nAgainst this backdrop, while the developing\ncountries, with a sense of ownership and partnership,\nhave adopted various measures to cope with its\ndisadvantages, they still find themselves confronted\nwith the problem of securing financing and human\nresources that can handle new technology; added to\nthis is the inability to access the market of the\ndeveloped countries. Although the International\nConference on Financing for Development and other\ninternational conferences have given rise to some hope\nthat these disadvantages and challenges will be\naddressed, the results have been far from satisfactory.\nMoreover, the World Summit held in\nJohannesburg earlier this month failed to respond to the\nstrong aspirations of the developing countries and of\nthe world community in addressing the issue of\nsustainable development. Only by implementing the\ncommitments and pledges adopted at those\ninternational conferences can we ensure fair and\n5\n\nsustainable development and lasting peace for\nhumankind.\nWe continue to seek a world of peace,\ncoexistence and cooperation for development.\nHowever, to our regret, violent disputes and conflicts\ncontinue to rage in many parts of our planet due to the\nlegacies of history and other factors.\nWe are again gathered here in the conviction that\nthe United Nations, as the only truly universal\nOrganization, should have a greater responsibility and\na more important role to play, in accordance with\nCharter and international law, in resolving various\ndisputes in the world and in preventing the emergence\nof new hot spots and interference in the internal affairs\nof independent and sovereign States.\nWe should also continue to call for reform of the\nUnited Nations with a view to enabling it to rise to the\nformidable challenge of poverty eradication and the\npromotion of sustainable development. In particular,\nthe Security Council should be reformed so as to\nensure that it fulfils its responsibilities in safeguarding\npeace and security. In this context, I would like to pay\ntribute to the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, who has\nworked tirelessly to render our Organization more\neffective, and wish him even greater success in his\nendeavours.\nThe Lao People's Democratic Republic shares the\ninternational community's deep concern about the\nexcessive use of force in the Middle East since March\nthis year. In conformity with the common position of\nthe Non-Aligned Movement on the Middle East peace\nprocess, the Lao People's Democratic Republic\nbelieves that only a politically negotiated settlement\nacceptable to both parties and implemented under\ninternational supervision will bring peace, stability and\ncooperation to the region. Such a settlement must be\nbased on respect for the inalienable rights of the\nPalestinian people to establish an independent and\nviable State of their own, so that they can live side by\nside with Israel in peace and security within\ninternationally recognized borders, in accordance with\nall relevant United Nations resolutions.\nThe Lao People's Democratic Republic also\nexpresses great concern about the issue of Iraq \u2014 an\nindependent and sovereign nation, and a State Member\nof the United Nations. We are of the view that this\nissue should be resolved by the United Nations through\npolitical means.\nWith regard to the Caribbean region, the Lao\nPeople's Democratic Republic reiterates its call for the\nlifting of the economic, financial and trade embargo\nimposed against the Republic of Cuba by the\nGovernment of the United States of America. An end\nto this long-standing and obsolete policy would not\nonly mean effective compliance with various General\nAssembly resolutions, international law and the current\nworld thinking, but also promote economic prosperity\nand cooperation in the region as a whole.\nWith regard to the Korean Peninsula, the Lao\nGovernment welcomes the recent positive\ndevelopments, especially the inter-Korean ministerial\ntalks, as well as the preparation for negotiations\nbetween the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,\nthe United States of America and Japan. These\ndevelopments will help pave the way for the\nachievement of the goal of the peaceful national\nreunification of Korea, and significantly contribute to\nthe consolidation of peace and stability in East Asia\nand the Asia-Pacific region.\nWhile many other countries are taking advantage\nof the benefits offered by globalization, the landlocked\ndeveloping countries are still marginalized due to their\ngeographical disadvantage. Their lack of territorial\naccess to the sea, and their remoteness and isolation\nfrom major international markets, as well as the high\ntransit transport costs, continue to be major obstacles\nfor those countries in meeting objectives of national\neconomic development and poverty eradication.\nMoreover, this geographical handicap deprives us of\nour right to be competitive in the international trading\nsystem and to fully benefit from it. As the country\nholding the chairmanship of the Group of Landlocked\nDeveloping Countries, the Lao People's Democratic\nRepublic expresses its appreciation to the General\nAssembly for its decision, taken last year, to convene\nin 2003 an International Ministerial Meeting of\nLandlocked and Transit Developing Countries and\nDonor Countries and International Financial and\nDevelopmental Institutions on Transit Transport\nCooperation.\nOver the past year, the Lao People's Democratic\nRepublic has recorded a number of important\nachievements in the field of socio-economic\ndevelopment. One event of significance was the\nsuccessful election of the fifth National Assembly on\n24 February this year. This has contributed to the\ngradual improvement of living standards of the Lao\n6\n\npeople across all ethnic groups and ensured and\nstrengthened political stability and social order.\nWhile extending its cooperation to the\ninternational community in many spheres, the Lao\nPeople's Democratic Republic has contributed to the\nstrengthening of Asian solidarity and to the cause of\npeace, friendship, cooperation and development for\nnations throughout the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a great honour and\npleasure to congratulate the representative of the Group\nof Eastern European States on his election to the high\npost of President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nseventh session. On behalf of the delegation of\nUkraine, let me wish him success and assure him of our\nsupport. I would like to address words of respect and\ngratitude to his predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo.\nI would like to take this opportunity to convey\ncordial congratulations to a new, welcome Member of\nthe United Nations, the Swiss Confederation. We look\nforward also to welcoming the Democratic Republic of\nEast Timor as a Member of the United Nations shortly.\n18\n\nWe consider the joining of the United Nations by those\nStates a truly historic event which testifies to the\nviability of our great family of nations.\nThe first days of the fifty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly began with a commemoration of the\nvictims of the horrible terrorist acts of 11 September\n2001. Over the past year we have repeatedly reflected\non whether those events would remain a tragic moment\nin history, or whether they would prove to be a turning\npoint. We have been searching for an answer to a\nquestion representing the most difficult challenge to\nhumankind: how to preserve the fundamental right of\nevery person \u2014 the right to life.\nFor Ukraine, \u201cterror\u201d and \u201cterrorism\u201d are not just\nwords. For decades, the Ukrainian people lived under\nthe oppression of terror, which was raised to the rank\nof State policy. Next year Ukraine will commemorate\nthe seventieth anniversary of the induced famine which\nin 1932 and 1933 took the lives of over 7 million\nUkrainians. That most tragic event in our modern\nhistory, caused by the totalitarian regime, was a brutal\nact of genocide against the Ukrainian nation. At that\ntime the world failed to respond to our tragedy. Nor did\nit recognize early enough the face of fascism: certain\npoliticians and certain States thought that that evil\nwould bypass them. The consequences of that inaction\nturned out to be enormous.\nToday, at the beginning of a new millennium, I\nam confident that each of us would like to rely upon\nthe encouraging momentum of change which has taken\nplace in the international arena, and to rely upon the\nunifying force with which the world responded to the\nevents of 11 September 2001. In the face of the\nchallenge of terrorism, the international community\ndemonstrated its determination and resolve. Tangible\nresults have been achieved by the antiterrorism\ncoalition.\nWe regard the fight against terrorism as one of the\naspect of a broad and long-term process of\ncomprehensive international action aimed at abolishing\nthe philosophy of hatred and intolerance, which is\nexacerbated by conflicts in various regions of the\nworld.\nThe need for a new philosophy is particularly\nacute on the security front: success of the international\npresence in Afghanistan, the completion of the\npeacekeeping mission in East Timor and normalization\nin the Balkans are taking place alongside the dramatic\ndevelopments in the Middle East, the so-called frozen\nconflicts in the post-Soviet space, which remain\nunresolved, and persistent security problems in Africa.\nIn this context, the United Nations has no right to limit\nitself to passive observation and uninvolved analysis.\nAt the Millennium Summit, the President of\nUkraine, Leonid Kuchma, put forward an initiative on\ndeveloping a comprehensive United Nations strategy\nfor conflict prevention. We hope that ongoing\ndiscussions in the United Nations on the\nrecommendations made by the Secretary-General on\nthis issue will contribute to a real shift from a culture\nof reaction to a culture of prevention.\nThe United Nations is capable of utilizing its\nconsolidating force to strengthen the legal basis of\ninternational relations. We highly value the United\nNations contribution to this process that brought into\nforce the Rome Statute and led to the establishment of\nthe International Criminal Court. Today, it is highly\nimportant to ensure the effectiveness of the Court and\nto preserve the integrity of its Statute.\nAnother priority task in this sphere is to conclude\nthe elaboration of a comprehensive convention on\ninternational terrorism. This year Ukraine became a\nparty to the International Convention for the\nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings and the European\nConvention on the Suppression of Terrorism. Upon the\ncompletion of relevant domestic procedures on the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\nFinancing of Terrorism, Ukraine will be a party to all\n12 universal instruments against terrorism.\nA number of tasks facing the international\ncommunity in the social and economic spheres are\nfurther defining the role of the United Nations as a\nunique forum for dialogue among developed countries,\ncountries with economies in transition and developing\nnations.\nAs a member of the Economic and Social\nCouncil, Ukraine stresses the need for reform of the\nCouncil and for strengthening its coordinating role.\nThat process would, inter alia, significantly strengthen\nthe Organization's potential to ensure consistent and\neffective implementation of the provisions of the\nMillennium Declaration, the Monterrey Consensus and\nthe outcome of the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment, held in Johannesburg.\n19\n\nAt the Johannesburg Summit, the President of\nUkraine proposed the formulation of innovative\nfinancial stimulation mechanisms for developing\ncountries and countries with economies in transition, in\nparticular through debt-for-sustainable-development\nswaps. In our view, such steps would have a positive\nimpact on nations' rates of economic growth and\necologically responsible development.\nOn 31 December 2001 Ukraine concluded its\ntwo-year term of membership of the Security Council.\nAs a member of the Council, our country strived to\nmake practical contributions towards finding solutions\nto critical security problems in many regions of today's\nworld. Our country's position of principle is still that\nthe Security Council is the only organ with the\nlegitimate right to decide on the use of force, in\naccordance with the United Nations Charter. At the\nsame time we consistently stand for increased\ntransparency in the Council's work, and we hope that\nprogress on internal changes will allow the process of\ncomprehensive and long-awaited reform to start.\nAn important element of Ukraine's participation\nin United Nations efforts in the sphere of peace and\nsecurity will continue to be its contribution to\npeacekeeping activities of the Organization. We believe\nthat the key role played by United Nations\npeacekeeping operations and the personal contribution\nmade by each peacekeeper deserve adequate\nrecognition by the international community. I am\nconfident that everybody present in this Hall will share\nour view. At the current session of the General\nAssembly, Ukraine will present a draft resolution\nproposing annual observance of an International Day of\nUnited Nations Peacekeepers as a way to pay tribute to\nthe memory of fallen peacekeepers and to honour the\nparticipants in ongoing and past missions. We hope this\nwill be unanimously supported.\nUkraine views positively the advancement of the\nstabilization process in the Balkans, in particular in\nBosnia and Herzegovina and in Kosovo. Ukraine holds\nto a consistent position concerning the territorial\nintegrity and inviolability of the borders of the Balkan\nStates, and it fully supports the active involvement of\nEuropean actors in an effort to further normalize the\nsecurity situation in the region.\nIn contrast to a promising assessment of the\nsituation in the Balkans, we are compelled to voice our\nregret over the absence of progress in the settlement of\nother problems which are of particular interest to\nUkraine. Among them is the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict.\nThe absence of confidence between the Georgian and\nthe Abkhaz sides stands in the way of a renewal of\npolitical dialogue. As host country to the third meeting\nof the sides on confidence-building measures, which\nwas held in Yalta in March 2001, Ukraine stands ready\nto take practical steps, in cooperation with the United\nNations and other interested States, in order to renew\nthe spirit of Yalta.\nSpeaking of the situation in Georgia, I cannot fail\nto mention that Ukraine is deeply concerned at the\nsituation related to developments in the Pankisi valley.\nUkraine believes that the existing misunderstandings\ncan be resolved only through peaceful means, in\ncompliance with the norms and principles of\ninternational law. We call upon the parties to employ\nall available political and diplomatic mechanisms to\narrive at a mutual understanding and to take advantage\nof every opportunity to achieve d\u00e9tente in the current\nsituation. Ukraine unconditionally supports the\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia.\nThe situation in the Middle East also remains a\nsource of deep concern for Ukraine. It is quite obvious\ntoday that the parties have become trapped in a cycle of\nviolence, which contradicts the true aspirations of both\npeoples and breeds yet more hatred and desperation.\nWe fully support the efforts of the international\ncommunity, in particular the Quartet and the countries\nof the region, aimed at assisting the parties in finding\npeaceful ways to settle the conflict. Ukraine, for its\npart, strives to contribute in every possible way to a\npeaceful settlement. In April this year, during his visit\nto the region, President Leonid Kuchma presented\nUkrainian proposals in the framework of international\ndiplomatic efforts aimed at a peaceful settlement of the\nMiddle East conflict; these envisage a range of parallel\nsteps in the security, economic and political spheres. I\nshould like to take this opportunity to confirm\nUkraine's readiness to offer a venue on its territory and\nto provide all appropriate conditions for the conduct of\ntalks on this issue. The achievement of a final, just and\ndurable peace in the Middle East is not possible\nwithout the resumption of peace negotiations on the\nIsraeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese tracks.\n\n\nThe development of the situation concerning Iraq\ncannot fail to cause serious concern. We rely on the\npotential of the United Nations to solve this problem.\nThe resolutions of the Security Council should be fully\nimplemented. We expect that the new round of\nnegotiations between the United Nations and Iraq will\nhelp to find ways to resolve this issue.\nToday, the world looks with hope to the\nunprecedented integration process on the African\ncontinent. We hope that the birth of the African Union\nwill strengthen the spirit of African brotherhood and\nunity in responding to the numerous challenges that\nconfront the continent: armed conflict, poverty and the\nHIV/AIDS pandemic. Ukraine welcomes the African\nUnion's establishment and its far-reaching plans to\nrevitalize the continent. We hope that the New\nPartnership for Africa's Development will unite the\nnations of the world in a global partnership in support\nof peace, stability and development on the African\ncontinent. For its part, Ukraine is ready to continue to\nstrengthen its cooperation and expand its economic ties\nwith the countries of a united Africa, including in the\nframework of the new global partnership for the\ndevelopment of the continent.\nEnsuring the proper implementation of the\nprinciples of the supremacy of law, the creation of\nconditions for economic growth and the effective\nfunctioning of the institutions of an open society are\ngoals that remain fundamental in Ukraine's national\npolicy. The President of Ukraine has launched a\nprogramme of political reforms to ensure a transition to\na parliamentary-presidential form of governance. That\nprocess should bring about the further democratization\nof our society and should lead to consolidation of all\ndomestic resources in order to achieve European\nstandards and to strengthen concord in Ukrainian\nsociety. Our determined strategic goal is to become a\nmember of the European Union and of the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization, which should finally\nensure the indivisibility of the European political,\neconomic and security space. Our course of action is\naimed at making Ukraine a pillar of political stability,\neconomic prosperity and cultural renaissance.\nHere, I cannot fail to mention a tragic problem for\nUkraine that is related to the consequences of the\nChernobyl disaster. Our country must address \u2014\nvirtually on its own \u2014 a complex set of technological,\nsocial and economic problems connected to the\nmitigation of that disaster's consequences as well as to\nthe closure of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in\n2000. We expect that our efforts will be supported by\nconcrete action on the part of the international\ncommunity, in particular through the implementation of\nthe new United Nations strategy for Chernobyl.\nGuided by the aspiration to achieve practical\nresults, we are also determined to solve a broad range\nof other problems that have an important place on the\nagenda of the world forum. Undoubtedly, the fight\nagainst the HIV/AIDS pandemic is one of the most\nchallenging of these. I should like to inform the\nAssembly that a regional conference for the countries\nof Eastern Europe and Central Asia will be held in\nUkraine in November this year with the support of the\nUnited Nations and of other international partners.\nI am confident that, a year after the 11 September\ntragedy in the United States, each of us realizes the\nparticular significance of the tasks facing the United\nNations. Looking ahead to the new challenges, we hope\nthat, in the cause of protecting civilization's values, we\nshall be guided by our wisdom, which will allow us to\navoid tragic scenarios and to protect the rights of every\ninhabitant of the planet, including every new human\nbeing who comes into the world even as we speak in\nthis debate: the right to life, the right to dignity, the\nright to this world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is\ndifficult to come to New York at this time without\nrecalling the dreadful events of exactly one year ago,\nwhich brought the whole of the international\ncommunity together in support of this country, and this\ncity. On this occasion, we reiterate our solidarity and\nour conviction that the best way to cope with terrorism\nis within the multilateral framework, and above all here\nat the United Nations.\nI also take this opportunity to convey our\nappreciation to Mr. Han Seung-soo of the Republic of\nKorea for his excellent presidency of the last session. I\nwould also like to congratulate you most sincerely, Sir,\non having assumed the presidency of the General\nAssembly at this session. I have no doubt that your\nproven ability and recognized experience as an\nacademic, a statesman and an official in the Czech\nRepublic and abroad will enable you to guide our\ndeliberations successfully. We also congratulate the\nSwiss Confederation and Timor-Leste, the former one\nof the oldest countries in the world, and the latter the\nyoungest: one is now a full Member of the\nOrganization, and the other soon will be.\nI would like to address two subjects. The first is\ndevelopments within Guatemala, particularly regarding\nfulfilment of the peace agreements, in whose\nnegotiation and subsequent implementation the United\nNations played such a significant part. The second area\nI shall be addressing relates to our position on the most\nimportant items on the agenda of this session.\nOn the first subject, let me say that the past year\nhas been marked by intense activity in Guatemala.\nThere were important advances, but also some\nsetbacks. We confront an unfavourable international\nsituation that has had a negative effect on our economy.\nConditions have been made more complex by a severe\ndrop in the price of our traditional export products.\nUnusual rainfall patterns have affected the\nproduction of grain in several regions. I make these\npoints because it would certainly be easier to comply\nfully with the commitments contained in the peace\nagreements in a context of economic expansion, instead\nof having to do so in the face of serious fiscal\nrestrictions and increasing demands on our\nGovernment.\nYet we have made headway, even when we had to\ntake decisions that were politically unpopular but that\nwere necessary to attain the goals of the peace\nagreements. This was the case with our tax reform,\nwhich included an increase in the value added tax. That\nreform is already in force, and my Government has\nthereby fulfilled one of the specific commitments of\nthe peace agreements. This measure laid a financial\nfoundation without which the fulfilment of other peace\ncommitments and maintenance of macroeconomic\nstability would simply have been unthinkable.\nIt has fallen to me to preside over the first\nGovernment of Guatemala in the new era of peace. The\npeace agreements were our second declaration of\nindependence and they mark the road to building a\ntolerant and non-exclusionary society, a State that is\ndemocratic, participatory and where the rule of law\nprevails.\nDuring my administration public expenditure has\nfocused on education; but we also address, as matters\nof priority, access to land and the reduction of poverty.\nGuatemala is a country of marked contrasts between\nwealth and poverty. We labour under age-old\nconditions of injustice. We turned to the Government to\npromote reform for the well-being of our people,\nparticularly indigenous peoples, children, women,\npeasants and the victims of the internal armed conflict.\nReforms are essential in order to uphold democracy.\n8\n\nThere is powerful resistance to change, and this\ncarries political and even personal costs. But our\ncommitment to democracy, social justice and equity is\nunshakeable.\nThere are just too many things to do in\nGuatemala. After governing for three years, our\nawareness of what is lacking makes us feel dissatisfied.\nOn gender equality, we have made some progress on\nthe institutional plane, and we now, jointly with the\nwomen's movement, have forged an approach with the\neffect of State policy.\nWe are promoting educational reform, literacy\ncampaigns, scholarships for girls in the rural areas and\ncountry-wide nutritional programmes in schools. We\nare working also on poverty reduction strategies.\nThese are long-range policies, whose results will\nbe fully enjoyed only by later generations. The recent\nenactment of three laws  a reformed municipal code,\na law on development councils and a law on\ndecentralization  forms the basis for the most far-\nreaching reform of the State to have occurred in 100\nyears.\nThe peace agreements are comprehensive in their\nscope. We have promoted a substantive social agenda,\nand we have adopted measures towards free markets.\nWe have undertaken reforms in the area of\nsecurity, although much remains to be done. The\nmilitary is now focusing increasingly on national\ndefence. We have reduced the number of military\npersonnel as well as their functions, and some of the\nresources thus freed up will be been used for public\neducation and civilian security services. Military\nreconversion, however, will not be easy; we will have\nto make a special effort to achieve a smaller and better\nequipped army. Civilians are preparing to take over\nmore complex roles and society is being called upon to\nparticipate in elaborating important public policies,\nsuch as overall public security and national defence.\nWe are fostering dialogue with civil society on\nimportant issues such as agriculture and rural\ndevelopment, transparency, combating corruption and\nproviding compensation and reparation for victims of\narmed conflict. Our aspirations do not stop there,\nhowever. Guatemala has not yet achieved full\nreconciliation. We need to reconcile the elements of\nour society and provide opportunities for development\nwithout excluding anyone. Essential steps for achieving\nreconciliation include identifying all the parties to the\nconflict, making symbolic gestures to repair the\ndamage done, finding out and acknowledging the truth\nabout what took place, allowing justice a free hand and\npromoting forgiveness. Our nation has undertaken\nthese tasks in a diligent manner, although some\nuncertainty persists.\nMy Government's term of office will expire in a\nlittle over a year, by which time the United Nations\nVerification Mission in Guatemala (MINUGUA) will\nbe planning to withdraw. The Mission has played a\nfundamental role as the critical conscience of the State\nand has actively supported the fundamental changes\nthat have taken place. We appreciate the work that it\nhas done and we would like here to request the\nextension of its mandate to the end of 2004 so that it\nmay accompany us as we make the transition to a new\nAdministration. Our hope is that MINUGUA will hand\nover its functions in an orderly manner to national\nbodies and, where appropriate, to the programmes and\nagencies of the United Nations.\nLet me turn now to the agenda for this session.\nFirst of all, I would like to reiterate our full and\nunconditional support for the United Nations as the\nhighest form of multilateralism. We are convinced that\nthis Organization will have to play a crucial role in the\ntwenty-first century. We believe that the Millennium\nDeclaration provides an adequate road map enabling us\nto set out our priorities and the steps to be taken to\nfulfil the goals set. Its implementation has been given a\npowerful boost by the Monterrey Consensus and the\nPlan of Action adopted in Johannesburg a few days\nago. We also fully support the stewardship of the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan.\nWe agree that this Organization must adapt to the\nchallenges of globalization. We are aware that progress\nhas been made in this respect in recent years, but much\nremains to be done. In this context, we look forward\nwith great interest to the new reform proposals to be\nsubmitted by the Secretary-General towards the end of\nthe month. We pledge to participate actively in\nanalysing and debating them.\nFew would doubt that Security Council reform is\nthe most urgent of the outstanding reform efforts. We\nmust not delay our efforts to ensure that that organ is\nmade more effective, representative and transparent. To\nthat end, we advocate the expansion of the membership\nof the Council and believe that the veto power should\n9\n\nbe used strictly in conformity with the United Nations\nCharter.\nWe also believe that it is necessary to strengthen\nthe General Assembly and the Economic and Social\nCouncil so that the three principal organs of the United\nNations mutually support one another. We reiterate our\ntotal rejection of all forms of terrorism, and support\ncollective action by the international community to\ncombat that scourge through, inter alia, action in\naccordance with Security Council resolution 1373\n(2001).\nWe believe that we must strengthen our collective\ncapacity to prevent and resolve conflicts, whether of a\ntransboundary or internal character. With regard to\ndisarmament, we favour the complete elimination of\nnuclear, chemical and bacteriological weapons, an end\nto the illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons and\na ban on the use of anti-personnel landmines and other\nexplosive devices. We support all United Nations\nactions aimed at achieving such goals as well as at\nestablishing nuclear-weapon-free zones in all parts of\nthe world.\nWe believe in particular that the United Nations\nmust continue to address the development challenge.\nWorking with the multilateral financial institutions, our\nOrganization must play a crucial role in ensuring that\nthe benefits of globalization are widely shared among\nall countries. This will require common efforts within\ncountries and in the international community as a\nwhole. Furthermore, Guatemala is a party to the\nprincipal environmental treaties, and we reiterate our\ncommitment to maintaining the ecological equilibrium\nof the Earth.\nWe recently made a contribution in this respect\nby offering to host the headquarters of the secretariat of\nthe Convention for Cooperation in the Protection and\nSustainable Development of the Marine and Coastal\nEnvironment of the North-East Pacific. We participated\nactively in drafting that Convention.\nMy country is aware of the divisions between\nsister peoples in the Middle East, Asia and Africa. We\nfervently hope that it will be possible to resolve those\ndifferences by peaceful means through dialogue so that,\nwithout discrimination, all the peoples of the world can\nbe represented here. I would like to make special\nreference to the 23 million people of the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan, whose aspirations to participate in\nthe work of international organizations have not yet\nbeen fulfilled. The countries of Central America in\ngeneral, and Guatemala in particular, view those\naspirations as beneficial to global peace and\ndemocracy; they deserve our support.\nIt is likewise our earnest hope that a solution will\nbe found, based on security Council resolutions 242\n(1967), 338 (1973), 1397 (2002) and 1402 (2002) to\nthe difficult situation in the Middle East, which has\nworsened over the past year.\nFinally, we reaffirm our strong support for\nCentral American integration and our commitment to\nthe other countries of Latin American and the\nCaribbean. The Government of Guatemala has\nparticipated in important initiatives in the area of\nregional and subregional integration. In that\nconnection, I would like to point out that, in\naccordance with a constitutional mandate, Guatemala\nhas done its best to strengthen bonds of friendship and\ngood-neighbourliness with the State of Belize, without\nprejudice to the active search for a peaceful,\nhonourable, equitable and permanent solution to our\nterritorial dispute, which dates back over a century.\nOn Monday, 16 September, at the headquarters of\nthe Organization of American States, the\nrepresentatives of our two countries will be presented\nwith the conclusions and recommendations of a\nconciliation process that has taken place under the\nauspices of that organization. Any definitive settlement\nwill have to be approved by referendum in Guatemala.\nWe commend the solidarity displayed by the\nGovernment of the Republic of Honduras with a view\nto facilitating amicably the delimitation of the maritime\nareas in the Gulf of Honduras.\nIn conclusion, I would like to quote a Guatemalan\npoet, Otto Ren\u00c8 Castillo, who was a victim of internal\narmed conflict. Fifty years ago, he wrote:\nSmiles will return to the face of humanity,\nbecause children born in the twenty-first century\nwill be happy.\nOur mission must be to make this come true.\nSuch is the goal of our tireless struggle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish to join\nprevious speakers in congratulating Mr. Jan Kavan on\nhis election as President of the fifty-seventh session of\nthe General Assembly. We are confident that, with his\nexperience, wisdom and proven skills, our\ndeliberations will produce the desired successful\noutcome.\nLet me also pay a well-deserved tribute to his\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo,\nformer Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign\nAffairs and Trade of the Republic of Korea, for the\nexcellent manner in which he discharged his duties as\n21\n\nPresident of the fifty-sixth session of the General\nAssembly.\nI would also wish to commend the Secretary-\nGeneral for his continued devotion to peace and\ndevelopment worldwide. During his recent visit to\nMozambique, we had the opportunity to discuss the\nbest ways of furthering the goals of the United Nations\nand strengthening cooperation between Mozambique\nand the United Nations. We remain committed to\ncontinuing to work closely with the Secretary-General.\nThe Government of Mozambique welcomes the\nSwiss Confederation as a Member of the United\nNations and looks forward to welcoming the\nDemocratic Republic of East Timor. They will further\nstrengthen our universal Organization.\nAllow me to express our sympathy to the peoples\nand the Governments of several countries in the world\nthat have recently been hit by severe floods. We in\nMozambique and in Southern Africa understand the\neconomic and social consequences of floods. Floods,\ndrought and other natural calamities have become a\nfrequent occurrence in the world, and in Africa in\nparticular. It is therefore our hope and expectation that\nwe will be able to prepare ourselves to better deal with\nissues arising from natural disasters. Perhaps it is high\ntime we revisit the outcome of the 1994 World\nConference on Natural Disaster Reduction, held in\nYokohama.\nThe 11 September 2001 attacks demonstrated to\nall of us the dangers of international terrorism, which\nrepresents a serious threat to the peace and security of\nevery nation, rich or poor. In that regard, it is our\ncollective duty to fight this threat effectively, under the\nleadership of the United Nations. To be successful in\nthis endeavour we need to clearly understand and\naddress the root causes of terrorism, amongst which we\nwant to stress poverty and other injustices.\nIn addition to Security Council resolution 1373\n(2001), we must give due recognition to regional\nagreements and declarations to combat and eliminate\nterrorism, such as the 1999 Organization of African\nUnity (OAU) Convention on the Prevention and\nCombating of Terrorism, and the Southern African\nDevelopment Community (SADC) Declaration against\nTerrorism adopted by our heads of State or\nGovernment in January this year, as valuable tools for\nstrengthening cooperation and providing a platform for\neffective action to suppress terrorism.\nMozambique has already submitted its report on\nlegislation and measures for preventing and combating\nterrorism, and is in the final stages of the process of\nratifying all 12 conventions on terrorism. However, for\nthe effective implementation of these legal instruments\nMozambique needs support from the international\ncommunity to strengthen its institutions, namely the\npolice, the judiciary, the financial system and the\nAttorney-General's office.\nWe have witnessed this year the holding of a\nnumber of major United Nations conferences and\nsummits devoted to a wide range of socio-economic\nissues: the International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, the World Food Summit, the World\nSummit on Sustainable Development and the special\nsession of the General Assembly on Children. We have\nalso seen the holding in Barcelona of an international\nconference on HIV/AIDS, at which our leaders\nrecognized that this pandemic is a global problem\nchallenging our common will and requiring global\nresponsibility and response.\nThe common feature of all these events has been\nstrong and unanimous agreement on the need to ensure\nthe implementation of the agreed outcomes and\ncommitments in order to meet the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. Our leaders have stressed that for\nthis to happen, there is a need for unity of purpose,\ncollective responsibility and political will.\nWe should, continuously and critically, assess the\nprogress made in each area of commitment, with a\nview to realizing the aspirations and needs of our\npeoples. The future of the world is in our hands. We\nmust not fail to meet the expectations of our peoples.\nThe time has now come for action. We must act\ndecisively to honour the commitments made in the\nMillennium Declaration.\nMy Government has been following with keen\ninterest the latest developments in the Middle East. We\nurge both parties to return to the negotiating table to\nfind a lasting peace in that region; such a peace must\ninclude an independent Palestinian State living side by\nside with Israel, and the solution of outstanding issues\ndeemed important by both parties. Without a\ncomprehensive and just solution to the question of\nPalestine, and without full respect for the legitimate\ninterests of all the peoples of the region, the prospects\nof peace will remain elusive and distant. The\ninternational community should encourage both Israelis\n22\n\nand Palestinians to work hard for peace, drawing on all\nthe strength and resolve they need to overcome\nobstacles along the way. Taking into account our own\nexperience in Mozambique, we believe that peace is a\nreal possibility in the Middle East, and that the parties\nmust seize the opportunity now.\nI would like to take this opportunity to\ncongratulate the Government of Iraq on its wise\ndecision to allow the return of the United Nations\ninspectors. It is our hope that the resumption of the\ninspections will mark a new era of cooperation between\nIraq and the United Nations within the spirit and the\nletter of the United Nations Charter and international\nlaw.\nThis session is taking place at a moment when we\nare witnessing important progress regarding the\nresolution of conflicts in Africa. In Angola we have\nnoted with satisfaction the conclusion of a\nMemorandum of Understanding between the\nGovernment and UNITA, which marked the end of a\nprotracted war. We salute this Memorandum of\nUnderstanding and believe that it opens a new era for\nthe Angolan people: an era of hope and great\nexpectations. We appeal to the international community\nto continue supporting the people and the Government\nof Angola in the consolidation of peace and stability,\nnational reconstruction and the strengthening of\ndemocracy, as well as in responding to the current\nhumanitarian needs.\nSierra Leone is living in peace after the\nsuccessful implementation of the peace process, and\nfollowing general and presidential elections. We hope\nthat these positive developments will lead to the\nimprovement of the political environment in the Mano\nriver region as a whole.\nThe recent agreements between the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo and Rwanda, as well as the\nunderstanding between the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo and Uganda, have created the hope that the\npeace process will be irreversible. The attainment of\npeace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo will\nundoubtedly contribute to bringing about the needed\nstability in the Great Lakes region, and will pave the\nway for the rapid economic integration of Southern\nAfrica. We believe that with good will there can be a\nsolution to the concerns of all parties involved in this\nconflict.\nIn the Comoros and in Lesotho, peace is now a\nreality. We salute the efforts made by the peoples of\nthose countries to make Africa a continent of hope. We\nare happy to see Ethiopia and Eritrea working together,\nwith the support of the United Nations, to strengthen\npeace and good-neighbourliness. The acceptance by\nboth parties of the decision of the Boundary\nCommission was a major step forward.\nMy Government is concerned at the lack of\nprogress in Western Sahara. We wish to encourage the\nUnited Nations and the parties concerned to pursue\nfurther efforts, within the established framework, with\na view to finding a lasting and internationally\nacceptable solution to this issue.\nThe African leaders established the New\nPartnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) as an\ninstrument to address these problems. NEPAD is based\non the principle of African ownership aiming at setting\nan agenda to renew the continent and to encompass\nnational and regional priorities along with development\nplans. This is to be done through a participatory\nprocess and a new framework for interaction and\npartnership with the rest of the world.\nThe support already expressed by many partners\nof Africa is a signal that NEPAD is a viable initiative.\nIn that context, I would like to salute the encouraging\nresults of the Group of Eight Summit recently held in\nKananaskis, Canada, where the world's most\nindustrialized countries expressed their support for\nNEPAD. In the same vein, I salute the results of the\nGeneral Assembly's high-level meeting on NEPAD,\nheld in this Hall two days ago. These results enhance\nour hope of a better future for Africa. Let us work\ntogether to make it a reality.\nIn Mozambique, as part of efforts to fight poverty\nand to implement the Millennium Declaration, the\nGovernment approved, and is implementing, a Plan of\nAction for the Eradication of Absolute Poverty, locally\nknown as PARPA. The overall objective of PARPA is\nthe substantial reduction of absolute poverty in the\ncountry through investment in education, health,\nagriculture and rural development, as well as through\ngood governance and macroeconomic stability.\nPARPA is partially financed by savings achieved\nthrough debt reduction from our creditors \u2014 bilateral\nand multilateral \u2014 under the Heavily Indebted Poor\nCountries (HIPC) Initiative. We are thankful to all our\npartners for the debt reduction and the cancellations we\n23\n\nare receiving. Let us continue to work together to find\na definitive solution.\nThis session is being held at a particularly\nimportant moment in the history of Mozambique, given\nthat on 4 October 2002 we will celebrate the 10th\nanniversary of the signing of the Rome Peace\nAgreement, which marked the end of a devastating war\nof destabilization. Ten years after this historic\nachievement, the Mozambicans have kept the peace\nand shown that they can live together in harmony.\nGiven the historic significance of this date, we have\ndeclared it a national holiday: the Day of Peace and\nReconciliation.\nMozambicans are today enjoying the dividends of\npeace, which were achieved with the invaluable\ncontribution of the United Nations in what became a\npeacekeeping operation success story.\nTo consolidate this hard-won peace, we are\nimplementing home-grown development plans with a\nview to promoting the welfare of our people. We are\nalso strengthening democracy, governance and the rule\nof law, and preparations are under way for the\nforthcoming municipal elections in 2003 and the\ngeneral and presidential elections in 2004.\nIn my address during the fifty-sixth session of the\nGeneral Assembly, I spoke of the negative\nconsequences of the floods which affected\nMozambique during two consecutive years, 2000 and\n2001. Today, I am pleased to inform the Assembly that\nmost of the flood's victims have been resettled and are\nengaged in productive activities. Mozambique's\neconomy is gradually recovering from the scourge of\nthe floods, and, as a result of the hard work of the\nMozambican people and of adequate international\nassistance, my country achieved a growth rate of 13.9\nper cent in its gross domestic product last year and of\n12.1 per cent in the first six months of this year.\nThe report of the Secretary-General on assistance\nto Mozambique (A/57/97), which I commend, provides\na further account of the achievements recorded by the\nMozambican people in the process of national\nreconstruction and of economic and social\nrehabilitation following the floods of 2000 and 2001.\nThe 2001 Human Development Report gives additional\nevidence of the progress that has been achieved.\nI should like to take this opportunity to reiterate\nthe sincere gratitude of the people and the Government\nof Mozambique to the international community for its\ninvaluable support to the victims of the flooding.\nMozambique will continue to count on the international\ncommunity's support, in particular with a view to\nmitigating the effects of the drought that is affecting\nMozambique and other countries of southern and\neastern Africa, and in order better to prepare the\ncountry to face natural calamities.\nIn conclusion, I should like to reaffirm my\ncountry's faith in the United Nations and in its Charter,\nfor they remain the indispensable foundation of a just,\npeaceful and more prosperous world. We believe that\nthe current reform of the United Nations will help it to\nprovide better service to Member States, particularly\nthose most in need. We are convinced that the reform\nwill give rise to a stronger United Nations, with a clear\nfocus on developing countries and on results-oriented\nactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the\noutset, I should like to express my sincere\n4\n\ncongratulations, Mr. President, on your election to\npreside over the fifty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly. We are fully confident that your renowned\ndiplomatic experience will lead to the success of this\nimportant session's deliberations and to the adoption of\nresolutions and recommendations that are proportionate\nto the current international challenges. I should be\nremiss if I failed to express my appreciation to your\npredecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, for his tireless efforts\nto revitalize the role of the General Assembly. I should\nalso like to express, on behalf of the people and the\nGovernment of the Sudan, sincere congratulations to\nthe people and the Government of Switzerland on its\naccession to the Organization. In addition, I wish to\ntake this opportunity to congratulate, on behalf of the\npeople and the Government of the Sudan, the State of\nEast Timor on its coming admission as a Member of\nthe United Nations.\nA full year has passed since the deplorable\nterrorist events of 11 September, which terrified this\ncity, site of the Organization's Headquarters, where the\nflags of all our countries fly and where we meet to\ndeliberate on peace, security and justice. The\nanniversary of the World Trade Center tragedy is an\noccasion to strengthen international solidarity and\nresolve to combat terrorism, prompting us to reaffirm\nour conviction that terrorism is an elusive enemy that\nknows no religion, ethnicity or homeland. It is a\nchallenge that should be met with a collective\ninternational effort. The war on terrorism should be\nwaged with close national, regional and international\ncooperation and coordination, in conformity with the\nprinciples of international law and under the umbrella\nof the United Nations.\nThe Sudan, while reiterating its commitment to,\nparticipation in and support for the international\ncampaign against terrorism, would like to draw the\nattention of the international community to the feelings\nof anxiety expressed in various parts of the world at the\nderailment of the campaign, whose path and objectives\nare no longer on target, and at its manipulation by the\nforces of extremism and advocates of confrontation\namong civilizations and cultures.\nThe situation in the Arab and Islamic world in\ngeneral, and in the Middle East in particular, reflects\nthat anxiety and those feelings. Therefore, we in the\nSudan, current Chair of the Organization of the Islamic\nConference, reaffirm our rejection and denunciation of\nthat derailment and urge that the international\ncampaign against terrorism comply with the rules of\ninternational law. We strongly support the call of His\nExcellency Mr. Hosni Mubarak, President of Egypt, for\nthe convening of an international conference on\nterrorism.\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the work\nof the Organization, submitted to the current session,\nreflects the desire of the world's countries to strengthen\ncooperation, to alleviate poverty, to eliminate the debt\nburden and to resolve conflicts in order to create a\nworld of justice and equality, free of grievances,\ninjustice, hatred, bigotry, double standards,\nconspiracies and politicization, which run counter to\nthe noble objectives of protecting and enhancing\nhuman rights. Sudan reaffirms its firm conviction that\nthe United Nations remains the ideal mechanism for\nachieving international cooperation. Therefore, Sudan\nreaffirms its readiness to cooperate fully in all areas\nwith United Nations organs. Based on its conviction,\nSudan calls for the revitalization of all United Nations\norgans and urges that top priority be accorded the\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly in that\nregard.\nDuring the past year, Sudan's relations with the\nUnited Nations made great progress, a progress\ncrowned by the important and successful visit of\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan to Khartoum. The visit\nwas a good opportunity for him to see our country's\npositive development in all fields. The visit\nstrengthened the cooperation between the Sudan and\nthe international Organization. This year has also seen\nvisits to the Sudan by the Directors-General of the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the\nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization\n(UNIDO), the Organization for the Prohibition of\nChemical Weapons (OPCW) and the World Intellectual\nProperty Organization (WIPO). The Sudan is\nmaintaining good channels of communication and\ncoordination with the United Nations and its\nspecialized agencies through cooperation, on the basis\nof the fundamental principles of its foreign policy,\nincluding the principle of openness at the regional and\ninternational levels, and in consonance with its strong\ncommitment to active participation in all activities\naimed at carrying out the purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter.\nThe United Nations Charter calls for the\nimportant peaceful resolution of disputes and\nemphasizes the important role of regional organizations\n5\n\ntherein. The Sudan is currently presiding over two\nregional organizations, the Intergovernmental\nAuthority on Development (IGAD) and the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). In some\ncountries of these two organizations there are conflicts\nthat are the subject of much thought in the world today.\nIGAD is endeavouring to resolve the conflicts in\nSomalia and the Sudan. Through the OIC, whose\nmembership includes Pakistan, Iraq, Palestine and\nBosnia and Herzegovina, among 57 other countries\nforming almost one third of the General Assembly, we\nare sparing no effort to find solutions to serious\nconflicts at the national and regional levels.\nWithout resolving the root causes of the Arab-\nIsraeli conflict, by ending the occupation,\nimplementing lawful international resolutions,\nrestoring the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people,\nincluding its right to establish an independent state\nwith Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, peace, security\nand stability will not be achieved in this volatile region\nof the world.\nWe would like to stress the importance of a\npolitical settlement of the dispute between Iraq and the\nUnited Nations. In this regard, we would like to spare\nIraq and the region the risk of yet another war. As\nChairman of the OIC, the Sudan has initiated contacts\nwith the United Nations Secretary-General, the Foreign\nMinisters of the five permanent Security Council\nmembers and the Foreign Minister of Iraq; these efforts\nwere crowned with the unconditional acceptance by\nIraq of the return of the inspectors. We commend the\nbrave decision of the Iraqi leadership to allow the\nreturn of the United Nations inspectors and hope that\nthis will lead to the lifting of sanctions imposed on Iraq\nand the consolidation of its security, sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity so as to enable it to regain its active\nrole both regionally and internationally.\nThe birth of the African Union last year was a\ngreat African event, which renewed the aspirations and\nhopes of the continent for total liberation from the\nnightmare of conflict, poverty and underdevelopment\nin order to achieve solidarity, unity, security and\ncomprehensive sustainable development there. We look\nforward to working closely with the new international\norganization, the African Union, through the\nmechanisms established, such as its Peace and Security\nCouncil, so that we can coordinate the advancement of\nour continent through effective bilateral cooperation\nbetween the countries and effective regional\ncooperation with economic groupings and partnerships.\nIn this connection, the New Partnership for\nAfrica's Development (NEPAD) has emerged as\ntestimony to the ability of the continent to initiate and\ncoordinate initiatives among African countries. It also\nreflects the sincere desire of the continent for\ncooperation through this initiative, with its clearly\nstated socio-economic priorities. The various regions\nof the continent have also determined their priorities in\nthe fields of infrastructure, energy, environment,\ncommunications, education, health and primary care. I\ncall upon the international community to support\nAfrica through this new partnership so that it will attain\nits aspirations. We also call on Africa to speak with one\nvoice regarding the follow-up and implementation of\nNEPAD through the mechanisms of the African Union,\nour collective organization.\nWith regard to developments in my country, I\nhave the honour to inform you of the latest endeavours\nto resolve the conflict in southern Sudan. I would recall\nthat my Government has always considered the issue of\npeace and ending the war in the southern part of the\ncountry a priority and a strategic objective. This stems\nfrom our conviction that national peace leads to\nregional peace, which in turn leads to international\npeace, to which we all aspire. My country has spared\nno effort to find a solution to the root causes of the\nconflict. To that end, we have organized national\nconferences and meetings, and we have also responded\npositively to the various regional and international\nefforts aimed at ending the conflict. Against this\nbackground, and under the auspices of an IGAD\ninitiative led by Kenya and the efforts of\nintermediaries, the Government and the Rebel\nMovement have signed on 20 July of this year the\nMachakos framework agreement. This agreement was\nwidely acknowledged as a step towards eventual peace,\nsupported both inside and outside the country.\nHowever, the rebel movement has set that progress\nback with its insistence on military activities and on re-\nopening issues already agreed upon during the first\nround of talks. This regrettable development forced the\nGovernment to suspend the negotiations.\nMy Government believes that it is meaningless to\ncontinue military activities after signing the peace\nprotocol. My Government will continue to fulfil its\nresponsibility for protecting our territorial integrity and\nnational security and for seeking solutions to the dire\n6\n\nhumanitarian situation of our citizens affected by the\nmilitary activities of the rebels, as well as its\nresponsibility to secure peace and stability for all\ncitizens.\nWhile I am setting out the important political and\nconstitutional developments in my country, let me\nstress my Government's policy of consolidating\ndemocracy and promoting human rights in Sudan,\nparticularly after the positive steps taken in the areas of\npolitical freedom and freedom of the press. This course\nof action opened the door wide for the participation of\nall our citizens at the national level.\nSudan's foreign policy with regard to\ninternational and regional organizations has been\nguided by a clear vision based on well-defined\nprinciples \u2014 namely, openness towards others,\neffective participation in all international and regional\nforums and constructive dialogue based on objectivity\nand transparency. Inspired by these positions of\nprinciple, Sudan looks forward to playing a\nconstructive role on issues of regional cooperation in\nAfrica and among its neighbours. Sudan is well\nqualified to play such a role because of its unique\ngeopolitical situation and its human and natural\nresources. With this policy, Sudan's relations with its\nAfrican and Arab neighbours have witnessed\nsuccessful breakthroughs in economic cooperation,\nmutual trade and strategic partnerships.\nThe same applies to our interaction with the\nUnited States, which is now entering its third year. The\nAmerican-Sudanese relationship has witnessed some\npositive developments and our relations, which were\nruptured, have progressed to the point where the United\nStates is fully involved in efforts aimed at reaching a\npeaceful settlement in the Sudan.\nWe are fully cognizant of the political and\neconomic weight of the United States, as well as its\neffective role in all regional and international issues.\nAs such, we are keen to further enhance balanced\nrelations with the United States. Armed with faith in\nour just position with regard to the pending issues\nbetween the two countries, we remain confident that\nour relations with the United States will progress in the\nnear future and will be characterized by cooperation, as\nlong as both sides continue to remain committed to a\npolicy of dialogue rather than confrontation.\nWe are also confident that an in-depth dialogue\nwill lead us to consolidate trust between the two\ncountries in a manner that will spare us the bitterness\nof the past. The unfortunate case of the Al-Shifa\npharmaceutical plant, which was falsely alleged to\nproduce chemical weapons, bears witness to the\nsignificance of such a confidence-building process.\nThe end of the twentieth century witnessed many\nwars and conflicts that preoccupied the international\ncommunity. The negative impact of globalization\ncontinues to widen the gap between the countries of the\nNorth and the South. Although considerable progress\nhas been achieved in international cooperation thanks\nto qualitative improvements at the United Nations and\nthe commendable role played by its Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, some issues and challenges continue\nto preoccupy the conscience of the international\ncommunity. For this reason the reform process of the\nUnited Nations, especially as regards the Security\nCouncil, remains imperative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to thank you,\nSir, for giving me the floor. Allow me to congratulate\nyou warmly on your assumption of the presidency of\nthe fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly of\nthe United Nations. We have no doubt that your\nexperience, wisdom and infinite patience will lead us\nto a successful outcome of the work of this session.\nThrough you, allow me to congratulate Mr. Hans\nSeung-soo on his presidency over the fifty-sixth\nsession of the General Assembly, which he conducted\nwith skill and ability. I would also like to thank\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, who leads the\nSecretariat at a very delicate and difficult time in the\nhistory of the Organization, a time when it faces many\nchallenges, pressures and a serious situation of threats\nto international peace and security.\nI am honoured and pleased to congratulate our\nsister State of East Timor on its independence and\naccession to the United Nations, which represents the\nhope of all the peoples of the world to achieve their\nfreedom. I would also like to warmly welcome the\nSwiss Confederation, which has become a full Member\nof the United Nations.\nSince the convening of the last session, we have\nseen very important events in the international arena, in\nthe wake of the terrorist attack against the World Trade\nCentre in New York. That led to unprecedented\ncomplications in politics and international relations.\nThose political and social changes are accelerating and\nlead daily to new patterns of conflict.\nWith respect to combating terrorism, Qatar, as the\nChair of the ninth Islamic summit, called for an\nemergency meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference in Doha in\nOctober 2001. That Conference clearly condemned all\nacts of international terrorism, including State\nterrorism. It also affirmed the urgent need to agree\nupon an international definition of terrorism,\ndistinguishing between terrorism and legitimate\nresistance to foreign aggression and occupation for the\npurpose of national liberation and self-determination.\nI would like to recall from this rostrum that we\nare fully convinced of the validity of the United\nNations Charter and of the leading role played by the\nOrganization in the maintenance of international peace\nand security, as well as in ensuring the development,\nprosperity and dignity of humankind.\nHere, we have to refer firmly to the need for the\nwork of the Security Council to be transparent and the\nneed to renounce the selective implementation of the\nprovisions of the United Nations Charter. There is no\nescaping reviewing the permanent membership of the\nSecurity Council so that a select few will not be able to\ncontinue to use the veto, which can literally invalidate\nthe opinions of all others, while the United Nations\npreaches democracy, participation, justice and equality.\nThe practices of the Organization must be\ncompletely impartial. The needed measures for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security must\nbe applied to all without exception and without\npreferential treatment. We cannot allow the resolutions\nof the Security Council to be based on double standards\nor to be selective in a way that allows Israel not to\nimplement the resolutions adopted by the Security\nCouncil and the General Assembly.\nWe cannot accept that the people of Palestine and\nthe Arab people in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights\nand in the south of Lebanon are falling prey to the\nbarbaric aggression of the Israeli occupation forces\nbefore the eyes of the whole world and world public\nopinion. Israel violates the resolutions of international\nlaw, rejecting them without any reaction from the\nSecurity Council or any organs of the United Nations\nto put an end to it.\nWe observe closely and with concern the\ndeteriorating security situation in the Palestinian\nterritories and the blatant challenge to the international\ncommunity and international laws and norms posed by\nthe siege of President Arafat and the legitimate, elected\nleadership of the Palestinian people. We observe with\nconcern the assassination, abduction and arrest of\nPalestinian leaders, as well as the demolition of houses\non the heads of women, children and the elderly. We\nwatch closely and with concern the attacks on holy\nplaces, which have been condemned by all states and\nrepresentatives of international humanitarian\norganizations, including the International Committee of\n29\n\nthe Red Cross, which strongly deplored and\ncondemned those attacks.\nThe actions of Israeli forces in Jenin and Gaza\nand the massacres perpetrated there constitute blatant\nviolations of modern international humanitarian law,\ninternational human rights and international\nconventions, particularly the Fourth Geneva\nConvention relative to the Protection of Civilian\nPersons in Time of War of 1949. If it really intends to\nachieve security, Israel must take the route of peace by\nimplementing the resolutions of international law: the\nresolutions of the Security Council and the General\nAssembly. They all provide for the inalienable right of\nthe Palestinian people to achieve their legitimate\nnational aspirations, including self-determination and\nthe establishment of an independent State on its\nnational territory with East Jerusalem as its capital.\nThose resolutions also call for the withdrawal from the\noccupied Syrian territory of the Golan to the line of 4\nJune 1967, as well as from the rest of occupied\nLebanese territory.\nAmong the prerequisites required to ensure a\nprosperous life for humankind is the basic right to live\nwithout discrimination based on ethnicity, race, colour,\nideology, language, wealth or social origin.\nAs a people who believe in a revealed religion,\nwe believe in respecting human rights, because, in\naddition to our common laws, we have a divine law,\nlaid down in the Koran, that tells us to respect such\nrights. In Qatar, we protect and maintain human rights\nand have made them the standard for our religion and\nfor our progress. Many countries accuse certain\norganizations that profess concern for human rights of\nbias, selectivity and double standards because they\nconcentrate on political and civil rights without paying\nany heed to economic, social or cultural rights, which\nare no less important than civil or political rights.\nImportant as they are, civil and political rights may\nbecome devoid of content if we fail to pay heed to the\nother rights.\nQatar has made many advances in the protection\nof human rights, of the rule of law and of the principles\nof democracy and Shura, as well as good governance.\nWe have just completed a new national Constitution\nthat provides for public freedoms and free\nparliamentary elections. It also, for the first time, gives\nwomen the full right to vote and to be represented.\nWe in the Middle East are threatened by a clear\nimbalance of power. Israel is the only country in the\nregion that possesses an arsenal of nuclear weapons\nand refuses to accede to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We appeal to all\npeace-loving countries to demand that Israel accede to\nthe Treaty and submit its nuclear installations to the\nsafeguards system of the International Atomic Energy\nAgency.\nAt the present time, we see a positive direction in\ncertain international issues. With regard to the situation\nin Iraq, we welcome that country's acceptance of the\nreturn of international inspectors and its avowed\ncommitment to implement relevant Security Council\nresolutions and to resume dialogue with the United\nNations. We reaffirm the need to maintain Iraq's\nsovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and\nwe hope that resumed dialogue will lead to a\ncomprehensive solution and to a suspension of  and\nultimately an end to  the sanctions, which are\ncausing great suffering among the Iraqi people.\nAnother example of what the United Nations\nmust do to right current wrongs is the complete lifting\nof the sanctions imposed on the Libyan Arab\nJamahiriya, which has fulfilled its obligations and\nsurrendered the wanted suspects.\nAs we meet today, developing countries are\nexperiencing serious economic difficulties that are\nnegatively affecting their development in an\nenvironment of heavy foreign debt and declining\nofficial development assistance. They are also facing\nrestrictions on their exports to world markets and\nunfair prices for their basic commodities. Africa's\neconomic situation is still very serious, despite all the\nefforts of African countries and of the international\ncommunity to overcome that continent's development\nproblems. The economic situation is worsening, and\nforeign debt is increasing. Whatever economic gains\nare achieved must therefore be spent on debt servicing\nand on correcting the imbalance resulting from the\nreverse flow of resources. Africa is also the continent\nthat is suffering most from HIV/AIDS.\nWe support the efforts of the Secretary-General,\nand we greatly value his initiatives to reform the\nUnited Nations. With regard to the reform programme\nproposed in 1997 and approved by the General\nAssembly, we note with concern that its development\ngoals have yet to be achieved. We have witnessed a\n30\n\ncontinuous decline in financing that has led to the\nreduction of development programmes. We believe that\nthe Organization's socio-economic development\nactivities must be given highest priority, in accordance\nwith the principles and purposes of the Charter.\nWithout development, there will no lasting peace or\nsecurity.\nThe Millennium Declaration set out many\nobjectives, including that of achieving sustainable\neconomic development and, in particular, sustainable\nhuman development, with human beings as its crucial\nelement. Accordingly, human development is the major\ntopic of the high-level segment of the Economic and\nSocial Council's  current substantive session. The\nMillennium Declaration objectives of eradicating\npoverty, achieving economic development, halting the\nspread of HIV/AIDS and bringing that disease under\ncontrol by 2015 all require our concerted effort and\npolitical will. In addition, the voluntary contributions\nand direct financial investment flows of local and\ninternational donors are required to achieve the\nobjectives of the Monterrey Conference, the most\nimportant of which is the commitment by rich\nindustrialized countries of 0.7 per cent of their gross\nnational product to official development assistance.\nThose countries made the same commitment at\nprevious conferences. Here, I must mention the Doha\nConference in the light of the importance it attached to\nfree trade, market liberalization and infrastructure\nexpansion in increasing the competitive ability of\ndeveloping countries, in particular African countries.\nThat Conference also emphasized the importance of the\ntransfer of information and communications\ntechnology, economic diversity, foreign trade and\nincreased market access, as well as increasing flows of\nforeign resources and reducing debt.\nQatar has always opposed coercive, unilateral\nsanctions imposed by one single country on another\nsovereign country over which it has no legal\njurisdiction. We believe that imposing sanctions on\nother countries with a view to serving economic\ninterests or achieving political objectives represents a\nviolation of the principles of equal sovereignty among\nstates and self-determination, as provided for by the\nCharter of the United Nations and relevant United\nNations resolutions. Therefore, Qatar reaffirms its\ncategorical rejection of all attempts to implement local\nlaws across borders on the citizens and companies of\nother States to force those countries to comply with\nunilateral economic measures that transcend the legal\njurisdiction of States. That is in direct violation of\ninternational law, of the provisions of the Charter and\nof the rules of the World Trade Organization.\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in\nthe general debate for this meeting."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to join in thanking\nthe outgoing President of the General Assembly for the\ndiligent manner in which he managed the affairs of the\nAssembly. I would also like to congratulate you,\nMr. President, for taking over the leadership of the\nAssembly at its fifty-seventh session. We hope that you\nwill have a successful tenure in your stewardship of\nthis important body.\nAllow us to also welcome Switzerland and East\nTimor to membership of the United Nations.\nTwo years ago, the world's political leaders met\nat this place and, through the historic United Nations\nMillennium Declaration, reaffirmed our faith in the\nUnited Nations Organization and its Charter as\nindispensable foundations of a more peaceful,\nprosperous and just world. That an unprecedented\nnumber of heads of State and Government had gathered\nat the United Nations to make that commitment to\ncooperation among the peoples of the world \u2014 to\npeace, prosperity and justice throughout our\nuniverse \u2014 gave hope to the billions throughout the\nworld who know the painful meaning of oppression by\n10\n\nanother, of war and violent conflict, of poverty and\ninjustice.\nNone of those who spoke from this podium knew\nthat a year after they had pledged to use their energies\nand talents to provide a meaningful life for all, peace in\nthis country and the rest of the world would be brutally\nchallenged by the murderous terrorist attack of 11\nSeptember. We meet a day after the anniversary of that\nfateful 11 September. We have a collective duty to\nreaffirm our united resolve to create a world free of the\nfear of terrorism. We have a common task to ensure\nthat this Organization truly lives up to its obligations to\ndo all the things that make for peace. We have a solemn\nobligation to give real meaning to the message of hope\nwe proclaimed in the Millennium Declaration. It may\nbe that future generations will say that if we have\nlearned anything at all from the horrendous events of\n11 September, it is that the General Assembly should\ndedicate its efforts to the accomplishment of these\ntasks.\nIn keeping with that perspective, we have come to\nthe fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly to\nreport that the peoples of Africa have risen to those\nchallenges by forming the African Union. Our Union is\nbased on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the\nUnited Nations. It results from the transformation of\nthe Organization of African Unity, which championed\nthe cause of the unity and independence of Africa for\nnearly 40 years. The African Union is Africa's\npractical and determined response to its past and\npresent, in favour of peace and stability, democracy\nand human rights, cooperation, development,\nprosperity and human dignity. Its programme for the\nsocio-economic revitalization of our continent is the\nNew Partnership for Africa's Development, which must\nhelp us to eradicate poverty and underdevelopment\nthroughout Africa and, within the context of the\nAfrican Union, end Africa's humiliation as an object of\ncharity.\nClearly, the objectives of the African Union and\nthe programme enunciated in the New Partnership\nessentially, and of necessity, seek to advance the aims\ncontained in the Millennium Development Goals.\nNaturally, the United Nations \u2014 as an Organization\nseized of the task to address the critical issues of peace,\nhuman rights and poverty eradication within the\nframework of sustainable development \u2014 will forever\nbe central to the success of the African Union and the\naccomplishment of the goals of the New Partnership\nfor Africa's Development. Accordingly, on behalf of\nthe united peoples of Africa, we are honoured and\nprivileged to commend to this Organization both the\nAfrican Union and the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment. We are convinced that with the support\nof the United Nations, we will transform this into an\nAfrican century.\nWe are happy that there are encouraging peace\nprocesses in Angola, Burundi, the Democratic Republic\nof the Congo and the Sudan, with the Comoros already\nhaving held successful elections. We are particularly\npleased because these positive developments will\ncreate the possibility for millions of our fellow\nAfricans to reaffirm the sanctity of human life and\nsecurity and to engage in the important tasks of\nrebuilding their countries to bring about a better life for\nall.\nAs part of our commitment to wage a sustained\nstruggle to realize the long-deferred hopes of the\npeoples of Africa, we have agreed to the establishment\nof various institutions, including a peer-review\nmechanism, which must help us ensure that we honour\nour commitments to democracy, human rights and good\ngovernance. I am confident that the United Nations will\nwork closely with the African Union and that this\npremier Organization of the peoples of the world will\nuse its vast and invaluable experience to ensure that the\nAfrican Union delivers on the important and pressing\nduty of achieving sustainable development in each and\nevery country on our continent.\nTogether, the agencies of the United Nations and\nthe organs of the African Union must give priority to\nsuch matters as human resources development and\ncapacity-building, modernizing Africa's economy,\ndealing decisively with the intolerable debt burden,\nensuring access of our products to the markets of the\ndeveloped world, spreading the emancipation and\nempowerment of women, combating communicable\nand other diseases \u2014 including AIDS, malaria and\ntuberculosis \u2014 and fighting against environmental\ndegradation.\nAt the end of August and the beginning of this\nmonth, the people of South Africa and Africa were\nhonoured to host the World Summit for Sustainable\nDevelopment. A number of far-reaching decisions were\ntaken at that important Summit to ensure that we will\nbequeath to the next generations a better, humane and\nequitable world based on what we agree are the\n11\n\ninseparable pillars of sustainable development:\neconomic development, social development and\nenvironmental protection. Delegates from around the\nworld enshrined the decisions they took in the\nJohannesburg Plan of Implementation and the\nJohannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development\nto ensure that the billions of people who have placed\ntheir fate on our collective shoulders have a concrete\nprogramme of action to realize the goals contained in\nAgenda 21 and other documents adopted by the world\ncommunity of nations during the last 10 years.\nThe Johannesburg Summit confronted the stark\nreality that billions of people across the world are poor,\nand it boldly confirmed the need for us to collaborate\nfor a shared human prosperity through sustainable\ndevelopment. We agree that this goal can be achieved\nbecause we are inspired by the knowledge that the\nresources needed exist within the global community.\nIndeed, Member States have already committed\nthemselves to make available the means necessary for\nthe implementation of our plans, especially finance,\ntechnology and capacity-building.\nIt is critically important that we implement\neverything we agreed, acting with the necessary sense\nof urgency. Again, this we will do together, under the\nleadership of the United Nations, while we continue to\nstrengthen the multilateral system of global governance\nas the only viable international response to all our\nchallenges. Fundamentally, this is the only credible\nresponse to the challenge of globalization and the need\nto enhance human solidarity to meet our common\nneeds.\nIt has been our privilege to chair the Non-Aligned\nMovement for the past four years. During that time, the\nMovement has ensured constant dialogue between the\ncountries of the North and South, which has advanced\nthe commonality of interest between States, confirming\nthe view that the future of all humanity is interlinked.\nWe are pleased that the views of the Movement have\nhelped to inform the advance towards a better life for\nall, to which we have all committed ourselves by word\nand deed.\nIn February next year, Malaysia will assume the\nresponsibility of guiding our Movement as it responds\nto the changed and changing global environment. I am\ncertain that this will add new strength to the Non-\nAligned Movement in the interests of all humanity,\nespecially the poor of the world. As before, the Non-\nAligned Movement is committed to the peaceful\nresolution of all conflicts, including those pertaining to\nPalestine and Israel, as well as Iraq, in keeping with the\nresolutions of the United Nations. These are urgent\ntasks to which the Organization must respond.\nIn conclusion, let me recall that two years ago in\nthe Millennium Declaration more than 150 heads of\nState or Government resolved that \u201cwe believe that the\ncentral challenge we face today is to ensure that\nglobalization becomes a positive force for all the\nworld's people\u201d (resolution 55/2, para. 5). Through\nboth our global and our regional programmes we can\nand must ensure that globalization indeed becomes a\nvaluable process which will bring about sustainable\ndevelopment and prosperity for all.\nFrom this fifty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly must surely issue the unequivocal message\nthat the peoples of the world are united in their resolve\nto sustain the message of hope by advancing the goals\nof peace, of democracy, of prosperity and of\nsustainable development.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffWe meet one year and one day\nafter a terrorist attack brought grief to my country and\nbrought grief to many citizens of our world. Yesterday,\nwe remembered the innocent lives taken that terrible\nmorning. Today we turn to the urgent duty of\nprotecting other lives without illusion and without fear.\nWe have accomplished much in the last year \u2014 in\nAfghanistan and beyond. We have much yet to do \u2014 in\nAfghanistan and beyond. Many nations represented\nhere have joined in the fight against global terror, and\nthe people of the United States are grateful.\nThe United Nations was born in the hope that\nsurvived a world war \u2014 the hope of a world moving\ntowards justice, escaping old patterns of conflict and\nfear. The founding Members resolved that the peace of\nthe world must never again be destroyed by the will\nand the wickedness of any man. We created the United\nNations Security Council so that, unlike the League of\nNations, our deliberations would be more than talk, our\nresolutions would be more than wishes. After\ngenerations of deceitful dictators, broken treaties and\nsquandered lives, we dedicated ourselves to standards\nof human dignity, shared by all, and to a system of\nsecurity defended by all.\nToday, these standards, and this security, are\nchallenged.\nOur commitment to human dignity is challenged\nby persistent poverty and raging disease. The suffering\nis great, and our responsibilities are clear. The United\nStates is joining with the world to supply aid where it\nreaches people and lifts up lives, to extend trade and\nthe prosperity it brings, and to bring medical care\nwhere it is desperately needed.\nAs a symbol of our commitment to human\ndignity, the United States will return to the United\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization (UNESCO). This organization has been\nreformed, and America will participate fully in its\nmission to advance human rights, tolerance and\nlearning.\nOur common security is challenged by regional\nconflicts \u2014 ethnic and religious strife that is ancient,\nbut not inevitable. In the Middle East, there can be no\npeace for either side without freedom for both sides.\nAmerica stands committed to an independent and\ndemocratic Palestine, living side by side with Israel in\npeace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians\ndeserve a government that serves their interests and\nlistens to their voices. My nation will continue to\nencourage all parties to step up to their responsibilities\nas we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the\nconflict.\nAbove all, our principles and our security are\nchallenged today by outlaw groups and regimes that\naccept no law of morality and have no limit to their\nviolent ambitions. In the attacks on America a year\nago, we saw the destructive intentions of our enemies.\nThis threat hides within many nations, including my\nown. In cells and camps, terrorists are plotting further\ndestruction and are building new bases for their war\nagainst civilization. And our greatest fear is that\nterrorists will find a shortcut to their mad ambitions\nwhen an outlaw regime supplies them with the\ntechnologies enabling them to kill on a massive scale.\nIn one place, in one regime, we find all these\ndangers, in their most lethal and aggressive forms \u2014\nexactly the kind of aggressive threat the United Nations\nwas born to confront. Twelve years ago, Iraq invaded\nKuwait without provocation. And the regime's forces\nwere poised to continue their march to seize other\ncountries and their resources. Had Saddam Hussein\nbeen appeased instead of stopped, he would have\nendangered the peace and stability of the world. Yet,\nthis aggression was stopped by the might of coalition\nforces and the will of the United Nations.\nIn order to suspend hostilities and to spare\nhimself, Iraq's dictator accepted a series of\ncommitments. The terms were clear to him, and to all.\nAnd he agreed to prove that he is complying with every\none of those obligations. He has proven instead only\nhis contempt for the United Nations and for all his\npledges. By breaking every pledge, by his deceptions\nand by his cruelties, Saddam Hussein has made the\ncase against himself.\nIn 1991, Security Council resolution 688 (1991)\ndemanded that the Iraqi regime cease at once the\nrepression of its own people, including the systematic\nrepression of minorities, which the Council said,\n\u201cthreaten[ed] international peace and security in the\nregion\u201d.\nThis demand goes ignored. Last year, the United\nNations Commission on Human Rights found that Iraq\ncontinues to commit extremely grave violations of\nhuman rights and that the regime's repression is all\npervasive. Tens of thousands of political opponents and\n7\n\nordinary citizens have been subjected to arbitrary arrest\nand imprisonment, summary execution, and torture by\nbeating, burning, electric shock, starvation, mutilation\nand rape. Wives are tortured in front of their husbands;\nchildren in the presence of their parents; and all of\nthese horrors are concealed from the world by the\napparatus of a totalitarian State.\nIn 1991, the United Nations Security Council,\nthrough its resolutions 686 (1991) and 687 (1991),\ndemanded that Iraq return all prisoners from Kuwait\nand other lands. Iraq's regime agreed. It broke this\npromise. Last year the Secretary-General's high-level\ncoordinator for this issue reported that Kuwaiti, Saudi,\nIndian, Syrian, Lebanese, Iranian, Egyptian, Bahraini,\nand Omani nationals remain unaccounted for \u2014 more\nthan 600 people. One American pilot is among them.\nIn 1991, the United Nations Security Council,\nthrough resolution 687 (1991), demanded that Iraq\nrenounce all involvement with terrorism and permit no\nterrorist organizations to operate in Iraq. Iraq's regime\nagreed. It broke this promise. In violation of Security\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001), Iraq continues to\nshelter and support terrorist organizations that direct\nviolence against Iran, Israel, and Western\nGovernments. Iraqi dissidents abroad are targeted for\nmurder. In 1993, Iraq attempted to assassinate the Emir\nof Kuwait and a former American President. Iraq's\nGovernment openly praised the attacks of 11\nSeptember. Al-Qaida terrorists have escaped from\nAfghanistan and are known to be in Iraq.\nIn 1991, the Iraqi regime agreed to destroy and to\nstop developing all weapons of mass destruction and\nlong-range missiles, and to prove to the world it has\ndone so by complying with rigorous inspections. Iraq\nhas broken every aspect of this fundamental pledge.\nFrom 1991 to 1995, the Iraqi regime said it had\nno biological weapons. After a senior official in its\nweapons program defected and exposed this lie, the\nregime admitted to producing tens of thousands of\nlitres of anthrax and other deadly biological agents for\nuse in Scud missile warheads, aerial bombs and aircraft\nspray tanks. United Nations inspectors believe Iraq has\nproduced two to four times the amount of biological\nagents it declared and has failed to account for more\nthan three metric tons of material that could be used to\nproduce biological weapons. Right now, Iraq is\nexpanding and improving facilities that were used for\nthe production of biological weapons.\nUnited Nations inspections also reveal that Iraq\nlikely maintains stockpiles of VX, mustard and other\nchemical agents, and that the regime is rebuilding and\nexpanding facilities capable of producing chemical\nweapons.\nAnd in 1995, after four years of deception, Iraq\nfinally admitted that it had had a crash nuclear\nweapons programme prior to the Gulf war. We know\nnow that, were it not for that war, the regime in Iraq\nwould likely have possessed a nuclear weapon no later\nthan 1993.\nToday, Iraq continues to withhold important\ninformation about its nuclear programme: weapons\ndesign, procurement logs, experiment data, an\naccounting of nuclear materials and documentation of\nforeign assistance. Iraq employs capable nuclear\nscientists and technicians. It retains physical\ninfrastructure needed to build a nuclear weapon. Iraq\nhas made several attempts to buy high-strength\naluminium tubes used to enrich uranium for a nuclear\nweapon. Should Iraq acquire fissile material, it would\nbe able to build a nuclear weapon within a year. And\nIraq's State-controlled media have reported numerous\nmeetings between Saddam Hussein and his nuclear\nscientists, leaving little doubt about his continued\nappetite for these weapons.\nIraq also possesses a force of Scud-type missiles\nwith ranges beyond the 150 kilometres permitted by the\nUnited Nations. Work at testing and production\nfacilities shows that Iraq is building more long-range\nmissiles that can inflict mass death throughout the\nregion.\nIn 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the\nworld imposed economic sanctions on Iraq. Those\nsanctions were maintained after the war to compel the\nregime's compliance with Security Council resolutions.\nIn time, Iraq was allowed to use oil revenues to buy\nfood. Saddam Hussein has subverted that programme,\nworking around the sanctions to buy missile\ntechnology and military materials. He blames the\nsuffering of Iraq's people on the United Nations, even\nas he uses his oil wealth to build lavish palaces for\nhimself and to buy arms for his country. By refusing to\ncomply with his own agreements, he bears full guilt for\nthe hunger and misery of innocent Iraqi citizens.\nIn 1991, Iraq promised United Nations inspectors\nimmediate and unrestricted access to verify Iraq's\ncommitment to rid itself of weapons of mass\n8\n\ndestruction and long-range missiles. Iraq broke that\npromise, spending seven years deceiving, evading and\nharassing United Nations inspectors before ceasing\ncooperation entirely. Just months after the 1991\nceasefire, the Security Council twice renewed its\ndemand that the Iraqi regime cooperate fully with\ninspectors, condemning Iraq's serious violations of its\nobligations. The Security Council again renewed that\ndemand in 1994 and twice more in 1996, deploring\nIraq's clear violations of its obligations. The Security\nCouncil renewed its demand three more times in 1997,\nciting flagrant violations, and three more times in\n1998, calling Iraq's behaviour totally unacceptable.\nAnd in 1999, the demand was renewed yet again.\nAs we meet today, it has been almost four years\nsince the last United Nations inspector set foot in\nIraq \u2014 four years for the Iraqi regime to plan and to\nbuild and to test behind the cloak of secrecy. We know\nthat Saddam Hussein pursued weapons of mass murder\neven when inspectors were in his country. Are we to\nassume that he stopped when they left? The history, the\nlogic and the facts lead to one conclusion. Saddam\nHussein's regime is a grave and gathering danger. To\nsuggest otherwise is to hope against the evidence. To\nassume this regime's good faith is to bet the lives of\nmillions and the peace of the world in a reckless\ngamble. And that is a risk we must not take.\nWe have been more than patient. We have tried\nsanctions. We have tried the carrot of oil-for-food and\nthe stick of coalition military strikes. But Saddam\nHussein has defied all those efforts and continues to\ndevelop weapons of mass destruction. The first time we\nmay be completely certain he has nuclear weapons is\nwhen, God forbid, he uses one. We owe it to all our\ncitizens to do everything in our power to prevent that\nday from coming.\nThe conduct of the Iraqi regime is a threat to the\nauthority of the United Nations and a threat to peace.\nIraq has answered a decade of United Nations demands\nwith a decade of defiance. All the world now faces a\ntest and the United Nations a difficult and defining\nmoment. Are Security Council resolutions to be\nhonoured and enforced or cast aside without\nconsequence? Will the United Nations serve the\npurpose of its founding, or will it be irrelevant?\nThe United States helped found the United\nNations. We want the United Nations to be effective\nand respected and successful. We want the resolutions\nof the world's most important multilateral body to be\nenforced, and right now those resolutions are being\nunilaterally subverted by the Iraqi regime. Our\npartnership of nations can meet the test before us by\nmaking clear what we now expect of the Iraqi regime.\nIf the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will\nimmediately and unconditionally forswear, disclose\nand remove or destroy all weapons of mass destruction,\nlong-range missiles and all related material.\nIf the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will\nimmediately end all support for terrorism and act to\nsuppress it, as all States are required to do by Security\nCouncil resolutions.\nIf the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will cease\npersecution of its civilian population, including Shia,\nSunnis, Kurds, Turkomans and others \u2014 again, as\nrequired by Security Council resolutions.\nIf the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will release or\naccount for all Gulf war personnel whose fate is still\nunknown. It will return the remains of any who are\ndeceased, return stolen property, accept liability for\nlosses resulting from the invasion of Kuwait and fully\ncooperate with international efforts to resolve those\nissues, as required by Security Council resolutions.\nIf the Iraqi regime wishes peace, it will\nimmediately end all illicit trade outside the oil-for-food\nprogramme. It will accept United Nations\nadministration of funds from that programme, to ensure\nthat the money is used fairly and promptly for the\nbenefit of the Iraqi people.\nIf all those steps are taken, it will signal a new\nopenness and accountability in Iraq. And it could open\nthe prospect of the United Nations helping to build a\nGovernment that represents all Iraqis \u2014 a Government\nbased on respect for human rights, economic liberty\nand internationally supervised elections.\nThe United States has no quarrel with the Iraqi\npeople. They have suffered too long in silent captivity.\nLiberty for the Iraqi people is a great moral cause and a\ngreat strategic goal. The people of Iraq deserve it. The\nsecurity of all nations requires it.\nFree societies do not intimidate through cruelty\nand conquest, and open societies do not threaten the\nworld with mass murder. The United States supports\npolitical and economic liberty in a unified Iraq.\n9\n\nWe can harbour no illusions, and that is important\ntoday to remember. Saddam Hussein attacked Iran in\n1980 and Kuwait in 1990. He has fired ballistic\nmissiles at Iran and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Israel.\nHis regime once ordered the killing of every person\nbetween the ages of 15 and 70 in certain Kurdish\nvillages in northern Iraq. He has gassed many Iranians\nand 40 Iraqi villages.\nMy nation will work with the Security Council to\nmeet our common challenge. If Iraq's regime defies us\nagain, the world must move deliberately and decisively\nto hold Iraq to account. We will work with the Security\nCouncil for the necessary resolutions. But the purposes\nof the United States should not be doubted. The\nSecurity Council resolutions will be enforced, and the\njust demands of peace and security will be met, or\naction will be unavoidable, and a regime that has lost\nits legitimacy will also lose its power.\nEvents can turn in one of two ways.\nIf we fail to act in the face of danger, the people\nof Iraq will continue to live in brutal submission. The\nregime will have new power to bully, dominate and\nconquer its neighbours, condemning the Middle East to\nmore years of bloodshed and fear. The region will\nremain unstable, with little hope of freedom, and\nisolated from the progress of our times. With every step\nthe Iraqi regime takes towards gaining and deploying\nthe most terrible weapons, our own options to confront\nthat regime will narrow. And if an emboldened regime\nwere to supply these weapons to terrorist allies, then\nthe attacks of 11 September would be a prelude to far\ngreater horrors.\nIf we meet our responsibilities, if we overcome\nthis danger, we can arrive at a very different future.\nThe people of Iraq can shake off their captivity. They\ncan one day join a democratic Afghanistan and a\ndemocratic Palestine, inspiring reforms throughout the\nMuslim world. These nations can show by their\nexample that honest government, respect for women,\nand the great Islamic tradition of learning can triumph\nin the Middle East and beyond. We will show that the\npromise of the United Nations can be fulfilled in our\ntime.\nNeither of these outcomes is certain. Both have\nbeen set before us. We must choose between a world of\nfear and a world of progress. We cannot stand by and\ndo nothing while dangers gather. We must stand up for\nour security and for the permanent rights and hopes of\nmankind. By heritage and by choice, the United States\nof America will make that stand. Representatives to the\nUnited Nations have the power to make that stand as\nwell.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffPlease allow\nme to preface my indication by indicating to this\nAssembly the regret of my Head of Government and of\nmy Foreign Minister, who could not join us on this\noccasion due to pressing domestic electoral\ncommitments.\nI would wish, on behalf of the Government and\npeople of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, to\nextend to Mr. Kavan our most sincere congratulations\non his election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-seventh session. We are convinced\nthat, under his enlightened guidance, we will address\nwith determination and courage the issues that confront\nthe international community.\nWe would also wish to express at this time our\ndeep appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-\nsoo, President of the Assembly at its fifty-sixth session,\nfor the courageous leadership which he displayed in\nbringing that session to a successful conclusion under\ndifficult and trying circumstances.\nTo the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, we\nwish to place on record our appreciation for his\nrelentless commitment to the cause of peace, security\nand development and for his tireless efforts in\nachieving the goals of this world body.\nThe delegation of Trinidad and Tobago extends a\nwarm welcome to Switzerland on its becoming the\n190th State Member of the United Nations and looks\nforward in the not-too-distant future to the admission\nof Timor-Leste into our United Nations family.\nThe maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity, together with the promotion of economic\nprogress and the achievement of social justice for\npeoples all over the globe, are the pillars on which this\nOrganization was founded more than half a century\nago. These goals remain as valid today, and even more\nso, as when our founding fathers created this\nOrganization.\nAs Governments, therefore, and as Member\nStates of the United Nations, it is incumbent upon us,\nthe international community as a whole, to reaffirm\nconstantly, by word and deed, our faith in and\ncommitment to the fundamental purposes and\nprinciples of the United Nations, particularly in the\narea of international peace and security. In this field,\nthe Security Council, charged as it is with primary\nresponsibility under the Charter for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, must be allowed to\nfully play its fundamental role, as it did in confronting\nthe challenge posed to the international community by\nthe terrorist acts committed in this very city on 11\nSeptember 2001.\nTrinidad and Tobago remains committed to\nworking with the Counter-Terrorism Committee\nestablished by Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)\nin order to do our part to eradicate the scourge of\nterrorism from our world.\nOn 31 August 1962, some 40 years ago, Trinidad\nand Tobago became an independent State and\nimmediately thereafter joined this universal body. We\nin Trinidad and Tobago recognize and appreciate the\nrole that the United Nations has played in promoting\nfundamental human rights and freedoms, the\ninternational rule of law, the peaceful settlement of\ndisputes, the right to self-determination and the\nsovereign equality of States. Without proper\nobservance by all States, large and small, of these basic\nprinciples, the world would most certainly have been a\nmore challenging place for us all.\nIt is in that context that Trinidad and Tobago\nviews with increasing concern the continued absence of\na just and lasting peace in the Middle East. It is clear\nthat peace will continue to elude that region unless all\nparties concerned demonstrate unequivocally the will\nto collaborate with a view to achieving the vision set\nout in Security Council resolution 1397 (2002).\nThe maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity is a sine qua non for the achievement of our\neconomic and social development goals. It is against\nthis background that Trinidad and Tobago, as a small\nState and as a developing country, supports all efforts\nmade through the international conferences and special\nsessions held within the framework of the United\nNations to address the international social agenda in\npursuit of integral human development worldwide.\nSome of those include the special session on HIV/\nAIDS, the International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, the Second World Assembly on Ageing,\nthe special session on children and the just concluded\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development, all of\nwhich have not only recognized the concerns of the\nmore vulnerable groups within our societies, but have\n30\n\nalso identified various policy alternatives through\nwhich those concerns can be addressed.\nThere can, in fact, be no meaningful development\nif significant segments of our populations are allowed\nto remain in a state of increasing vulnerability. As a\nresult, Trinidad and Tobago participated fully in the\nwork of the Second World Assembly on Ageing, the\nspecial session on children and the special session on\nHIV/AIDS.\nIt is our hope that the adoption of the Political\nDeclaration and the Madrid International Plan of\nAction on Ageing, as well as the Declaration and Plan\nof Action emerging from this year's special session on\nchildren, will serve as the basis for the development of\npolicies at the national level to deal with the problems\nfaced by these two vulnerable groups in our societies.\nFor its part, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago\nhas recently completed a draft national policy on\nageing that will address the principal concerns of our\nageing population.\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to hamper the\neconomic and social development of our Caribbean\nregion, affecting as it does the most economically\nactive and productive segments of our societies. My\nGovernment has sought to incorporate this issue as a\nmatter of priority into its national strategic planning\nprocess. It is virtually impossible, however, for any one\ncountry unilaterally to deal effectively with this public\nhealth issue. For that reason, Trinidad and Tobago is\ncommitted to participating fully in all relevant regional\nand international initiatives.\nIn that regard, member States of the Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM) were among the first to\ntranslate the global commitments undertaken at the\nspecial session on HIV/AIDS into regional targets\nwhen, in 2001, our Governments adopted the Nassau\nDeclaration on Health, which identified priorities for\naction and partnership in addressing this global health\nissue. However, assistance is urgently needed to boost\nthese national and regional initiatives. We consider\ntimely the launching of the Global Fund to Fight HIV/\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. We hope that through\nthis Fund, Governments will be further empowered in\ntheir efforts to implement measures aimed at the\neventual eradication of these diseases.\nAs a country which falls within the category of\nsmall island developing States, Trinidad and Tobago\nfeels obliged to make reference to the tendency in the\ninternational community to underestimate the\nphenomenon of vulnerability, both as a condition of\nsize and stage of development. Small island developing\neconomies are by definition vulnerable, and in a global\nvillage, where negative occurrences in one sphere can\nhave a ripple effect in others, the implications for us all\nare as real as they are apparent. The lack of inherent\ncapacity, technology and technical know-how limits the\nadaptive capacity of small island developing States to\ncope with the challenges that they face, including\nglobal environmental problems such as climate change,\nbiodiversity and land degradation.\nAs we engage in efforts at the international level\nto achieve environmentally sound economic\ndevelopment, Trinidad and Tobago remains cautious in\nthe light of the dismal record regarding the\nimplementation of commitments made at the Rio\nSummit, 10 years ago. That Summit concluded with the\nsigning of two conventions, one on climate change and\nthe other on biodiversity, together with the adoption of\nAgenda 21.\nIt continues to concern us that emissions of\ngreenhouse gases have increased worldwide and that\nclimate change is occurring at a faster rate than\npreviously estimated, especially since small island\ndeveloping States are disproportionately vulnerable to\nthe impact of climate change, while being responsible\nfor a minuscule proportion of such emissions. Trinidad\nand Tobago therefore urges that decisive action be\ntaken to ensure that the Kyoto Protocol comes into\nforce as early as possible, as that is the only existing\ninternational instrument that addresses these problems.\nWe therefore welcome the political commitment given\nby the leaders of some key industrialized countries to\nratify this Protocol in the near future.\nIt would seem, however, that progress under\nAgenda 21 has been limited primarily by lack of\nfunding and capacity, which has resulted in the\nwidening of the gap between the attainment of\nsustainable development and the alleviation of poverty.\nTrinidad and Tobago is therefore pleased that the\nrecently concluded World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment, held in Johannesburg, South Africa,\nagreed to specific targets in areas such as water and\nsanitation, health, biodiversity loss, restoration of\ndepleted fish stocks and chemicals.\nThe fact that the Johannesburg Summit achieved\na greater synthesis and integration of the three pillars\n31\n\nof sustainable development, namely, the social,\neconomic and environmental, is also a welcome\ndevelopment. The enormous challenges that these\nissues collectively pose provide a profound insight into\nthe magnitude of the task faced by developing\ncountries in their quest for sustainable development.\nThe real test of whether Johannesburg was a success\nwill, however, come in the months and years ahead as\nwe seek to implement the commitments made by\nMember States.\nWe must build on the momentum of the World\nSummit on Sustainable Development and ensure that\nour future course of action guarantees the outcomes\nenvisaged in the Plan of Implementation and the\nPolitical Declaration emanating from that Summit. It is\nin this respect that Trinidad and Tobago would\ntherefore expect that a priority of this Assembly would\nbe a decision to convene an international conference in\n2004 to review the implementation of the Barbados\nPlan of Action for the Sustainable Development of\nSmall Island Developing States, and more so in view of\nthe growing recognition by the international\ncommunity of the special and vulnerable situation of\nthese countries.\nAdditionally, the Assembly may wish to note that\nsome of these smaller economies continue to be faced\nby circumstances such as onerous debt-servicing\nschedules, lack of access to new finance and obstacles\nin penetrating non-traditional markets, which negate all\ntheir efforts aimed at economic advancement.\nIt is for this reason that Trinidad and Tobago\nlooks forward to the early implementation of the\nenhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt\nInitiative and other United Nations initiatives aimed at\nalleviating the economic burdens faced by many low-\nand middle-income countries. These countries are\nbeing asked to service debts and at the same time to\nfulfil their commitments to the Millennium\ndevelopment agenda. In this regard, we welcome the\nrecent appointment by the Secretary-General of a High\nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries,\nLandlocked Developing Countries and Small Island\nDeveloping States. Trinidad and Tobago looks forward\nto working with the High Representative to ensure the\neffective discharge of his mandate, particularly as it\nrelates to small island developing States.\nAnother noble attempt conceptualized within the\nUnited Nations framework was the International\nConference on Financing for Development, held in\nMonterrey earlier this year. Trinidad and Tobago is\nheartened by the outcome of that Conference that\ndefined the necessary actions for addressing some of\nthe more pressing problems faced by developing\ncountries in the areas of mobilizing domestic and\ninternational resources for development, international\ntrade, financial and technical cooperation for\ndevelopment and external debt. My delegation\ntherefore urges this Assembly to endorse the Monterrey\nConsensus as adopted by that Conference.\nAt the regional level, Trinidad and Tobago is\nengaged in joint efforts with its Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM) partners to assume responsibility for the\nmanagement of our developing economies. At a\nSpecial CARICOM Summit held last month,\nCARICOM leaders mandated that a regional\nstabilization fund should be created within the\nframework of a long-term economic transformation\nprogramme. The purpose of the fund will be to provide\nregional economies with the necessary financial\nresources to respond to current and long-term\neconomic difficulties. This regional financial\ncooperation programme is intended to augment\nbudgetary resources available to member States of the\nCommunity from both domestic sources and\nmultilateral institutions.\nTrinidad and Tobago remains committed to the\ninternational rule of law and to justice for all. Our role\nin the reintroduction into the international agenda of\nthe idea of the creation of a permanent International\nCriminal Court in 1989 is well known. And, since that\ntime, Trinidad and Tobago has not ceased to promote\nsupport for that Court, both regionally and\ninternationally. It continues to be the hope of my\nGovernment that at the Review Conference of 2009,\nthe crimes of drug-trafficking and terrorism will also\nbe included within the jurisdiction of the Court.\nIt is noteworthy that many States regard the\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court as the\nsingle most important international instrument since\nthe adoption of the United Nations Charter. The\nsuccessful conclusion of the first meeting of the\nAssembly of States Parties to the Statute last week was\na positive step towards the operational phase of the\nCourt, which now stands as a permanent warning to\nwould-be perpetrators of the crimes within its\njurisdiction that impunity will no longer be tolerated by\nthe international community and that justice will be\n32\n\nassured to their victims. In the election of judges to\nthat Court, Trinidad and Tobago would, as a small\nState, consider it an honour to have one of its nationals\nelected in order to continue its contribution to the cause\nof international criminal justice.\nBut justice for all victims of the most heinous\ncrimes of genocide, war crimes and crimes against\nhumanity will only be assured when this most recently\ncreated International Criminal Tribunal gains the\nwidest possible acceptance. We therefore encourage\nthose States that have not yet done so to ratify or\naccede to the Statute.\nIn order to ensure that the Court will truly\nachieve the goals for which it was established, the\nStates Parties must stand together in their efforts to\npreserve the integrity of the Statute to which they have\ncommitted themselves and must, with one accord,\nresist any attempts to undermine the effectiveness and\nindependence of the Court.\nIn conclusion, the issues which I have raised in\nthis forum today point to the need for the globalization\nof genuine commitment to the resolution of the\nproblems that currently confront our international\ncommunity. What is required therefore is a greater\nsense of shared commitment to the fundamental\npurposes and principles of the United Nations in the\nface of new and ominous threats to global peace and\nsecurity; to the vision of a world free from poverty,\nhunger and disease; and to an international\norganization fully charged by its Member States with\nthe political will to tackle frontally all the challenges\nthat pose threats to the very survival of mankind.\nTrinidad and Tobago, forty years after joining the\nUnited Nations, renews before the Assembly its firm\ncommitment to abide fully by the purposes and\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and to make\nits contribution to the economic and social progress of\npeoples the world over."

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me begin by stating that\nour thoughts and prayers are with the people of the\nUnited States as they commemorate the first\nanniversary of the 11 September 2001 terror attacks in\nNew York and Washington. The events of that day\ncompel us to unite and adopt effective measures to\neradicate the scourge of terrorism.\nI take this opportunity to reaffirm Botswana's\nstrong support for the work of the Security Council\nCounter-Terrorism Committee established to monitor\nthe effective implementation of Security Council\nresolution 1373 (2001). The international community\nmust maintain its unity and remain vigilant so as to\nensure that such acts of terror never happen again.\nIt is my pleasure to extend to you, Sir, and to\nyour country, Chad, the warm congratulations of\nBotswana on your election to a vice-presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-seventh session, and to\nwish you every success. I assure you of the full\ncooperation of my delegation.\nIf we had started this meeting on time, I would\nnot have minded at all. I have greater respect for time\nthan for hordes of latecomers. I am also grateful for the\nfact that after other heads of State or Government left\nNew York, nobody removed the chairs in the Assembly\nHall.\nI wish to pay tribute to Mr. Han Seung-Soo of the\nRepublic of Korea, President of the General Assembly\nat the fifty-seventh session, for the skilful manner in\nwhich he conducted the work of that session.\nLet me also place on record that we appreciate\nthe good work which our Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, is doing to reform the United Nations funds and\nprogrammes. The reform process is contributing to the\nstrengthening of the capacity of those special\ninstitutions to deliver assistance to Member States in a\nmore coherent and efficient manner.\nI join others in congratulating and welcoming\ninto the United Nations family Switzerland, a new\nMember State, and East Timor, which is soon to\nbecome one.\n2\n\nI am delighted that Switzerland has now taken its\nrightful place in this world body. The United Nations\nhas indeed been strengthened, and its universal\ncharacter has undoubtedly been enhanced.\nIn East Timor the United Nations demonstrated\nits commitment to the principles and purposes of the\nCharter by playing a pivotal and decisive role in\nensuring that the people of East Timor can, at long\nlast, exercise their right to national self-determination.\nWe live in a world of diverse cultures and\ntraditions, yet we are united by our common humanity.\nThere is no alternative to coming together to address\nthe many dangers that threaten humanity. No one\ncountry can hope to successfully confront, on its own,\nthose global challenges  whether underdevelopment,\npoverty, insecurity or threats to peace. They are\nchallenges that require global solutions and the\nparticipation of all global stakeholders to confront\nthem. It is for those reasons that the United Nations\nremains an important unifying institution for all of\nhumanity. It is the only institution that can play the\nimportant role of fostering partnership, cooperation and\nmultilateralism.\nStates  especially those, like ours, that our\nsmall  have high expectations of what multilateral\ncooperation can do for them, and how it can change for\nthe better the lives and destiny of the peoples of the\nUnited Nations.\nIn this regard, we cannot fail to speak about the\nvaried and complex challenges developing countries\ncontinue to face, particularly in the continent of Africa.\nDespite consistent efforts in the past to assist Africa,\nthere are still widening disparities in development\nbetween the continent and the rest of the world. Africa\ncontinues to experience high levels of poverty, which is\naggravated by, among other things, the unfavourable\nglobal economic environment and conflicts. These\nchallenges are further compounded by the HIV/AIDS\npandemic.\nLet me hasten to state that to acknowledge the\nexistence of problems does not mean that the future is\nentirely bleak. There are positive developments that\ngive reason for hope for the realization of the\naspirations of our people. Africa has committed itself\nto creating an environment conducive to economic\ngrowth and development. We have taken concrete steps\nto ensure that Africa is united and better prepared to\nface up to its problems.\nWe have taken the first step in a broad and\ncomprehensive process to bring our countries together\nthrough the establishment of the African Union. The\nNew Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD),\nwhich was considered by this Assembly this week, is\none of the major initiatives of the African Union.\nBotswana is convinced that NEPAD provides a sound\nbasis for building real partnerships within the\ncontinent, as well as with the rest of the international\ncommunity.\nIt is important to reiterate Africa's deep\nappreciation of the support and assistance that we have\nreceived and continue to receive from the international\ncommunity. We particularly welcome the resolution\nthat has just been adopted by the General Assembly\nmandating the United Nations funds and programmes\nto support the implementation of NEPAD. Botswana is\nalso happy with the decision of the G8 countries to join\nhands with us to ensure the success of this initiative.\nWe stand ready to make our contribution so that the\nnoble objectives of NEPAD can be attained.\nCentral to the achievement of Africa's\ndevelopment objectives is a commitment by the\ninternational community to implement the decisions of\nthe United Nations world conferences. We need to\nwork assiduously to implement the Monterrey\nConsensus, which identifies sources that can be used to\nfinance the development goals that we have set for\nourselves. Potential sources include the mobilization of\ndomestic resources; the mobilization of external\nresources, including foreign direct investment;\nincreased financial and technical cooperation; and the\nresolution of the debt crisis. The Monterrey Consensus\nalso recognizes trade as an engine of growth and\ndevelopment. The international community therefore\nhas a responsibility to ensure that developing countries\ncan participate in world trade. In this regard, we view\npartnership agreements, such as the Cotonou\nAgreement and the African Growth and Opportunity\nAct, as important steps towards fulfilling some of the\nobjectives of the Monterrey Consensus.\nHIV/AIDS remains, undoubtedly, the most\nserious threat to the economic and social progress of\nthe world. Its devastating impact on the African\ncontinent is well documented. There is no doubt that no\none country has the capacity to deal with the problems\nassociated with this epidemic on its own. If we are to\nconquer it, we will need a strategy that combines\nefforts on a broad front. Those who think that they are\n3\n\nstill free from the epidemic and that it is an African\nproblem had better wake up, because next time it will\nbe on their own doorstep.\nBotswana is immensely grateful for the support it\nhas received from the United Nations and other\ncooperating partners in its efforts to fight the epidemic.\nI also wish to commend the Secretary-General for his\ntireless efforts in mobilizing the international\ncommunity to support our efforts. I am sure that, with\nthe help of the international community, we in Africa\nwill still be standing when the dust settles.\nBotswana is pleased to note the commendable\nefforts that the United Nations continues to make in the\nmaintenance of peace and security in various parts of\nthe world. With the continued assistance of the United\nNations and the rest of the international community, we\nhave reason to be optimistic and hope that the\ncontinent of Africa will soon find peace.\nWe have closely followed the Organization's\ninitiative in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\nparticularly in the areas of the disarmament,\ndemobilization, repatriation, resettlement and\nreintegration of the former combatants into civil\nsociety. We welcome the ongoing consultations\nbetween the various parties to the conflict. We are\nanxious, however, to see full-fledged negotiations that\ncan lead to a lasting political settlement. The people of\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo yearn for peace\nand national reconciliation, as well as the social and\neconomic development of their country.\nWe therefore call upon all parties to demonstrate\ngreater determination and a sense of urgency in the\nsearch for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in that\ncountry. Peace in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo is possible and necessary, but in the final\nanalysis, it depends on the political will of the\nsignatories to the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement.\nI wish to salute the efforts and indomitable spirit\nof my immediate predecessor, Sir Ketumile Masire. He\nhas been tireless and unwavering in his mission of\nfacilitating the inter-Congolese dialogue, convincing\nthe people of that country that peace can come only if\nthey are willing to talk to each other. Nobody will\ncome from heaven or hell to create peace for them. I\nalso wish to place on record Botswana's appreciation\nof the efforts and determination of President Mbeki of\nSouth Africa. He has invested substantial time, energy\nand resources to find solutions to the conflict in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\nBotswana welcomes and commends the historic\nstep taken by the Government of Angola and UNITA in\nsigning the Memorandum of Understanding of 4 April\n2002 as an addendum to the Lusaka Protocol. The\npeople of Angola have opted for peace. They expect\nthe international community to help them consolidate\nthis peace. Let us not fail them. I ask the ambassadors\nand foreign ministers who happen to be present here to\ntake the message to my fellow heads of State in Africa\nthat we should not let down the people of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and, above all, the\npeople of Angola. They have suffered enough.\nConflicts and instability in other parts of the\nworld, such as the Middle East and Afghanistan, are of\nserious concern to us. We look to the international\ncommunity, within the framework of the United\nNations, to play a greater role in the peaceful\nresolution of those conflicts.\nLet me conclude by reiterating Botswana's\ncontinued support for the United Nations and express\nmy delegation's appreciation to the Secretary-General,\nwhose visionary leadership has continued to guide our\nOrganization.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We are\nconfident that your experience and wisdom, already\nwell-proven, will ensure the success of this session. I\nwould also like to thank your predecessor, His\nExcellency Mr. Han Seung-soo, for his able guidance\nof the work of the last session. Also, I would like to\ncongratulate the Swiss Confederation and the\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste on their\nadmission to membership in the United Nations.\nI would also like to congratulate most warmly our\nUnited Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, and the\nUnited Nations staff for their excellent work in\npromoting the noble goals of this Organization.\nWe note with satisfaction the significant activities\nand the commendable international conferences held\nthis past year, primarily the United Nations Conference\non HIV/AIDS in New York, the Monterrey Conference\non Financing for Development and the World Summit\non Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.\nSuch international conferences have placed the\nworld before its collective responsibilities in dealing\nwith core issues that require global solutions. What is\nat stake is the equilibrium and future of the world. This\nsession is being held one year after the criminal attacks\nagainst New York and Washington. I would like to\nconfirm once again that Mauritania totally condemns\nthose terrorist acts. We condemn terrorism in all its\nforms. Mauritania will be actively involved in regional\nand international initiatives to combat that pernicious\nphenomenon. We reconfirm our full support for the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions and are resolved\nto implement them, specifically resolution 1373 (2001)\nof 28 September 2001.\nThe tragic events highlighted a new reality.\nTerrorism, instead of being a marginal phenomenon,\nhas become a core issue ignoring borders and which\ncan only be combated through a global strategy.\nNobody should believe that fighting terrorism is a clash\nbetween two civilizations or cultures. Rather, we must\nact together to show that the elimination of terrorism is\na new step taken by the human race towards further\ndeveloping its comprehensive, all-inclusive civilization\nand attaining its aspirations for a safe and better future.\nIn order to achieve peace and security, the United\nNations must play an ever-larger part to strengthen\ninternational law. We noted the sustained efforts and\nthe repeated calls for peace in the Middle East. We\nbelieve the Arab countries' initiative adopted at the\nBeirut Summit offers the ideal framework for\ncomprehensive and lasting peace that will ensure\nprogress and prosperity for all peoples in the region.\nWe noted with great interest the vision of the President\nof the United States of America, Mr. George Bush, who\nspoke of the need for the coexistence of two\nindependent States, Palestine and Israel, and efforts by\nthe Quartet and the European Union with a view to the\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State with\nAl-Quds al-Sharif as its capital. This play is pursuant\nto the terms of reference of Madrid and the land-for-\npeace principle and is also in accordance with Security\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 425\n(1978. We reiterate the need for an immediate Israeli\nwithdrawal from all territories of the Palestinian\nAuthority, an end to the suffering of the Palestinian\npeople and the immediate resumption of peace\nnegotiations. This is the only way to have peace and\nsecurity in the Middle East.\nWe hope to see a return to peace, stability and\nharmony in the Gulf region. We oppose the use of force\nagainst Iraq and affirm our support for a peaceful\n25\n\nsolution to settle the crisis in accordance with\ninternational law.\nWe are concerned that there should be respect for\nthe independence and territorial integrity of Kuwait,\nand respect for the independence and territorial\nintegrity of Iraq. Once again we call for the lifting of\nthe embargo against the Iraqi people, which has now\nbeen in place for more than 12 years.\nWith regard to Western Sahara, we support the\nefforts by the Secretary-General and his Personal\nEnvoy, James Baker, to find a definitive solution to\ninsure stability in the region, one that would be\naccepted by all of the parties.\nOn developments pursuant to the Lockerbie\ncrisis, we welcome the significant steps taken by the\nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya to find a diplomatic solution\nto the problem. We think it is now up to the Security\nCouncil to take the necessary steps to lift the embargo\nimposed on Libya.\nTurning to our own continent, Africa, we\nwelcome the birth of the African Union, which will be\na framework for enabling the African peoples to\nachieve their aspirations for progress and development.\nWe also support the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment (NEPAD), which seeks to strengthen\nregional cooperation to achieve economic integration,\nand we welcome the support given to this initiative by\nour development partners.\nMauritania reiterates its support for the People's\nRepublic of China, the sole legitimate representative of\nthe Chinese people, pursuant to General Assembly\nresolution 2758 (XXVI) of 1971. Mauritania welcomes\nthe efforts made by the Government of the People's\nRepublic of China for the peaceful reunification of that\ncountry.\nWe have now seen it proven that violence and\nextremism result from poverty and despair. The\ninternational community must therefore make more\nefforts in the areas of human solidarity and social\nprogress everywhere in the world. We call for the\nnecessary assistance to be provided to the countries of\nthe South and for the opening of the markets of the\ndeveloped countries to the products of developing\ncountries.  Investment opportunities in developing\ncountries should be increased.\nDespite the huge challenges and a difficult\neconomic international situation, the Islamic Republic\nof Mauritania has taken major steps towards\ndevelopment and construction, as noted by our\nPresident at the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment in Johannesburg. We have established\nsolid foundations for sustainable development and have\ndeveloped a clear-cut strategy to combat poverty.\nWe have taken steps towards comprehensive\neducation, health care and other social services for our\npeople such as drinking water, electricity and\ncommunications. Illiteracy and ignorance are major\nobstacles to development. We have launched broad\nliteracy and education campaigns for our citizens. We\nhave been able to do this because of our pluralist\ndemocratic system, which insures freedoms and human\nrights in an atmosphere of security and stability.\nThe United Nations Charter seeks common goals\nof freedom and solidarity for all people. New\ndevelopments in the international arena in the last few\nyears require our Organization, including the Security\nCouncil, to adapt to changes. Today, more than ever\nbefore, we must comply with the commitments we\nmade to achieve a new world order based on justice\nand rights law, to ensure peace, security and dignity for\nall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe\nworld has changed since the Assembly last met. The\ntwenty-first century began on 11 September 2001, and\nour great collective challenge is to ensure the primacy\nof the rule of law in the sphere of international\nrelations. The natural forum for that legal culture and\nlegitimacy is the United Nations.\nIn that context and with that ambition,\nparticipating in the great objectives of peace, the rule\nof law and the preservation of the international\norder  to which the Secretary-General referred\nduring the current session  it is an honour for me to\naddress the Assembly on behalf of Spain, also a\ncandidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security\nCouncil. Should we be elected, we are determined to\ndevote all the effort and resources necessary to fulfil\nthat great responsibility.\nA year ago, the entire world became aware of the\nhorror of terrorism that threatens us all. We asked\nourselves then what course the international\ncommunity should take and what role the United\nNations should play in shaping international relations\nin the twenty-first century. Uncertainty remains, but it\nis now clear that interdependence among countries and\nregions will be the centre of gravity of a newborn\ninternational civil society. States must cooperate with\none another to make use of opportunities and to fight\nagainst threats, because neither opportunities nor\nthreats have a purely local character.\nThus, it is time for the rule of law, and the United\nNations, as the seat of the political and normative\nlegitimacy of international society, is called to be the\ncentre of gravity of this new framework. The United\nNations is the organization that can and should\nimpose  including through the use of force, if it is\nunavoidable  the decisions taken collectively by the\ncommunity of States.\nThe occasions on which the United Nations has\nbeen able to respond to the demands of the\ninternational community have also been successes for\nthe Member States. In the same way, the cases in which\nthe United Nations has been unable to find solutions to\nexisting problems have also been our responsibility. All\nof us make up the United Nations; its failures are our\nfailures, as its successes are our successes.\nTerrorism is a clear example of this and of the\nneed to react together resolutely. Each terrorist attack is\nan attack against us all, and we must all react.\nTerrorists do not respect borders; borders should\ntherefore not constitute an obstacle to the collective\nfight against this scourge. Are there any today who still\nthink that this problem does not, or will not, affect\nthem?\nThe United Nations is aware of the gravity of the\nthreat that this scourge poses to the principles that\nunderpin the Charter and that are the foundation of our\ncivilization. Security Council resolution 1373 (2001)\nhas put international cooperation against terrorism on a\nsubstantially different level. That resolution charts the\ncourse for the cooperation that is essential for the\ninternational community to be able to deal with those\nwho attack our most essential values: life, freedom and\ndemocracy.\nThe growing importance of law has a very direct\nbearing upon the intense activity of the Organization in\nfavour of human rights. In this context, allow me to\nfocus on a heinous and silent violation of human rights:\ndomestic violence. This scourge primarily affects\nwomen, children and older persons  the most\nvulnerable sectors of society in all our cultures,\nregardless of level of development or social well-being.\nHow can we explain, shamefully ignore and, thus, in\nindirectly accept, that violence against women should\ntoday be the cause of more death and disability than\ncancer, traffic accidents or even war? Can we tolerate\nthis situation? As a woman and as a human being, I say\nthat the answer is an unambiguous no.\nIn the same vein, the International Criminal Court\nis an essential legal instrument to ensure that the most\nserious violations of human rights do not go\nunpunished. With its subsidiary jurisdiction, the Court\nrepresents the most significant advance in the\n16\n\nstructuring of the international community since the\nSan Francisco Charter.\nIn the framework of this reinvigoration of law,\nthe Organization must pay special attention to\nchallenges stemming from new technologies, in\nparticular those associated with biotechnology. We do\nnot want uncontrolled science with unclear objectives\nto determine the future shape of our societies, bringing\nto life the terrifying allegory of Aldous Huxley's Brave\nNew World. Spain, which along with other countries of\nthe European Union has ratified the Oviedo\nConvention on Human Rights and Biomedicine, a\nprotocol to which bans cloning for research purposes,\nrecalls the fact that article 11 of the Universal\nDeclaration on The Human Genome and Human\nRights, approved by the United Nations Educational,\nScientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in\n1997 and unanimously endorsed by the General\nAssembly in 1998, already bans human cloning for\nreproductive purposes. Therefore, it is necessary to go\nbeyond that prohibition in a new convention.\nIn spite of these encouraging results,\nunderdevelopment, poverty, the existence of weapons\nof mass destruction and regional crises  in particular\nthe crisis in the Middle East  constitute some of the\noutstanding tasks before us. Allow me briefly to review\nthese issues in order, in the words of Pablo Neruda,\nnot to fill our hearts with salt, but to walk in\nknowledge.'\nIn the difficult struggle for development, we\nshould all invest both our efforts and our hopes. In that\nregard, I would like to reiterate what was said\nyesterday with regard to the Monterrey and the\nJohannesburg summits and the New Partnership for\nAfrica's Development (NEPAD), for poverty is fought\nby recognizing human rights and freedoms and by\npromoting the rule of law.\nIn mentioning development, I wish to stress once\nagain the importance of women in the world. Their\nlagging behind, and their explicit or implicit secondary\nstatus  their role in general  are very often patently\nunfair. This situation is the source of the shortcomings\nof many societies. Let us recall that the advancement of\nwomen is not only an obvious right, it also likely\nrepresents the most effective and promising strategy to\ncope with the persistent nightmare of\nunderdevelopment.\nIn any case, poverty must be eradicated wherever\nit exists, both in the poorest countries as well as in\nmiddle-income countries, which are joining the global\neconomy while undergoing fragile political and\neconomic processes. Middle-income countries\nfrequently have large pockets of poverty and are\nespecially vulnerable to global economic swings. Latin\nAmerica is a good example of a continent where in the\nlast decade an important and successful effort has been\nmade to put in place democratic regimes, foster\neconomic growth and open up to the world economy. It\nis crucial to ensure continued international support\nwhen this process is threatened by temporary\ndifficulties.\nDisarmament no doubt poses another challenge\nfor all of us, notwithstanding the progress made in the\nareas of anti-personnel mines, small arms and chemical\nweapons. In this context, Spain is following with\nunderstandable concern the development of events\nregarding Iraq. For the sake of international security\nand stability and for the welfare of the Iraqi people, we\nhope that the announced immediate and unconditional\nreturn of arms inspectors in accordance with Security\nCouncil resolutions 687 (1991) and 1284 (1999) will\nbecome a reality. The Iraqi regime is currently\nflagrantly violating those resolutions. Arms inspections\nmust be accompanied by Iraqi guarantees to the\ninternational community that it will destroy its\nweapons of mass destruction. That is the only possible\npath towards lifting the sanctions and normalizing\nIraq's relations with the international community. If\nnecessary, the international community must assume its\nresponsibilities and ensure compliance with the\nresolutions adopted by the body that embodies\ninternational legitimacy.\nThe citizens of our States fail to understand why\nsome regional crisis continue indefinitely, causing\ndespair among the peoples who suffer from them and\ngenerating a sense of injustice that fuels hatred and\nbitterness. Encouraging progress has undoubtedly been\nmade, especially in Africa, and we spoke of that\nprogress yesterday. But the Middle East crisis\ncontinues to be in all our minds.\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338\n(1973), and 1397 (2002), the principles of the Madrid\nConference and the agreements between the parties\nhave established a framework for peace between\nIsraelis and Palestinians. How many Palestinians and\nIsraelis will still have to die and how many\n17\n\ninternational resolutions will we need before Palestine\nand Israel can live together as States in peace and\nmutual respect? It is necessary to complete the peace\nprocess; that is the goal of the negotiating efforts of the\nQuartet, which Spain supports.\nWe must counter these crises with our ability to\ncarry out dialogue and negotiation. Spain has promoted\nintegration mechanisms, particularly in the\nMediterranean region through the Barcelona process.\nIn that regard, Spain has always given special attention\nto its contacts with the Arab world, with which it\nmaintains special relationships. In that context, I would\nlike to make a brief reference to our relations with the\nMaghreb.\nSpain is among the Maghreb's foremost\ncommercial partners, in addition to being one of the\nmain investor countries there. Hundreds of thousands\nof citizens from Maghreb countries live in Spain,\nmaking up Spain's largest resident foreign community\nand contributing to the creation of wealth through their\nwork and dynamism. Spain has therefore for many\nyears made the Maghreb the main focus of its\ninternational cooperation policy.\nAll of this means that maintaining strong and\nfruitful relations with Morocco is a strategic priority of\nSpanish foreign policy. The clearest expression of that\npriority is the treaty of friendship, cooperation and\ngood-neighbourliness that exists between our countries.\nThe Government of Spain wishes to promote relations\nin all areas and once again to place those relations on\nthe level they deserve, given the proximity of our two\npeoples and the importance of our common interests. I\nam confident that my Moroccan colleague's next visit\nto Madrid will be a good opportunity to make progress\nalong that path.\nIn any case, I wish to clearly emphasize here\ntoday that the autonomous communities of Ceuta and\nMelilla are an integral part of Spain, on an equal\nfooting with the rest of Spain's autonomous\ncommunities. They are therefore an integral part of the\nEuropean Union. Their citizens are represented in the\nSpanish and European Parliaments, with the same\nstanding and in the same manner as the rest of our\ncitizens.\nThe tasks before the Organization require that its\nmechanisms function adequately. Spain looks forward\nto the Secretary-General's forthcoming report on the\nreform of the Organization. We support in-depth\nreform of the Security Council that addresses all\naspects of the matter.\nBefore ending my statement, I cannot fail to\nmention the question of Gibraltar and the recurrent\nmandates of the General Assembly urging Spain and\nthe United Kingdom to continue their bilateral\nnegotiations to find a permanent solution to this\ndispute. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that\nduring the past year the Governments of both countries\nhave deployed intense negotiating efforts in this regard,\nand that we have made substantial progress. We intend\nto continue these negotiations in a constructive spirit so\nthat as soon as possible we may reach a satisfactory\nand comprehensive agreement that takes into account\nthe legitimate interests of the residents of the colony as\nwell as the traditional United Nations doctrine with\nregard to Gibraltar, a doctrine confirmed year after year\nby the resolutions of both the General Assembly and\nthe Special Committee of 24.\nLet us be clear: now, the beginning of the\ntwenty-first century, is the time to resolve this\nquestion, in accordance with the relevant resolutions\ncalling for the implementation of the principle of\nterritorial integrity. For all of those reasons, we\ncondemn attempts to interfere with the natural\ndevelopment of such negotiations, actions that openly\nand flagrantly violate that doctrine.\nI cannot conclude without giving a very warm\nwelcome, and offering my country's cooperation, to\nSwitzerland, as well as to the Democratic Republic of\nTimor-Leste, which will soon become a Member of the\nUnited Nations.\nOur meetings within this building give rise to\nmany plans, ideas and, of course, words. But they also\ngive rise to action. The action of the United Nations, as\nwell as that of each of its Member States, must not be\nconfined within these walls; millions of people depend\non our ability to implement all that has been discussed\nhere in order to enjoy a better life or simply to protect\nthe life they have. Spain is fully aware of this\nresponsibility and we are ready to work alongside other\nMembers of the Organization so that words may be\ntransformed into deeds, and deeds transformed into\nresults.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf\nof the President of the Republic of Haiti, His\nExcellency Mr. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, I should first of\nall like to congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan on his election to\nthe presidency of the fifty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly. He can be assured of the Haitian\ndelegation's full support in the exercise of his duties. I\nshould also like to congratulate his predecessor, His\nExcellency Mr. Han Seung-soo, on the talent he\ndemonstrated in conducting the work of the fifty-sixth\nsession.\nI should also like to pay tribute to Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, Secretary-General of the Organization, for his\nceaseless efforts to maintain international peace and\nsecurity.\nIn addition, I wish to welcome the Swiss\nConfederation and East Timor to the Organization as\nStates Members. Undoubtedly, their presence in this\ninstitution will contribute significantly to the pursuit of\nthe noble objectives of the United Nations.\nThe entire world has just commemorated the first\nanniversary of the tragedy of 11 September 2001. The\nGovernment and the people of Haiti again express their\nsympathy to the people and the Government of the\nUnited States. We continue to share the distress of all\nthe families of the victims of that barbarity, which\ntouched all races, cultures and nations of the world. It\nis humanity that has been struck, and humanity will\nalways remember that sad event.\nThe Government of Haiti reaffirms its\ncondemnation of terrorism, one of the most flagrant\nforms of human rights violations. Terrorism represents\na grave danger, and we must unite all our efforts to\ncombat it in all its forms and manifestations. In that\nconnection, my Government reaffirms its commitment\nto supporting the relevant resolutions of the\nOrganization as an expression of its respect for the\nprecepts of international law.\nReform of the Security Council, which has been\ndiscussed for some time, is, more than ever before, of\nthe highest importance. Haiti continues to call for more\n25\n\nopenness in its operations and for greater participation\nin its decision-making.\nThe Charter of the United Nations, ratified by all\nStates Members, evokes the sacred principles of\nmaintaining international peace and security as well as\nthe right of peoples to determine their own future with\nthe leaders they choose.\nIn that connection, the Government of Haiti\nexpresses its grave concern at the escalating violence in\nthe Middle East, and particularly the Israeli-Palestinian\nconflict. The Haitian Government supports the creation\nof a Palestinian State, while recognizing Israel's right\nto exist within safe and internationally recognized\nborders. We call on the parties to settle their\ndifferences peacefully through dialogue and diplomatic\nmeans.\nIn the same spirit, we appreciate the negotiations\ninitiated between the two Republics of Korea, and we\nare in favour of a rapprochement between the\npopulations on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.\nDespite Iraq's acceptance of the unconditional\nreturn of the inspectors, the Haitian Government is\nconcerned at developments in the Iraqi situation. In\norder to deal effectively with this problem, the relevant\nUnited Nations resolutions must be applied.\nRegionalization is an important tool to facilitate\npartnerships among States as they strive to ensure the\nwell-being of their people. In that context, my country\nis gratified by its full integration within the Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM), where it will contribute to\nthe socio-economic development of the region.\nHumanity today is facing serious challenges,\nincluding poverty, the AIDS pandemic, drug abuse,\nhunger and illiteracy. The population of the least\ndeveloped countries is about 614 million, one third of\nwhom have to survive on less than $1 per day.\nCharacterized by weak institutions and an inadequate\ninfrastructure, those countries are affected by many\ndifferent problems. The sub-human conditions under\nwhich many of their people live are a source of social\ntension. Poverty increases in proportion as capital\ndecreases.\nWe returned from the Doha, Monterrey and\nJohannesburg summits with renewed hope.\nExpectations are great, in keeping with the promises\nmade. It is not enough, however, to hope for\nsustainable development. We must have the will to\nimplement measures to attain it and respect the\ncommitments undertaken. Leaders must take action to\nensure sustainable development, which is in the best\ninterests of our peoples.\nEducation and training can roll back poverty, free\npeople from ignorance and put them on track to social\nand economic progress. On the basis of that conviction,\nthe President of Haiti, Mr. Jean Bertrand Aristide,\nofficially launched, on 7 September 2001, a national\nliteracy campaign, to which he attributes overriding\nimportance. The goal of this large-scale and ambitious\ninitiative is to help 3 million people learn to read\nbefore 1 January 2004, when we will celebrate the\nbicentennial of our independence. The head of State is\ncounting on the active participation of our literate\ncitizens in the work of national construction.\nGlaring injustices are built into our country's\ntraditional socio-economic system. These injustices are\nresponsible for wide disparities between the various\nsocial sectors \u2014 a situation that contributes in large\npart to the anachronistic nature of the general\nstructures of our country, which is the only least\ndeveloped country in the Americas.\nAgainst that background, the Government has\nbeen doing its utmost to fight the financial embargo,\nwhich the international community imposed in\nresponse to the controversy of the elections of 1 May\n2000. Unfortunately, it is the most vulnerable sectors of\nsociety that are penalized by those unjustified\nsanctions.\nThe recent adoption by the Permanent Council of\nthe Organization of American States (OAS) of\nresolution 822 in support of strengthening the\ndemocratic process in Haiti has opened up encouraging\nprospects for our country in beginning to move towards\nnormalization.\nMy Government is determined to stay the course\nin ensuring that elections remain a crucial element of\nthat advance. We have great expectations of the\ninternational community's support in this regard. In\nthis context, we are hoping for assistance, and for\nelection observers in particular. At the same time, in\nthe spirit of resolution 822, we appeal once again as a\nmatter of urgency for an end to the financial embargo.\nThe adoption of OAS resolution 822, which\ndemonstrates the commitment to Haiti of a number of\nOAS member countries, constitutes a step in the right\n26\n\ndirection. We would like to draw attention to that\nexpression of fraternal solidarity.\nWe are also grateful to the States members of\nOAS whose joint efforts made possible the adoption of\nthat consensus resolution, in particular the Federal\nRepublic of Brazil, which currently coordinates the\nLatin American Integration Association and OAS\ngroups, and the Central American countries. We would\nlike to make special mention of our neighbour, the\nDominican Republic, which has continued to reaffirm\nits solidarity with Haiti during this difficult period \u2014\nsolidarity that is manifested in different ways wherever\nthe Haitian cause is discussed and needs to be\ndefended. Above all, we would like to thank our sister\nnations in CARICOM, whose delegations to the OAS\nco-sponsored, with Haiti, the draft resolution, thereby\nmaintaining the spirit of fraternal generosity, as is their\ncustom.\nDuring the crisis, a number of countries Members\nof the United Nations, in particular Japan and Cuba,\ncontinued to cooperate with Haiti. Despite the embargo\nand the other difficulties that it has to deal with, Cuba\nis enthusiastically pursuing a programme of\ncooperation with Haiti, in particular in the areas of\nhealth and agriculture. The Haitian people owe a debt\nof gratitude to all of those countries for their\nexpressions of solidarity in our quest for dignity and\ncollective affirmation.\nOAS resolution 822 provides the entire nation\nwith an opportunity; it holds out the potential for\nprogress for all the Haitian people. In the context of the\nforthcoming celebrations of two centuries of\nindependence, Haiti needs to galvanize its collective\nenergy so that we can build our national home. To that\nend, the Haitian Government will hold an ongoing\ndialogue and continue to practise openness and\nflexibility, as called for by President Aristide. In that\nspirit, despite our well-known scarcity of resources, it\nhas decided to compensate the victims of 17 December\n2001, in accordance with OAS resolutions 806 and\n822. Likewise, President Aristide will continue to call\non the opposition to observe a patriotic truce in order\nto facilitate the rehabilitation of the country and\nsupport the Haitian people.\nIn this context, my country appeals once again for\nus to place human beings at the forefront of relations\namong various countries. This planet \u2014 the theatre of\nour common destiny \u2014 can thus become a world fit for\nall of its inhabitants through the advent of a\n\u201chumanism without borders\u201d. On that basis of that\nconviction, the Republic of Haiti, on the eve of the\nbicentenary of our independence, invites the\ninternational community to help us to set in motion a\nprocess that will enable us to overcome the shocking\nreversals of the past and bring us into the modern\nworld.\nI hope that all of the nations of the world share\nthese exalted hopes and that they will join us in\ncelebrating this important event, to which the\nGovernment and the people of Haiti invite them, in\nJanuary 2004.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me start by\nsaying how pleased I am to see a representative of my\nown country presiding over this session of the General\nAssembly. It is the first time that the Czech Republic\nhas had the honour of chairing this supreme body of\nthe United Nations. I am grateful to all who made this\npossible by supporting our aspirations. I wish you, Mr.\nPresident, every success in the performance of this\nimportant function, a function which was raised to such\na high standard by your predecessor, Han Seung-soo of\nthe Republic of Korea.\nRepresenting the Government which assumed its\nfunction this July, I would like to confirm the\ncontinuity of Czech foreign policy, with its emphasis\non the Euro-Atlantic dimension but also with a truly\nglobal reach and a strong involvement in multilateral\ncooperation. I should also mention that the Government\nof the Czech Republic has made its active participation\nin the fight against terrorism and against the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction one of its\ntop priorities.\nA year ago at this time, the whole world was\nshocked by the horrific terrorist attacks on the United\nStates of America on 11 September. The appalling\ndimensions of those attacks revealed the nature of the\nnew threats that the international community is\ncurrently facing. Our response must be firm. We must\nmove from the policy of containment to the policy of\nactive struggle against international terrorism. At the\n24\n\nsame time, we need to discuss issues that may be the\nsource of, or a fertile ground for, violent acts of a\nsimilar nature.\nThis November, Prague will host the summit of\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the\nEuro-Atlantic Partnership Council. The Czech\nRepublic will support NATO's enlargement to include\nadditional countries from Central and Eastern Europe.\nAt the same time, we are aware of the importance of\nNATO and European Union relations with the Russian\nFederation, Ukraine and the Mediterranean countries.\nWe also anticipate that the Prague summit will mark an\nimportant milestone in the history of the alliance in\nconnection with its transformation to meet such current\nsecurity challenges as international terrorism and other\nasymmetric threats. We are convinced that these steps\nwill contribute to strengthening the stability and\nsecurity of the world as a whole.\nThe Czech Republic is paying great attention to\nthe problem of Iraq. We advocate the unconditional\nimplementation of the relevant Security Council\nresolutions, including those concerning the renewal of\narms inspections, disarmament, the release of detained\nKuwaiti citizens and the return of confiscated Kuwaiti\nproperty. The current regime in Iraq, because of its\nefforts to develop and produce weapons of mass\ndestruction and its failure to comply with the will of\nthe international community, represents an enormous\nrisk not only for the security and stability of the Middle\nEast region, but for the international community as a\nwhole. I can assure the Assembly that the Czech\nRepublic supports the peaceful resolution of disputes in\ninternational relations.\nHowever, our nation has its tragic experience\nwith never-ending concessions to aggressive regimes.\nWe must not forget that peace must sometimes be\ndefended by force. The Czech Republic considers the\nletter by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq to the\nSecretary-General as a reaction to the firm stand of,\nand the pressure by, the international community. This\npressure on the Iraqi regime must continue until all\nSecurity Council requirements are met in full.\nThe Czech Republic is also closely following the\ndevelopments in the Middle East. Let me recall that our\npreference in this regard has always been for a peaceful\nand just settlement of the problem in line with Security\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 1403\n(2002). The only meaningful option is to continue\nnegotiations with the objective of stabilizing the\ncurrent situation as a step towards achieving complete\nand lasting peace in this region. The Czech Republic\nshares the vision of peaceful co-existence between\nIsrael and an independent and democratic Palestinian\nState, based on mutual trust and arrangements covering\nall security concerns. In this regard, we welcome the\npromising results of the Quartet meeting held earlier\nthis week.\nWith regard to peace and security, we recently\nwitnessed some encouraging progress in the resolution\nof armed conflicts in Africa, namely, in Angola, Sierra\nLeone, Liberia and the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, as well as in other areas, including the Balkans\nand Afghanistan. We welcome and support the positive\nchanges. For example, the Czech Republic is devoting\nlong-term attention to relations with the States of\nSouth-Eastern Europe and to the stabilization efforts of\nthe international community in the western Balkans.\nThis year, the Czech Republic became a participant in\nthe Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe, which we\nregard as an important instrument for the economic\nrenewal and reconstruction of the region.\nAs for Afghanistan, we consider peace, stability\nand democratization a key factor, both for the further\npeaceful development of the entire region, as well as\nfor the wider international context of the fight against\nterrorism. The international community has to increase\nits efforts to stabilize the security situation and support\nthe economic renewal of Afghanistan, including the\nbreaking of its economy's dependence on the\ncultivation of opium.\nImportant components of the United Nations\nagenda include the areas of disarmament, arms control\nand non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nThe Czech Republic supports the process of the gradual\nreduction and destruction of nuclear arms within the\nframework of the ongoing process of the\nimplementation and achievement of the universality of\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons and the coming into force of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Similarly, the\nCzech Republic is working to achieve both the\nuniversality and rigorous implementation of the\nChemical Weapons Convention, including the\ndestruction of existing arsenals, and the strengthening\nof the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. We\nalso wish to see a renewal in the activities of the\nConference on Disarmament and the commencement of\n25\n\nsubstantive talks on a fissile materials cut-off treaty.\nWe invite member States of the Conference to take a\ndecision concerning the enlargement of its\nmembership.\nThe Czech Republic supports steps to strengthen\nthe authority and effectiveness of the United Nations.\nThis includes the reform and enlargement of the\nSecurity Council, the revitalization of the General\nAssembly, adapting peacekeeping operations in line\nwith the Brahimi report, efforts to transform the culture\nof reaction to a culture of prevention and making\nchanges in the Economic and Social Council and its\nsubsidiary bodies, among other things, as a response to\nthe challenges posed by goals of the Millennium\nDeclaration and recent major United Nations\nconferences.\nOne of the major challenges currently facing the\ninternational community is to ensure that all countries\nhave fair access to the benefits of globalization. Issues\nsuch as development assistance and cooperation, debt\nrelief for highly indebted developing countries and\nnon-discriminatory participation in a multilateral trade\nsystem, together with what we call good governance,\nare key both for further economic progress in many\nparts of the world and for preserving favourable living\nconditions for future generations.\nIn that context, the Czech Republic welcomes the\nsuccessful conclusion of the Monterrey Conference on\nFinancing for Development, held earlier this year, and\nof the World Summit on Sustainable Development,\nheld in Johannesburg just a few weeks ago. The\nSummit reinforced the determination of the\ninternational community to pursue the goal of\nsustainable development and, most importantly,\nstressed implementation, time-bound goals and specific\ncommitments, responsibility and accountability. Let us\nnow make sure that the core message of Johannesburg\nis not forgotten. Let us hope that the Summit is\nfollowed by concrete actions at the global, regional,\nnational and local levels, including through initiatives\nsuch as the New Partnership for Africa's Development.\nThe Czech Republic attaches great significance to\nthe strengthening of international law and respect for\nhuman rights. We are determined to seek an early\nconclusion of a general United Nations convention on\ninternational terrorism. We also welcome the\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court. I\nbelieve that the Czech Republic will join the large\ngroup of parties to the Rome Statute in the near future.\nThe Czech Republic is conscious of the\ncontribution of the United Nations to promoting respect\nfor, and protection of, human rights. We call for a\nconsistent approach to fulfilling the obligations entered\ninto, in particular in relation to the advancement of\nwomen and the protection of the rights of the child,\nincluding in situations of armed conflict. We advocate\nthe prevention and gradual elimination of all forms of\nracism and discrimination, including that against\nmembers of ethnic or religious minorities, persons with\ndisabilities and older persons and a ban on torture and\nthe death penalty. We are paying very close attention to\nthe draft optional protocol to the Convention against\nTorture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading\nTreatment or Punishment. The Czech Republic will\nactively promote the adoption of the draft protocol by\nthis session of the General Assembly.\nThis session of the General Assembly will be\nremembered, inter alia, for the admission of two new\nmembers, Switzerland and East Timor. I welcome\nSwitzerland most cordially to the United Nations\nfamily, and I look forward to welcoming East Timor.\nTheir entry into the Organization represents a further\nstep towards completing the universality of the\nmembership of the United Nations, the achievement of\nwhich the Czech Republic unanimously supports and\nwhich represents further proof of the vitality of our\nOrganization.\nI could stop here. But before I finish, allow me to\ntake advantage of this occasion to raise two issues.\nFirst, I would like to reaffirm the continued interest of\nthe Czech Republic in supporting the activities of the\nUnited Nations Information Centre in Prague, which\nlast year was housed in new premises \u2014 the so-called\nPrague United Nations House \u2014 also seating\nrepresentative bodies of other organizations of the\nUnited Nations system. And finally, on behalf of the\npeople of the Czech Republic, I wish to warmly thank\nall who generously provided humanitarian and other\ntypes of assistance to my country after it had been\nstruck by devastating floods last August. At that\ncritical time, we saw an enormous wave of\ninternational solidarity, and the floods thus contributed\nto a coming together among ourselves, our neighbours\nand the rest of the world.\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like, through\nyou, Sir, to congratulate Jan Kavan on his election as\nPresident of the General Assembly and to assure him of\nour delegation's cooperation as he undertakes his\nimportant responsibilities this year.\nYesterday, people the world over paused to\nremember the victims of the tragic events of one year\nago. I had the opportunity of attending the interfaith\nservice yesterday, where the President of the General\nAssembly and the Secretary-General spoke movingly\nabout how the commemoration of that event must\nreinforce this institution's vocation as the forum\ndedicated to world peace.\nCanadians entirely subscribe to the sentiments\nthat were there expressed. The attacks of last\nSeptember were a cruel and devastating blow to the\nUnited States and, indeed, to us all. I am proud to say\nthat Canadians stood in solidarity with our closest ally\nat that terrible moment. When the terrorists struck that\nday, they were also attacking the very principles of\ninternational law, security and humanitarianism that are\nembodied in the United Nations Charter. We believe\nthat our ultimate response to the challenges of 11\nSeptember is thus to rededicate ourselves to our beliefs\nand to the principles upon which the United Nations\nwas founded.\n(spoke in French)\nNow, more than ever, the main challenge for each\nof our countries and for the United Nations is to\nmanage our interdependence. Environmental\ndegradation and endemic poverty, the proliferation of\ndisease and epidemics, the increasing threat of\nterrorism and organized crime  these are serious,\ncomplex issues that no one nation can confront alone.\nTo succeed, our countries must work together, while\nalso drawing on the expertise of civil society. Such\ninteraction is a formidable challenge and one that the\nUnited Nations is best suited to meet.\nRecognition of our interdependence in no way\nthreatens our respective sovereignty. In fact, it gives\neach of us even more tangible means to act and to\nsucceed through the sharing of our information,\nresources and initiatives.\nThe principles of multilateralism are articulated\nwith vigour and resolve in the Millennium Declaration,\nwhich assigns a decisive role to the United Nations\nCharter  and rightly so, for it is much more than our\nconstitution. Indeed, it is our heart and soul. It\nreconciles national interests with the highest moral and\nethical standards that must govern the actions of each\nState. For us, the Charter is the key to unlock the door\nto the world of peace, security and justice that we hope\nto build.\nThe terrorist threat leads us to work together and,\ntragically, illustrates the extent of our interdependence.\nIt demonstrates the urgency of finding solutions that\nare equal to the task at hand and whose effectiveness\nhinges on new partnerships among our countries. Our\nreaction to terrorism must be steadfast, to be sure, and\nwe must make no concession to the agents of terror, but\nif we want our reaction to be truly effective, it must\nenhance both national security and respect for basic\nrights. In fact, democratic governance and security find\ntheir most solid foundation in societies in which rights\nand freedoms are respected and where, as a result,\ndissidence more often than not takes constructive,\nrather than violent forms.\nWhat is more, the fight against terrorism\nchallenges us to find ways to open our hearts and\nminds to the diversity of our world, its cultures and its\nreligions. Now more than ever, we must promote\ndialogue, understanding and tolerance with respect to\nother people. In this way, we will help to eradicate at\nits source much of the pain that all too often translates\n26\n\ninto rising hatred, extremism and fanaticism of all\nsorts.\nMultilateralism has definitely proven its worth\nover the past year. For example, dozens of countries\nhave offered their resources and experience to\nAfghanistan as members of the coalition against\nterrorism or of the Afghanistan Support Group. They\nhave also contributed to the various United Nations\nprogrammes seeking to establish political stability and\nrepresentative Government.\nThe G8 Global Partnership Against the Spread of\nWeapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, concluded\nat Kananaskis in June, is another concrete example of\nour joint commitment to battling terrorism and other\nthreats to peace. Canada, as Chair of the G8, was a\nstrong advocate of this major effort designed to\nstrengthen international security and strategic stability.\nCanada will continue to work to make this initiative a\nsuccess.\nAt all times, Canada is ready to offer its support\nwherever it is needed and we encourage the\ninternational community to continue to do likewise. We\nalso believe that the multilateral approach is useful in\naddressing the obvious challenges posed by sustainable\ndevelopment. In this regard, the consensus that\nemerged from the Monterrey Conference calls on all\ncountries to work together to forge broader\npartnerships between developed and developing\ncountries.\nIn this regard, the situation in Africa cries out for\naction. For too long now, inaction has taken a heavy\ntoll in terms of human suffering. However, hope is\nbeginning to shine through. The New Partnership for\nAfrica's Development, devised by African leaders\ndetermined to meet the challenges of self-development\nand endorsed at Canada's urging-during the G8 summit\nin Kananaskis, seeks to provide the people of Africa\nwith conditions founded on good governance and\ndemocracy, while ending their marginalization and\noffering them the chance to achieve prosperity.\nAs we meet here today, the Israeli-Palestinian\ncrisis remains at its all too familiar impasse, despite the\nfact that everyone knows what is needed to restore\npeace. We all know that the targeting of civilians must\nstop, that the security of Israel must be assured, that\nsettlement-building must end, that the humanitarian\nneeds of the Palestinian people must be met, that the\nPalestinian Authority must reform itself democratically\nand that the peace negotiations must resume. We all\nknow, in sum, that a road to a peaceful future must be\nbuilt, a future in which two independent, viable, secure\nand democratic States, Israel and Palestine, live side by\nside in peace and security.\nCanada calls on the Palestinian Authority and the\nGovernment of Israel to start back on the road to peace.\nThe people and the Government of Canada will\naccompany them and support them every step of the\nway.\nWe also meet here today in an atmosphere of\ndeepening tension caused by Iraq's continued flouting\nof the will of the international community and by the\ndiffering opinions that prevail around us on how to\naddress this situation and bring the crisis to a close. Let\nthere be no doubt: at the origin of today's tensions is\nthe persistent refusal of the Iraqi Government to\ncomply with its obligations to us all under Security\nCouncil resolutions. For the past seven years, Iraq has\nrefused to demonstrate that it has abandoned its\nchemical, biological and nuclear weapons programmes,\nand it remains even today unwilling to do so. But let\nthere also be no doubt that bringing Iraq into\nconformity with its international obligations must be\nthe work of us all acting together.\nWe believe that our ability to find a solution to\nthis challenge, one that is consistent with and, indeed,\nthat reinforces the international framework that we\nhave so painstakingly constructed since the last\ndevastating World War, will define this generation and\ncreate precedents that may determine the future\ndirection of the world. It is with this in mind that\nCanada welcomes the powerful message delivered here\ntoday by President Bush affirming his country's\ncommitment to work with the Security Council in\nresolving this serious threat to our collective peace and\nsecurity.\nWe therefore urge Iraq to seize this opportunity\nwithout delay, and to grant immediate and\nunconditional access to United Nations weapons\ninspectors in compliance with its Security Council\nobligations. The onus is clearly on the Government of\nIraq to take this step now. The onus is equally on us to\nensure that our international institutions emerge from\nthis crisis reinforced and strengthened.\nSuch institutions may well be new, as in the case\nof the International Criminal Court (ICC), a body that\nhas the potential to ensure the integrity of our\n27\n\ninternational legal system, upon which so much\ndepends for the peaceful resolution of our differences.\nThis week I had the privilege of attending the inaugural\nmeeting of the Assembly of States Parties here in New\nYork with many in this Hall and was encouraged by the\ndepth of international political and public support that\nexists for this important new body.\nThe people of the world want an end to impunity.\nThey insist that their leaders no longer turn a blind eye\nto gross violations of international humanitarian law\nlike those we witnessed in the past century. Immunity\nfrom the law is simply no longer acceptable. The States\nparties to the ICC Statute are more than willing to put\ninto action the proposition that we can best enforce\nrules of law that we have arrived at by our common\naccord   those indeed that we are willing to have\ninvoked against us as well. For the 79 States parties\nthat attended the Assembly of States Parties and the\nmany observer States close to ratifying the Rome\nStatute, our objective remains to work resolutely and\ncooperatively to make the Court a reality.\nThe International Criminal Court represents a\nmajor change in the way the world works. The times\nwe live in demand many such innovative approaches.\nFor example, in response to a call from the Secretary-\nGeneral, Canada, along with others, launched the\nindependent International Commission on Intervention\nand State Sovereignty. Its landmark report, entitled\n`The Responsibility to Protect', has shifted the\nparameters of the debate from divisions over\nintervention toward agreement on the responsibility of\na State to protect its people. The report holds that\nsovereignty entails responsibilities as well as rights:\nthat sovereignty is responsibility. When States are\nunable or unwilling to afford protection to their own\npeople, the international community has a\nresponsibility to step in temporarily and to provide that\nprotection. The report represents, in our view, an\nopportunity for us to reinforce the United Nations in its\ncollective security mission. It also provides an\noccasion to affirm the fundamental norm-building role\nof the United Nations and to find better ways to\nprevent and, where necessary, alleviate human\nsuffering.\nPart of our shared responsibility to raise the\ncredibility of multilateral institutions is to address their\nshortcomings, including those of the United Nations\nitself. We are greatly encouraged that the Secretary-\nGeneral and his Deputy, Louise Fr\u00c8chette, are\nproposing far-reaching organizational reforms. They\ncan count on Canada's support. We also support reform\nin other areas, notably in respect to the nearly\nmoribund Disarmament Commission and its glacial\nprogress on issues of non-proliferation, arms control\nand disarmament, where recent gains such as the\nUnited Nations Programme of Action on small arms\nand light weapons and the negotiations on an\ninternational code of conduct on missiles are being\novershadowed by a myriad of compliance problems.\nCertainly, there are problems with multilateralism\nand the institutions we have created, but that should\nnot cause us to doubt the desirability of an effective\nrules-based system. Our objective should be to address\nthese shortcomings where we see them and reform\nwhat we must, and in the process answer the criticisms\nof those suspicious of an interdependent world. We will\npersuade the sceptics only by building better\ninstitutions to implement the international rule of law\nand globally arrived-at solutions to our common\nproblems.\nLet us therefore embrace cooperation, not\ndivision. Let us expand our sovereignty by pooling it.\nLet us be partners in the larger enterprise of building\npeace and freedom. No one country can meet all the\nchallenges of our times on its own. Let us have\nconfidence in our common humanity. Let us make the\nUnited Nations our principal instrument of peace. I\npledge to the Assembly today that Canada will spare no\neffort in so doing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI bring to the\nAssembly warm greetings from President Kessai H.\nNote.\nOn behalf of the Republic of the Marshall\nIslands, I am honoured to congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan\non his election to this high office. Let me also take this\nopportunity to thank the Secretary-General for the hard\nwork that he and the Secretariat have undertaken in\npreparation for this General Assembly.\nI am also very pleased to extend a warm welcome\nand congratulations from the Marshall Islands to the\npeople of Switzerland and of East Timor, as the newest\nMembers of the United Nations.\nIt is unfortunate that this, the fifty-seventh\nsession of the General Assembly, is meeting in the\nshadow of the anniversary of the terrorist attacks that\nshocked our host country \u2014 and the world \u2014 on 11\nSeptember 2001. Modern terrorism is an issue of\nconcern for all peoples, regardless of nationality or\nreligion. It is an issue that no nation can afford to\nignore.\nWhile sharing in the feelings of terror, horror and\nsorrow caused by the terrorist attacks in the United\nStates, the people of the Marshall Islands are hopeful\nthat the Member States of the United Nations will\ncontinue to join together in working towards global\npeace and security. I urge this body, which collectively\nrepresents the moral force of all Member States, to do\neverything in its power to eliminate the threat of\nterrorism.\nI am pleased to announce that the Marshall\nIslands has recently completed a process of national\npriority-setting and of assessing Government policy.\nWe have thoroughly reviewed the state of our nation\nthrough the holding of a National Economic and Social\nSummit, whose findings have formed the basis for our\nlong-term sustainable development plan, entitled\n\u201cRepublic of the Marshall Islands Vision 2018\u201d.\nThis process of review was guided by\nconsultations with all stakeholders and all sectors of\nour society. Extensive discussions and interviews were\ncarried out in order to ensure that all members of the\nMarshall Islands community would have the\nopportunity to contribute to our vision for the future.\nThe Marshall Islands Government has determined\nthat all development policies and objectives will be\nguided by the vision generated by the Summit, and we\nare now in the process of implementing the core ideals\nof this blueprint for sustainable development.\nIn developing our national vision, the Marshall\nIslands Government has also responded to the\ninternational agenda as set by the United Nations. We\nhave ensured that our policies will reflect the all-\nimportant priorities of good governance, respect for\nfundamental human rights, protection of the\nenvironment, and conservation of natural resources. We\nhave also taken account of social development\nobjectives and of the need to invest in the areas of\nhealth and education. We are confident that, by linking\nour national priorities to the international agenda, the\ncorrect policy decisions will be made.\nDuring the 1990s the Marshall Islands went\nthrough a period of structural adjustment and reform at\nthe demand of the international donor community. We\nhave faithfully carried out these costly and socially\ndisruptive reforms, in the hope that some form of\nreward would be forthcoming. We now have in place a\nforward-looking and pragmatic set of policies, and we\nare eager to translate them into action for the\nbetterment of the lives of our people. Yet there are few\nwho are willing to assist us in achieving this goal.\nI therefore stand here, at the fifty-seventh session\nof the General Assembly, to advocate for a new\ninternational paradigm: one that recognizes both the\nunique challenges facing small island developing\nStates such as the Marshall Islands, as well as the\nunique resources and gifts that such nations possess \u2014\nresources that can benefit the whole of the international\ncommunity only through substantive and sustained\npartnerships.\nIt is time to reconceptualize the relationship that\nexists between more established and less-established\nnations, from one of donors and recipients to one of\nmutual beneficiaries and collaborators. Only in this\nway will it be possible fully to realize the promise of\ntrue international cooperation and development.\nThe Marshall Islands has so much in the way of\nnative intellectual, environmental and cultural\nresources to share with the international community.\nWe look forward to creating new forms of partnership\nwith entities around the world \u2014 partnerships that will\nredound to the benefit of the global community and of\nall its residents.\n30\n\nThe partnerships that are most meaningful to us\nare ones of a practical nature. Our communities, and\nthose of many other nations like the Marshall Islands,\nare seeking partnerships of action that offer pragmatic\nand practical solutions that are coordinated and\ntargeted for maximum effect.\nThe Marshall Islands shares challenges that are\nuniquely peculiar to many small island States: a\nprecariously fragile environment that is highly\nsensitive to the threat posed by global warming; a\nnarrow economic base that imposes constraints on the\npotential for progressive and sustainable development;\nand an institutional milieu that is slowly developing the\ncapability of harnessing the benefits of science and\ntechnology.\nIn relation to our international partners, the\nMarshall Islands is particularly concerned about the\nfollowing issues. First of all, we are concerned about\nthe environment. The Marshall Islands Government\nrecognizes the need for a coordinated and\ncomprehensive approach in seeking appropriate\nsolutions to the challenges posed by environmental\ndegradation and pollution.\nWe commend the Barbados Programme of\nAction, which, in conjunction with the outcome forged\nat the Johannesburg Earth Summit, will provide a\nguiding framework for sustainable development for\nsmall island States, such as the Marshall Islands. The\nwide divergence of views expressed in Johannesburg\nposed many challenges, but also produced rich insights\ninto areas where our common strengths lie, and into\nhow these might best be utilized.\nFurther, it is vital that the international\ncommunity recognize the great challenge to life and\nculture that is posed by global climate change. This\nthreat to life and culture is felt most acutely by nations\nsuch as the Marshall Islands \u2014 nations that face the\nvery real threat of complete obliteration if our oceans\nrise by even marginal levels.\nOn behalf of the Marshall Islands, I commend\nthose States that share our concerns and have signed\nand ratified the Kyoto Protocol. May I also urge the\nremaining non-signatory States to consider the vital\nimportance and urgency of this issue. If the\ninternational community does not act now, the future\nwill see the disappearance of many small island\nnations, which in turn will have immeasurable\neconomic, environmental and immigration\nconsequences for the entire global community.\nSecondly, an issue that is particularly relevant to\nthe Marshall Islands is that of nuclear cleanup and non-\nproliferation. The Marshall Islands seeks partnerships\nwith members of the international community that will\nhelp raise to new levels the dialogue about nuclear\nweapons and their testing.\nThe people of the Marshall Islands have suffered\ngreatly at the hands of a world that is continually\npreparing for war. We are restrained by the persisting\nlegacy of toxic nuclear waste, which poses challenges\nfar beyond our financial and scientific capability to\nsolve. Our food chain continues to be affected, and our\ndevelopment is thwarted by our inability to use\ndamaged lands.\nI am pleased to state that the United States\nCongress is currently reviewing our situation, and we\nare hopeful that the outcome will contribute towards\namelioration of this problem. Nevertheless, we believe\nthat our hard-learned lessons can help to inform and\ninstruct the international community in future debates\nabout the use and testing of nuclear weapons.\nAnd thirdly, another issue that is particularly\npertinent for our people is that of oceans and fisheries.\nAs a nation whose entire livelihood depends on the\nresources of the sea, the Marshall Islands Government\npledges its unwavering support for the Law of the Sea\nmanagement regime. In particular, we emphasize the\nimportance of Article 63 (1) of the Convention, which\nspeaks of the need for States to agree on measures\nnecessary to coordinate and ensure the conservation\nand development of shared stocks.\nThe Marshall Islands is also pursuing the\nestablishment of national fisheries industries that will\ngradually enable the replacement of foreign fishing\nfleets; the delineation of our own exclusive economic\nzone; and the establishment of international guidelines\nto protect our oceans for generations of future\nfishermen and the people who count on the work they\ndo for survival.\nI have mentioned only a few of the priorities that\nmy delegation will be seeking to raise at the\nappropriate moment in the upcoming committee\ndebates and in our interactions with United Nations\nagencies and our development partners. There are, of\ncourse, many other issues of concern to both the\n31\n\nMarshall Islands and the international community as a\nwhole \u2014 issues with which all of us will wrestle in the\ncoming years.\nAmong the most important challenges faced by\nthis body is the continued exclusion of the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan from the United Nations. The\nMarshall Islands Government reiterates its concern that\nthe exclusion of a nation of peaceful and law-abiding\ncitizens is not consistent with the inclusive ideal of the\nUnited Nations. I therefore urge each and every one of\nyou, all of us, to overcome our biases and to allow the\nadmission of the Republic of China on Taiwan to the\nUnited Nations.\nAnother important challenge faced by this body is\nthe ongoing conflict in the Middle East. The Marshall\nIslands considers that urgent diplomatic action is\nrequired in order to work towards a peaceful solution\nto this threat to international peace and security.\nThe Marshall Islands wishes to emphasize its\nsupport for the expansion of the United Nations\nSecurity Council. We believe that there should be an\nincrease in the number of both permanent and non-\npermanent members of the Council and that such\nexpansion should include members from both\ndeveloped and developing countries. This would\nsignificantly broaden the representation base of the\nCouncil and thus reinforce its ongoing validity.\nMay I take this opportunity to congratulate the\ninternational community on its support for the newly-\nestablished International Criminal Court. The Marshall\nIslands is hopeful and confident that the Court will\nprove to be a powerful mechanism in the\nadministration of justice at the international level. We\nare, however, currently considering the making of a\nbilateral agreement under Article 98 of the Rome\nStatute and will determine this issue after a careful\nassessment of the implications of such an agreement.\nFinally, I wish to reaffirm the strong commitment\nin fellowship and solidarity of the Marshall Islands\nwith all the Member States of this body.\nLong live the United Nations. God bless the\nUnited Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI\nshould like at the outset to express to you, Sir, on\nbehalf of the Kingdom of Morocco, our sincere\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session and to\nassure you of my delegation's full cooperation with a\nview to achieving a fruitful outcome to the session.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to\nextend greetings to the Swiss Confederation and\ncongratulations on its membership of the Organization.\nGiven the cultural, humanitarian and intellectual\nheritage of that friendly country, its contribution will\nenrich the work of the Organization.\nWe also wish to congratulate Timor-Leste on its\nforthcoming accession to the Organization, and to wish\nthat country every success.\nJust three days have elapsed since the first\nanniversary of the tragic events of 11 September 2001.\nThose events deeply wounded the people of the United\nStates and shook the entire world with horror.\nInternational relations have since entered a new phase\nwhose dimensions and repercussions we are still\nassessing. Those events brought into focus the\ncohesion and solidarity of all segments of the\nAmerican people in the face of such tragedy. They also\nbrought to the fore the effectiveness and usefulness of\nsolidarity and cooperation among States in combating\nterrorism. Indeed, as His Majesty King Mohammed VI\nhas stated, terrorism has no religion or homeland.\nEveryone is aware of the Kingdom of Morocco's firm\n10\n\nstance and its renunciation of terrorism in all its forms,\nas well as its vigorous and concrete commitment to\ncombating this scourge.\nThe gradual disappearance of economic borders\nand barriers to trade, the continued interdependence of\nmarkets and societies, the rapid development of\ninformation and communication technologies and the\nrelegation of certain peoples to the sidelines of the\nworld community have all added new challenges to the\nburdens already carried by numerous countries, in\nparticular those in Africa, which have made great\nsacrifices in order to be integrated into the world trade\nsystem.\nThe African continent, unfortunately, is still a\nstage of tragic, complicated and generally fabricated\nconflicts. While Africa teems with huge natural and\nhuman resources, those very resources paradoxically\nbecome the cause and the fuel of many conflicts. Yet\nthe international community remains hesitant to take\ndecisive and necessary measures likely to create a\nclimate propitious for peace and stability in our\ncontinent.\nSeldom are the underlying reasons for conflict\nand instability in Africa taken into account. Of special\nimportance in that regard are poverty, famine, the\noppression of minorities, intolerance, control of natural\nresources, increased flows of refugees and displaced\npersons and health problems including endemic\ndiseases, in particular HIV/AIDS.\nBut now, to face up to all these challenges, our\ncontinent has established an integrated framework: the\nNew Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD).\nIt will certainly give new impetus to the economic and\nsocial development of the continent. Morocco,\nexpresses its hope that the international community\nwill mobilize all its efforts within the framework of\nthis energetic programme in order to reach effective\nand concrete solutions for solving the problems of our\ncontinent. My country is firmly intent on making an\neffective contribution to this endeavour.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco, convinced of the\norganic link between economic growth and the\nmaintenance of stability and security, has spared no\neffort to help in settling African conflicts. In this vein,\nMorocco, on the initiative of His Majesty King\nMohammed VI, convened a summit of heads of State\nof the Mano River Union, which was held at Rabat on\n27 February 2002. At the summit, the Presidents of the\nsister countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone\nachieved practical results on consolidating regional\npeace, particularly with regard to laying down criteria\nfor confidence-building, border security and\nrevitalizing the work of the general secretariat of the\nMano River Union. Morocco will pursue the necessary\nefforts to restore peace and stability in that region.\nIn the same vein, the Kingdom of Morocco\ncontinues its support for and contribution to the work\nof the United Nations Organization Mission in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), with a\nview to putting an end to conflict in that sisterly\ncountry, conflict which threatens stability in the whole\nregion. In that context, my country, the Kingdom of\nMorocco, welcomed the agreement concluded on 30\nJuly 2002 between the Governments of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo and Rwanda.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco expresses also its\nprofound satisfaction at the restoration of peace and\nstability in the sister country of Angola, which will\nenable that country to rebuild its economy and to fully\nplay its role at the regional, continental and\ninternational levels.\nConcerning the issue of the Moroccan Sahara, the\nKingdom of Morocco would like to recall its constant\ngood will, and its sincere and genuine determination to\nreach a final political solution to this fabricated issue.\nMorocco has always cooperated with the United\nNations in this regard, thus bearing testimony to its full\nunderstanding of and sense of responsibility towards\nthe Organization. Morocco would like also to\nemphasize its readiness to continue its cooperation\nwith the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy,\nMr. James Baker, with the Security Council, in order to\nachieve a lasting political solution to the issue of the\nSahara, in accordance with Security Council resolution\n1429 (2002). Such an approach will pave the way for\nthe creation of propitious conditions for a new dynamic\nin the region of the Arab Maghreb, which will enable it\nto become a stable economic partner that enjoys the\ntrust of other regional groupings.\nIn this context, Morocco has supported the option\nof the framework agreement proposed by Mr. Baker to\nthe Security Council as a basis for a negotiated\npolitical solution for this long-standing conflict. That\noption would preserve the territorial integrity of the\nKingdom of Morocco and its historical sovereignty\nover its land, and would ensure for the population of\n\n\nthe Sahara provinces the exercise of expanded\ncompetencies in the management of their affairs within\nthe framework of regional democratic institutions.\nMorocco accepted this option as a basis for negotiation\nin order to reach a final and lasting political solution to\nthis regional conflict.\nIn the same context, Morocco insists on the\nenforcement of the provisions of Security Council\nresolution 1429 (2002), calling for the immediate\nrelease, without restriction or condition, of all the\n1,260 Moroccans detained in Algeria. Their release has\nbeen demanded unanimously by the international\ncommunity and humanitarian organizations, in the\nforefront of which is the International Committee of\nthe Red Cross (ICRC). Morocco categorically rejects\nany political exploitation of humanitarian issues related\nto the Sahara problem, especially since this concerns\nthe fate of the longest-held detainees in the world.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco is linked to Europe by\nstrong and diverse historic bonds. The strengthening of\nthese bonds with all European countries constitutes a\ncentral tenet of our foreign policy. The Association\nAgreement which has been concluded with the\nEuropean Union, and the other initiatives to strengthen\nMoroccan-European relations at the political,\neconomic, cultural and social levels, reflect Morocco's\ndetermination to enhance this relationship, particularly\nat a time when the European Union is in the process of\nexpanding its membership, something that would open\nnew opportunities and horizons for Moroccan-\nEuropean partnership. This approach not only seeks to\nachieve a bilateral strategic objective between Morocco\nand Europe, but it is also a valuable contribution to\nnurturing relations in the Euro-Mediterranean region,\nwhose security and stability have become paramount\nfor the world.\nMorocco, by virtue of its Mediterranean identity,\nplays a positive role in the strategic, economic and\ncultural formation of a Euro-Mediterranean space, as\nwitnessed by its active participation in the Barcelona\nprocess and in the Agadir initiative announced by His\nMajesty King Mohammed VI for building a free-trade\narea among Arab Mediterranean countries.\nIn that spirit of open-mindedness, responsibility\nand confidence in the future, Morocco aspires to\ndevelop its relations with our neighbouring country,\nSpain, with a view to building the Euro-Mediterranean\nregion and moving forward. Unfortunately, however,\nrecent months have been marked by events that are\ninconsistent with the maintenance of security and\nstability in the region and that are unlikely to serve the\ninterests of the two countries and their peoples.\nMorocco has spared no efforts in avoiding any\nmove likely to affect adversely the steady growth of its\nrelations with Spain, hopes that the upcoming\nMoroccan-Spanish talks, which will take place in\nMadrid this month, will tackle all issues and conflicts\nbetween the two countries, within the framework of\nresponsible, calm and constructive dialogue.\nThe completion of Moroccan territorial integrity\nis an absolute priority for His Majesty King\nMohammed VI and for the entire Moroccan people.\nTherefore, Morocco considers the status of the\noccupied cities of Sebta and Melilia and of the\nneighbouring islands to be an anachronistic instance of\ncolonialism that has no place at the beginning of the\ntwenty-first century.\nMorocco has never ceased, neither at the bilateral\nlevel nor in international forums, to officially demand\nthe recovery of these parts of its national territory that\nare occupied by Spain. In so doing, it has always\nexpressed its readiness to engage in dialogue in order\nto arrive at a solution that would guarantee Morocco's\nsovereign rights and secure the interests of the Spanish\ncommunity in the areas.\nWe fervently hope that the two neighbouring\nkingdoms, Morocco and Spain, which are bound by ties\nof neighbourliness, common history and future, will\nbuild strong, stable and neutral relations to meet the\naspirations of both peoples. As they build with mutual\nrespect, confidence and common strategic interests,\nthese relations will take into account the need for\npreserving stability and peace in our region,\nparticularly at this specific juncture when the\ninternational community is confronting formidable\nsecurity challenges.\nIn spite of continued appeals made by the\ninternational community to bring about peace in the\nMiddle East, the Palestinian people still suffer on a\ndaily basis from the mad violence inflicted on them by\nthe Israeli occupation forces and practices that flout the\nmost elementary principles of international\nhumanitarian law. Notwithstanding successive Security\nCouncil resolutions, Israel still persists in its repressive\npolicy, paying no heed to any international covenant\n12\n\nand denying the very agreements into which it has\nentered.\nIn contrast, leaders of the Arab States have\ndemonstrated a keen sense of responsibility and a\ncontinued pledge to embrace peace, culminating at the\nArab summit in Beirut in March 2002 with the\nadoption of the Arab peace initiative presented by His\nRoyal Highness Crown Prince Abdullah ibn Abdul-\nAziz of the sister Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. On the\nother hand, Morocco welcomes the vision advocated by\nUnited States President George W. Bush, in which he\ncalled for the establishment of a Palestinian State to\ncoexist side by side with Israel, as a lasting and viable\nsolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, one likely to\nachieve peace and security for all peoples of the region\nand to put a definite end to violence and instability.\nHowever, recent events and developments in the region\ndo not, unfortunately, give substance to this vision. The\nspiral of violence has instead witnessed an\nunprecedented escalation.\nFor decades, the Kingdom of Morocco has been\nendeavouring to act as a bridge between the peoples of\nthe region, with a view to achieving a climate of peace\nand security and contributing to the revitalization of\nthe peace process, the creation of an independent\nPalestinian State with Al-Quds al-Sharif as its capital\nand the recovery by Syria and Lebanon of their\nterritories occupied since 1967.\nIn view of the importance of Al-Quds al-Sharif as\na key point in the peace process, and seeking to\npreserve the national and religious identity of this Holy\nCity in accordance with the relevant Security Council\nresolutions, His Majesty King Mohammed VI,\nChairman of the Al-Quds Committee, is continuing his\nefforts, along with brother Kings, Emirs and Presidents\nof the Muslim member States of the Committee, with\nthe United States of America and the Russian\nFederation in their capacity as peace patrons, and with\nthe presidency of the European Union, with His\nHoliness the Pope and with the United Nations\nSecretary-General, in order to safeguard the Islamic\nArab character of Al-Quds al-Sharif and to preserve it\nas a place of coexistence and tolerance among the three\nrevealed religions.\nThe Iraqi issue has become a major preoccupation\nfor the entire world, owing to the suffering of the Iraqi\npeople. For this reason, while we demand that Iraq\nimplement the relevant United Nations resolutions, we\nalso call for deep reflection and patience in dealing\nwith the Iraqi question, hoping that the Iraqi\nGovernment will respond to the international\ncommunity's request. The aim would be to avoid the\ninfliction of further suffering, distress and misery on\nthe Iraqi people. At any rate, the United Nations is\nrequired to act within the framework of its Charter's\nprinciples and purposes in order to preserve the\nstability and security of all countries in the region. In\nthis context, Morocco expresses its concern with regard\nto the Kuwaiti prisoners of war and missing persons,\nand the need to preserve the unity and independence of\nthe State of Kuwait. Morocco also emphasizes the need\nto preserve Iraq's unity and sovereignty over all its\nterritory.\nThe same region is witnessing another conflict\ninvolving two sister States that have strong bonds of\nfriendship and cooperation with Morocco \u2014 that is, the\nUnited Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran.\nMy country is hopeful that our brothers in Iran will\nbecome convinced of the need to settle the conflict\nover the islands of Abu Musa, the Greater Tunb and the\nLesser Tunb, by peaceful means, in accordance with\nthe principles of the United Nations Charter and the\nrules of international law. This will affect positively\ntheir bilateral relations, as well as the stability and\ncooperation in the region.\nIn conclusion, under the leadership of His\nMajesty King Mohammed VI, the Kingdom of\nMorocco, as a member of the African, Arab, and\nMuslim family and given its position in the Euro-\nMediterranean region, has always held dear the basic\nvalues of tolerance, moderation, open-mindedness and\ndialogue in dealing with the international community.\nMorocco will always honour its obligations towards the\ninternational community to strengthen the foundations\nof security and stability and to give impetus to the new\nvisions charted for the world of the twenty-first\ncentury. We will always remain ready to contribute\nwithin the United Nations to finding the most efficient\nmeans of improving conditions in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffProud as we are\nthat our small island nation of Tuvalu is a member of\nthis great family of nations, first we must give thanks\nto God Almighty for his love and for allowing us all to\nparticipate in this general debate. Let me also extend\nmy delegation's sincere appreciation to the\nGovernment of our host country, the United States of\nAmerica, for its warm hospitality and support.\nTuvalu warmly congratulates you, Sir, on your\nelection to the high office and commends highly the\noutgoing President for his leadership, especially during\na very challenging year for the Organization. Tuvalu\nalso wishes to reaffirm its strong confidence in the\nSecretary-General. In addition, we warmly congratulate\nSwitzerland on its entry into the United Nations, and\nwe welcome membership of East Timor later on in this\nsession.\nTuvalu sincerely joins, both in spirit and hearts,\nin the remembrance of the great loss, particularly of\ninnocent human lives, following the terrorist attacks on\nAmerican soil last year. We pray for the victims'\nfamilies and for full recovery in restoring their lives.\nWithin our own Organization, we are proud that of this\nturmoil the United Nations has come out ever stronger\nwith the resolve to combat international terrorism.\nIn Tuvalu and many island countries in the\nPacific, we know our own unique vulnerability is also\nfertile ground to forces of terror that threaten the\nsecurity and survival of the islands. It is in this regard\nthat Tuvalu is committed to the Pacific Islands Forum\nDeclarations on regional security, highlighted in the\nForum Communiqu\u00e9, which is circulated as a United\nNations paper. In the same spirit, last year Tuvalu\npledged its commitment to the United Nations anti-\nterrorism resolutions, and we still do. But we also need\nboth technical and financial assistance from the\ninternational community to enable us to fulfil our\ninternational obligations.\nJoining and being part of the United Nations is\nnever easy, particularly for a small and poorly\nresourced island country such as Tuvalu. Asserting our\nplace here competes with the many other priorities of\nnation-building. However, our presence here is proof of\nour belief all along since our independence that,\nthrough the United Nations principle of equal\nparticipation, our voice on our security and\ndevelopment concerns will be advocated and better\nheard.\n2\n\nAlthough new, Tuvalu supports the reforms being\nundertaken in the Organization to streamline and\nensure efficiency. In particular, it supports initiatives\nthat have been developed on reforms in the Security\nCouncil and in the work of the Secretariat, and it is our\nstrong view that they warrant proper support. It is also\nour view that equitable representation more reflective\nof the diversity in the United Nations membership,\nboth in the staffing of United Nations Secretariat and in\nits various working committees, needs to be properly\nconsidered.\nAs a peace-loving nation, Tuvalu believes that the\nparamount mission of the United Nations must remain\nthe maintenance of peace and security for all nations of\nthe world, as clearly articulated in the preamble to the\nUnited Nations Charter. However, a long outstanding\nissue that also warrants serious consideration is the\nquestion of the Republic of China on Taiwan. This\ncountry has a population of 23 million people, a well-\ndefined territory and an established democratic system\nof Government, and is a responsible international actor\nin world trade and relations. It is, therefore, our strong\nopinion that the right to self-determination of the\npeople of the Republic of China and to join the United\nNations should be urgently addressed. The United\nNations cannot be said to be universal, nor can global\npeace be assured, until the Republic of China issue is\nproperly resolved.\nAs we progress in the new century, however, we\nare increasingly challenged by the many changes that\nare taking place. Never before has the human race\nfaced such complex challenges. We are in a world\nwhere the concept of globalization is in the media\nevery day. Yet while we share a world where trade,\ncommunications and travel appear to have made us a\nsingle global community, large parts of the world\ncontinue to suffer from poverty, marginalization and\nenvironmental decline. We are far from being a\ncohesive global community. Unfortunately, Tuvalu and\nmany small island developing States are in a\nparticularly weak position to participate fully and take\nadvantage of the opportunities of globalization. There\nis a genuine need for special assistance to enhance our\ncapacity in this regard.\nOn the issue of conflict prevention, Tuvalu, like\nother vulnerable small island nations, is particularly\nweary of conflicts and wars. It is our humble view that,\nall too often, countries seem compelled to resort to\nmilitary and violent action in order to resolve conflicts\nrather than seek to understand the root causes of these\nconflicts. We strongly feel this approach needs careful\nreconsideration. The build-up of arms and massive\nexpenditure on so-called defence completely\novershadow all efforts to resolve the underlying causes\nof poverty, unrest and instability. For us to survive as\nan international community we must reverse this trend.\nWe must also learn to listen to each other.\nIn this respect, Tuvalu firmly believes that we\nmust place greater faith in the United Nations as the\nforum for meaningfully addressing poverty, conflicts\nand instability and the effects of environmental\ndegradation. It is here, in the common house of the\nhuman family, where countries should come, put down\ntheir arms, listen to each other and resolve their\ndifferences together. We believe that this is the only\nway forward to ensuring long-lasting world peace,\nsecurity and sustainable development.\nTuvalu agrees with the importance of sustainable\ndevelopment and subscribes to the goals espoused in\nthe Millennium Declaration, particularly those on\npoverty eradication. It also welcomes the holding of\nthe United Nations international conferences,\nincluding, those on the rights of the child, financing for\ndevelopment and the review of the implementation of\nAgenda 21 through the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment. In addition, Tuvalu also appreciates\ncommitments made recently to replenish the Global\nEnvironment Facility (GEF), so vitally important to\nmany countries, especially to Small Island Developing\nStates.\nHowever, while Tuvalu appreciates the\nconsiderations for small island developing States in the\nvarious processes, we appeal for more concrete\nrecognition, particularly by the donor community, of\nour special case so that we can cope with the\nchallenges that we face, particularly with regards to\ncapacity-building through quality education and health,\naccess to fresh water and affordable energy,\ninfrastructures and sanitation. Without additional and\nadequate resources, partnership initiatives arising from\nthose processes will have no real meaning, especially\nfor those groups that are most in need, such as women,\nchildren and people in rural and outer island areas.\nIt need not be repeated, but for Tuvalu,\ndevelopment aid is indispensable to development. For\nus, official development assistance (ODA) is the\ndevelopment budget. The maintenance of vital services\n3\n\nto our people through innovative partnerships, such as\nthe Tuvalu Trust Fund, for example, would not have\nbeen possible without ODA. I would like at this\njuncture to acknowledge with great sincerity Tuvalu's\nappreciation of all its development partners,\nparticularly our traditional donors, old and new, such as\nAustralia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Japan,\nthe European Union and the Republic of China on\nTaiwan.\nFor our part, having progressed as a sovereign\nnation with relative peace and stability over the past\ntwenty-four years, Tuvalu is strongly committed to the\nUnited Nations principle of good governance. The\nrecently elected Government of Tuvalu is fully\ncommitted to the principles of good governance,\ndemocracy and respect for the rule of law. It is also\ncommitted to accountability and transparency, in\nharmony with Christian values and traditional and\ncultural norms. As in the past, we are also committed\nto the prudent management of finances and to further\nwork on reforms to improve our systems.\nTuvalu is surrounded by the huge Pacific Ocean\nand is well aware, both of its rights to its vast marine\nresources and also of its responsibility to ensure the\nproper and sustainable management of the potentials of\nthe ocean. We therefore fully associate ourselves with\nthe Pacific Islands Forum's Regional Ocean Policy\nrecently adopted by our leaders.\nFinally, peace, security and long-term livelihood\nfor the world will have no meaning to us in Tuvalu in\nthe absence of serious actions to address the adverse\nand devastating effects of global warming. At no more\nthan three meters above sea level, Tuvalu is\nparticularly exposed to those effects. Indeed our people\nare already migrating to escape. We are already\nsuffering from the consequences of what world\nauthorities on climate change have consistently been\nwarning us. Only two weeks ago, a period when the\nweather was normal and calm and the tide was low,\nunusually big waves suddenly crashed ashore and\nflooded most parts of the capital island.\nIn the event that the situation is not reversed,\nwhere does the international community think the\nTuvalu people can hide from the onslaught of sea-level\nrise? Taking us in as environmental refugees is not\nwhat Tuvalu is after in the long run. We want the\nislands of Tuvalu and our nation to remain permanently\nand not to be submerged as a result of the greed and\nuncontrolled consumption of industrialized countries.\nWe want our children to grow up the way we grew up\nin our own islands and in our own culture.\nWe once again appeal to the industrialized\ncountries, particularly those who have not done so, to\nurgently ratify and to fully implement the Kyoto\nProtocol and to provide concrete support in all our\nadaptation efforts to cope with the effects of climate\nchange and sea-level rise. Tuvalu, having little or\nnothing to do with the causes, cannot be left on its own\nto pay the price. We must all work together. May God\nbless you all, and God bless the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me first to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election to the high\noffice of the presidency of the current session and to\nexpress confidence that, under your able leadership, the\nfifty-seventh session of the General Assembly will be\nsuccessful and fruitful.\nThe terrorist acts in the United States, the\nanniversary of which we have just marked with great\nsorrow, prompted all mankind to pay close attention to\nthe fundamental issues of sustainable development.\nThe barbaric acts of international terrorists\ndemonstrated very convincingly the fragility of the\nworld we live in and the importance for all States to\njoin their efforts to ensure economic development and\ncivil rights, security and stability.\nThe contemporary world, with all the diversity of\nits political and economic systems, requires, as never\nbefore, agreed and coordinated efforts by the\ncommunity of nations to protect common human\nvalues, primarily the rights of all citizens to a decent\nlife.\nHas mankind been able to rid itself of its own\nentrenched flaws \u2014 poverty, environmental pollution,\ndisease and crime? The answer is more than evident:\nthe community of nations has not made progress in\nresolving those issues. Thus, breeding grounds have\nbeen created for the spread of such dangerous\nphenomena as terrorism and drug trafficking, religious\nextremism and the illegal arms trade. Having crossed\nthe threshold of the new millennium, mankind has been\nforced to exert efforts to resolve centuries-old issues\nand to counter new threats.\nThe events that took place last year have changed\nthe world and have prompted everybody to think hard\nabout the foundations that support it. The community\nof nations faces a pressing task: to create a new\narchitecture of global security based on a multi-polar\nworld, and to set up effective mechanisms to overcome\nthe obstacles to modern economic and political\ndevelopment.\nIn our view, under these circumstances, the role\nand the responsibility of international institutions,\nprimarily the United Nations, become significantly\ngreater. Strengthening the authority of the United\nNations is our common responsibility. We believe that\nthe existing system of adopting decisions affecting the\nfundamental interests of mankind should never be\ndoubted, let alone reshaped in any way. The issues of\nthe world and peace should be considered and\ndecisions reflecting the will and the interests of the\ncommunity of nations should be adopted only within\nthe framework of the United Nations.\nGrounds for the use of force against Member\nStates should be irrefutable evidence, corroborated by\ninternational institutions, of their illegal action to\ndisrupt the world order and to undermine global and\nregional security.\nThe changed world forces us to take a fresh look\nat disarmament issues, primarily the consolidation of\nthe non-proliferation regime. It is becoming more and\nmore evident that, under these new conditions, the\ncommunity of nations should focus its main efforts on\npreventing terrorists from getting hold of weapons of\nmass destruction. Therefore, joint action by Member\nStates to continue to consolidate the non-proliferation\nregime and to make it universal deserve special\nattention. We believe that the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which binds\nits participants to take nuclear disarmament measures,\n9\n\nshould continue to play an important role in the area of\nnuclear arms control.\nAs one of the few States in the world that have\nvoluntarily relinquished their nuclear heritage, we\nbelieve that a prerequisite for an atmosphere of trust in\ncontemporary international relations is the early entry\ninto force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban\nTreaty (CTBT).\nBecause it attaches great significance to the\npreservation of peace and security in Central Asia,\nKazakhstan is interested in signing, as soon as\npossible, a treaty creating a nuclear-weapon-free zone\nin the region. Such a zone could be an important\ncontribution by regional States to the disarmament and\narms control efforts of international community.\nFurther, additional results-oriented efforts to\nprevent the excessive accumulation of and illegal\ntrafficking in small arms are no less important. It is\nimpossible to ignore the alarming fact that 55 per cent\nof known small arms stocks, equivalent to 305 million\npieces, are now already in private hands. In view of the\nneed for targeted actions in this area, we express our\nwillingness to host in Kazakhstan, in 2003, an\ninternational conference on this subject under the\nauspices of the United Nations.\nOur country, home to the Baikonur space\nlaunching pad, is well aware of the harmful effects of\nthe militarization of outer space. Therefore, we believe\nthat it is imperative to start, without delay, talks to\nprevent an arms race in outer space.\nFrom the very start, Kazakhstan has resolutely\nand unconditionally supported counter-terrorist actions\nby the international coalition. Without any doubt, its\neffective measures have contributed to the settlement\nof the situation in Afghanistan.\nTogether with all interested States and parties,\nour country supports the key role of the United Nations\nin the post-conflict peace-building in Afghanistan. We\nintend to take a most active part in implementing an\ninternational aid programme for Afghanistan.\nKazakhstan is cooperating successfully with the World\nFood Programme by using it to send its agricultural\nproducts to Afghanistan. Our country has provided the\nAfghan people with free humanitarian aid in the form\nof grain. We believe that early implementation of the\ndecisions adopted at the Tokyo Conference will\ncontribute to the successful solution of the Afghan\nproblem and to the eradication of international\nterrorism.\nWhen we speak about Afghanistan, we cannot\nignore the issue of drug trafficking. Unfortunately, that\nlong-suffering country continues to be a main source of\nthe proliferation of drugs that are being transported\nthrough the territories of the Central Asian States and\nsold on the world markets, first of all in Europe. This\nproblem is getting more and more dangerous and\nrequires urgent and effective measures by the\ncommunity of nations. We hope that the coordinating\nrole of the United Nations International Drug Control\nProgramme will be strengthened. One has to realize\nthat it is the drug trafficking that constitutes a financial\nbasis of international terrorism. When we put up a just\nfight against that evil, we, unfortunately, fight its\nmanifestations and do not pay due attention to the root\ncause of the phenomenon. If this state of affairs\nremains unchanged, curbing international terrorism\nwill turn into an indefinite process that will exhaust all\nfinancial and political resources of the community of\nnations.\nThe world community is closely watching the\ndevelopment of the situation in the Middle East.\nInterested States quite justifiably express their concern\nover the deteriorating chances of a peaceful settlement.\nWe support the need to convene as soon as possible an\ninternational conference on the Middle East settlement\nin order to take parallel steps: to strengthen Israel's\nsecurity, to strengthen Palestinian economic and\npolitical institutions and to settle the details of the final\npeace agreement. The international community also has\nto intensify its efforts to curb terrorism and meet the\nhumanitarian needs of the Palestinian people.\nSince the first days of its independence,\nKazakhstan has focussed its foreign affairs efforts on\nthe creation of a security system in Asia. That goal was\nadvanced by the first summit meeting of the\nConference on Interaction and Confidence-Building\nMeasures in Asia (CICA), convened in June of this\nyear in Almaty. For the first time ever, the heads of the\nmajor Asian States came together to express their\npolitical will and interest in a joint search for ways to\nstrengthen peace and stability in the Asian region.\nThe adoption at the summit meeting of the final\ndocuments, the Almaty Act on the institutionalization\nof the CICA and the Declaration on Eliminating\nTerrorism and Promoting Dialogue among\n10\n\nCivilizations, has had an extraordinary significance.\nFor the first time ever, the Asian continent has adopted\ndocuments making a significant contribution to\nregional and global security. Expressing our\nappreciation to the CICA member States for their\nefficient work at the summit meeting, we call on all\ninterested States to continue their work to implement\nconfidence-building measures in Asia.\nWe in Kazakhstan believe that the Shanghai\nCooperation Organization can become an effective tool\nin ensuring security and stability in the region. The\nmain mission of that organization is to address jointly\nthe problems of security, as well as to create effective\nmechanisms for trade, economic and humanitarian\ncooperation.\nThe Johannesburg Summit fully highlighted the\nimportant need to overcome the antagonisms of modern\neconomic and political development. It has become\nevident that with increasing globalization, the\ncommunity of nations will have to pay close attention\nto the search for ways to ensure a more harmonious\ndivision of profits and benefits between the rich and\npoor among mankind. Addressing the forum in South\nAfrica, the President of Kazakhstan, Mr. Nursultan\nNazarbaev, rightly observed that without the natural\nand human resources of the developing countries the\nrich States would have never become rich.\nIt is commonly recognized that sustainable\ndevelopment is the only way to ensure the survival of\nmankind. Therefore, Kazakhstan supports targeted and\ncoordinated efforts by the international community to\nsolve burning economic, social and environmental\nproblems of the Central Asian region. We attach great\nsignificance to cooperation with the United Nations in\nwater resources management, rehabilitation of the\nenvironmental disaster areas in the Semipalatinsk\nregion and the Aral Sea, the preservation of\nbiodiversity and the prevention of soil degradation and\ndesertification. At the same time, Kazakhstan has every\nright to expect more effective actions in this field on\nthe part of the United Nations. Unfortunately, our\ncountry, as well as other regional States, have yet to\nreceive assistance that would speed up the solution of\nthe environmental problems.\nKazakhstan is interested in strengthening fruitful\ncooperation with the United Nations to improve\nregional transportation infrastructure, including within\nthe United Nations Special Programme for the\nEconomies of Central Asia (SPECA).\nKazakhstan is actively cooperating with its\nEurasian Economic Community partners and considers\nthat integration organization to be a very promising\nstructure in terms of creating a common economic\nspace for an extensive stretch of the Eurasian\ncontinent.\nOur country stands for a more effective Economic\nCooperation Organization (ECO) and for making its\nactivities more goal-oriented. We express our hope that\nthe upcoming Istanbul summit will become a milestone\nin ECO's activities.\nThe diplomatic efforts of Kazakhstan are also\naimed at further strengthening political cooperation,\ntrade and economic ties with the Central Asian States.\nWe believe that a recently created new organization,\nthe Central Asian Union, has an important role to play\nin this regard.\nThe legal status of the Caspian Sea is becoming\nan increasingly important problem within the context\nof current international relations. The lack of consensus\namong the five Caspian States on the legal status of\nthis unique water basin seriously hampers the chances\nof turning the Caspian Sea into a zone of peace and\ngenuine cooperation. The issues of unrestricted\nnavigation, the protection of biodiversity and the\nenvironment, as well as demilitarization, remain very\nmuch on the agenda. Kazakhstan has consistently\ncalled for the continuation of the preparatory work for\na multilateral convention based on the consensus\namong the five Caspian States in order to develop\nsecure legal safeguards providing for long-term and\nstable cooperation and for creating favourable\nconditions for attracting investments to develop the\nmineral resources of the Caspian Sea.\nIn this regard, Kazakhstan attaches great\nsignificance to an agreement with Russia on the\ndelimitation of the seabed in the northern part of the\nCaspian Sea in order to ensure the rights of the users of\nthe seabed subsoil, as well as to the protocol on the\nmodified median line in this part of the sea signed in\nJune of this year.\nWe believe that the signing of these documents\nrepresents a breakthrough in the protracted process of\nthe development of the legal status of the Caspian Sea.\nThese important agreements give the green light to\n\n\nforeign investments in the development of the\nenormous mineral resources of Kazakhstan's sector of\nthe sea. This will allow our country to join the group of\nleading world producers of hydrocarbons. We intend to\ncontinue our cooperation with international financial\ninstitutions and companies, thereby ensuring a\nfavourable investment climate in Kazakhstan.\nKazakhstan has assumed obligations with regard\nto the observation and protection of fundamental\nhuman rights and freedoms. Our country is a\nparticipant in major international human rights\nconventions and exerts every effort to implement them.\nDemocracy and human rights are part and parcel\nof political life in Kazakhstan, which has undertaken,\nin complex geopolitical conditions, reforms aimed at\nthe liberalization of the economy and at the creation of\na civil society. These reforms are unprecedented for a\npost-Soviet State.\nThe question of human rights, in the view of our\ncountry, should be on the agenda of inter-State\ncooperation. At the same time, we believe that unified\nstandards and criteria should be used in assessing the\nhuman rights situation in a particular country. We\nbelieve that the prerogative and responsibility for the\nconsideration of the state of affairs in this very\nsensitive area should rest with the United Nations. We\nare pinning great hopes on the activities of the United\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nIn an increasingly interdependent world, there is\nno alternative to multilateral cooperation. Only jointly\ncan we work successfully for a world without wars and\nconflicts, a world based on justice and prosperity.\nWe have embraced with great enthusiasm the\nstatement made by the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, and express our support for his concept of\njoining efforts in order to address the key issues of\nmodern times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI have the honour to deliver the statement of the\nGovernment of Saudi Arabia on behalf of His Royal\nHighness the Minister for Foreign Affairs.\nIt gives me great pleasure at the outset of the\nfifty-seventh session of the General Assembly to\nconvey to Mr. Kavan personally and to his friendly\ncountry, the Czech Republic, our sincerest\ncongratulations on his election to the important\nposition of President of the Assembly. We are\nconfident that he will preside with great skill and\nefficiency over our deliberations.\nI wish to take this opportunity to express our\ngratitude to his predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, who\npresided over the last session with wisdom and\nexperience and deserves our gratitude and appreciation.\nI also wish to take this opportunity to express our\nthanks and appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan for his tireless efforts to achieve peace and\nconsolidate security throughout the world and for his\npersistent efforts to strengthen the Organization's role\nand enhance its efficiency.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia believes that the\nrecent admission of Switzerland to membership of this\nOrganization will enrich the United Nations and\nundoubtedly enhance its role, given that country's\nremarkable contributions to and experience in\ninternational cooperation.\nOur current session coincides with the first\nanniversary of the horrendous disaster that befell the\nUnited States of America as a result of a most\ndespicable act of terrorism that led to the death of\nthousands of innocent lives, with enormous material\nlosses and immeasurable harm from which we are all\nstill suffering. The pain and suffering of the American\npeople over the loss of their relatives and loved ones as\na result of this cowardly act was our loss, too, as we\nwitnessed those events in a state of total shock and\ndismay. We felt nothing but absolute condemnation for\nthose who committed that utterly criminal and barbaric\nact.\nI therefore convey our sincerest condolences and\nheartfelt sympathies to the President of the United\nStates, to the families of the victims and to the\nAmerican people. I assure them that this horrible\nexperience can only strengthen what we already know\nabout the inner strength and pride of the American\npeople. Those feelings of fortitude and resolve, as well\nas their determination to confront this challenge and to\nmove on with resolve, guided by the principles and\nvalues of the founding fathers of their great nation,\nwere unmistakable when we, along with the American\n23\n\npeople and President, commemorated the first\nanniversary of the tragedy.\nIt was most overwhelmingly painful for us to see\na number of our young people, who were in a position\nto contribute beneficially to the development and well-\nbeing of their own country, fall victim to those who led\nthem astray as they embarked on a road that ended\ntragically. Those young men committed a grave offense\nagainst their country and their religion, which totally\nand utterly forbids the crime they committed.\nMay I be permitted here to quote from the letter\nsent to United States President George W. Bush by His\nRoyal Highness Crown Prince Abdullah, in describing\nthose young men in a most unambiguous and\nmeaningful manner:\n\u201cWe in Saudi Arabia felt especially acute pain at\nthe realization that a number of young Saudi\ncitizens had been enticed and deluded and their\nreasoning subverted to the degree of denying the\ntolerance that their religion embraced and turning\ntheir backs on their homeland, which has always\nstood for understanding and moderation. They\nallowed themselves to be used as a tool to do\ngreat damage to Islam, a religion they espoused,\nand to all Muslims.\n\u201cI would like to make it very clear that real\nMuslims throughout the world will never allow a\nminority of defiant extremists to speak in the\nname of Islam and distort its spirit of tolerance.\n\u201cYour friends in the Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia denounced and condemned the attacks of\n11 September as strongly as the American people\ndid. Like them, we are convinced that nothing can\never justify the shedding of innocent blood or the\ntaking of lives and the terrorizing of people,\nregardless of cause or motive. Therefore, we do\nnot simply reiterate our sincere condolences to\nthe victims' relatives; we also assure all of our\ncontinued will and determination to do all we can\nto combat that malignant evil and uproot it from\nour world. My country will maintain its firm\nresolve to combat terrorism unilaterally and\njointly with the international coalition. We shall\npursue the war against terrorism relentlessly. Our\ndrive emanates from our firm conviction that\nterrorism is a pernicious disease that poses a\nlethal threat to every human society and every\neffort must be made to confront and defeat it.\u201d\nSaudi Arabia's position regarding terrorism has\nalways been very clear, dispassionate and responsible.\nThat is logical since our country was honoured by God\nto be the custodian of the Muslims' holiest sites, and it\nis also the birthplace of the heavenly message of Islam.\nThus, we want to uphold the principles and teachings\nof the Islamic faith.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reaffirms its total\nsupport for all Security Council resolutions related to\nthe question of terrorism. It has been cooperating fully\nwith the international community in implementing\nthose resolutions, with the aim of combating terrorism.\nMoreover, Saudi Arabia has taken the necessary steps\nto close any gaps in regulations related to charitable\nfundraising that might be exploited for illegal\npurposes.\nThe competent authorities in Saudi Arabia have\nput in place all the necessary measures to implement\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001). Moreover, the\nGovernment of Saudi Arabia has lent its support to\nevery international effort, within the framework of the\nSecurity Council, to crack down on terrorism by all\nmeans approved by the international community.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which has itself\nsuffered from terrorist acts, has enacted regulations that\nmete out punishment to the perpetrators of terrorist\nacts. Moreover, it has made the fight against terrorism\npart of its basic school curricula.\nAt the regional level, Saudi Arabia was one of the\nfirst countries to sign the Pan-Arab Convention for the\nSuppression of Terrorism, adopted by the League of\nArab States in 1998, and it is also a signatory to the\nConvention of the Organization of the Islamic\nConference on Combating International Terrorism.\nAt the international level, Saudi Arabia is a party\nto 10 conventions and agreements that deal with\nvarious forms of terrorism. We sincerely look to the\nUnited Nations, which represents all countries of the\nworld, to make the international effort to combat\nterrorism a truly global one, without bias or\ndiscrimination, with the primary goal of serving all\nmembers of the international community and protecting\nthem from the evils of terrorism, including State-\nsupported terrorism.\nConfronting terrorism, international cooperation\nin tracking down terrorist organizations and the\nexploration of all ways and means to eradicate it\n24\n\nrepresent important steps towards eliminating that\ndangerous phenomenon. However, the international\neffort against terrorism, regardless of its effectiveness,\nwill not be capable of totally eradicating that\nphenomenon unless it addresses its underlying causes,\nincluding political, economic and social circumstances\nthat become ground for extremism, violence and\nterrorism.\nThe decision to eradicate terrorism has been\ntaken, without hesitation or vacillation. However, if our\ntrue objective is to eradicate the possibility of its\nrecurrence, then attention must be paid to the political,\neconomic and social conditions that, in many instances,\ncreate grounds for extremism, especially when those\nconditions reach serious proportions and the possibility\nfor peaceful change and development does not exist.\nFor example, the deteriorating conditions of\noppressed people, whether they suffer injustice and\noppression or are subject to foreign occupation, and the\ninternational community's inability, for one reason or\nanother, to find just solutions to those problems will\nultimately lead to a situation in which opportunity is\ncreated for people with evil intentions to take\nadvantage of na\u00efve young men who are led to believe\nthat violence and terrorism are the only and ideal\nmeans for correcting the injustice that afflict them.\nThirty-five years have passed since the\nPalestinian people came under the suffocating Israeli\noccupation. The cycle of violence in the occupied\nPalestinian territories will never end unless the\nlegitimate rights of the Palestinians are respected.\nThose rights have been acknowledged by the\ninternational community as a whole and are enshrined\nin many United Nations resolutions and have become\nlegally binding through various international\nagreements signed by consecutive Israeli Governments\nwith the Palestinian side.\nThe obligations contained in those agreements\nhave been completely ignored by the Israelis, whether\nthey relate to the continuation of the occupation or the\ntreatment of the Palestinian people and their legitimate\nleadership.\nThe policy of siege, starvation, military\nincursions, the destruction of property and the\ndesecration of holy places totally contravenes not only\nsigned agreements, but also international law and\nhumanitarian norms.\nFurthermore, the Government of Ariel Sharon is\nmarginalizing the Palestinian Authority, established\nunder the Oslo Accords, isolating the Palestinian\nterritories and destroying their infrastructure. In\naddition, with nothing left to destroy, recently Sharon\nhas implemented a policy not only of imprisoning, but\nalso of assassinating, members of the Palestinian\nleadership. He recently and blatantly declared that\nIsrael is no longer bound by any agreement signed with\nthe Palestinians, including the Oslo Accords.\nThe situation in the occupied Palestinian\nterritories will undoubtedly lead to a humanitarian\ndisaster resulting from the economic siege, the\nunchecked spread of disease and the virtual collapse of\npublic health and security forces.\nThe most important fact to be recalled by all,\nparticularly the Israeli people, is that the goal of\nsecurity promised by the current Israeli Government\nwill never materialize. That is due directly to the\npolicies and practices of that Government, which chose\nto ignore dialogue and negotiations and opted for\noppression and violence as a means of resolving the\nPalestinian problem.\nPresident Bush's statement to the Assembly\nconcerning the difficulty of attaining peace between the\nPalestinians and Israelis, without providing the\nfreedom necessary for both, conforms with the current\nsituation in the occupied territories, which continue to\nface a cycle of violence and suffering because one side,\nnamely the Palestinians, has been denied its right to\nfreedom and independence.\nTherefore, the exit point of that dilemma is\nIsrael's acknowledgement of the importance of the\nexistence of a Palestinian State established on a basis\nof constitutional legality and capable of conducting\nnegotiations and resolving pending problems that\ncannot be ignored or bypassed. That is the action that\nmust be taken if we truly intend to put an end to the\ncrisis in the occupied territories, the price of which is\nbeing paid by both Palestinians and Israelis.\nWe believe that an independent Palestinian State,\nbased on a constitution binding on all Palestinians, and\nspecifying the basis and rules governing their relations\nwith Israel, will ultimately constitute a guarantee not\nonly for the Palestinians, but also for the Israelis\nthemselves, because the Israeli side will have the\nassurance of dealing with a legitimate entity with clear\ncharacteristics, structures and institutions. Their future\n25\n\nrelations will determine their responsibilities. To\nachieve this goal, the international community must\nmove to end the humanitarian catastrophe and suffering\nfaced by the Palestinian people.\nThere is also a dire need to halt the violence\nraging in the area through a practical and dispassionate\ntreatment of the security situation. That clearly means\nthat the international community must hold the Israeli\nGovernment accountable to the same level of security\nobligations that is required of the Palestinian Authority.\nTo limit the security obligations to the Palestinian side\nalone is neither practical nor a means of solving the\nproblem. It is incumbent on all of us to work together\nto alleviate the suffering of the Palestinians and to take\nthe necessary practical steps to put the Palestinian\nproblem on the path to the desired settlement.\nAs far as the comprehensive settlement of the\nArab-Israeli conflict is concerned, we see in the Arab\npeace initiative adopted at the Beirut Arab Summit a\nhistoric move that contains all the requirements for a\njust and permanent peace in the Middle East based on\nresolutions of international legitimacy and supported\nby all Arab States. It would lead to Israel's full\nwithdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and to\nnormalization of Arab relations with Israel.\nThere is another problem that has reached crisis\nproportions and has become a source of grave danger\nto the security and stability of the Middle East: the\nissue of Iraq and its implementation of the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions. President Bush\nmentioned in his speech before the General Assembly\nthe need to refer this matter to the Security Council in\norder to have the appropriate resolutions adopted. That\nrepresents a new and positive approach that we view\nwith satisfaction. Without a doubt, that step has led to a\nnew climate, resulting in the decision of the Iraqi\nGovernment to allow the unconditional return of\nUnited Nations weapons inspectors. That development,\nwhich will avert confrontation through diplomatic\nmeans, shows that a positive step will, in most cases,\nlead to a reciprocal positive step. At this point, it is\nappropriate to express our satisfaction with the Iraqi\nGovernment's prompt response to the call of the\nministerial committee of the League of Arab States,\nwhich met in parallel with the General Assembly. We\nbelieve that it is now the Security Council's\nresponsibility to undertake serious efforts to alleviate\nthe suffering of the brotherly people of Iraq. We also\nbelieve that it is now the responsibility of Iraq to\npromptly carry out its pledges to allow the return of the\nUnited Nations weapon inspection teams without prior\nconditions.\nThe world has suffered great destruction and\nhuman misery during the last century, which was\ncharacterized by bloody confrontations, hate, conflicts\nand violence. In a world of intertwined dependencies\nand common interests, the peace and stability of\nhumankind depend largely upon the international\ncommunity's determination to forsake wars, renounce\nviolence, combat terrorism and settle disputes by\npeaceful means and through the promotion of a culture\nof peace and dialogue, as well as by consolidating\ninternational cooperation, tolerance and understanding.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia calls for the\nestablishment of an international humanitarian order\nbased on a new form of partnership between the\ndeveloped and developing countries, on a solid basis of\ncooperation, solidarity and international economic\nrelations built on justice, equality, mutual benefits and\njoint responsibilities.\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia looks forward to a\ntwenty-first century governed by the rule of law and\nnot by brutal force, a century of true pluralism in which\neveryone will participate in managing the affairs of the\npresent and in creating the future, instead of excluding\nand ignoring others. We look forward to a year in\nwhich the moral values that govern human behaviour\nwill prevail and in which the banners of justice, mercy\nand interaction among peoples will be raised in order\nto achieve security, stability and peace for all humanity.\n\n\n\n\n"

The best way we can\nhonour their memory is by taking up and acting upon\nall the many-faceted challenges that terrorism and\nother threats pose to human security. The world has\nchanged irrevocably, although we cannot as yet say\nexactly how.

Even where\nthe use of military force is clearly necessary and\njustified, as it was against Al Qaeda and the Taliban, it\nis never an adequate answer. In Afghanistan we are\nnow faced with the need to use a full range of civilian\ncrisis management capabilities, as well as with the\nneed for a long-term commitment to reconstruction and\nthe development of a stable and drug-free economy,\nand to enable democracy and respect for human rights\nto take root in a country that has suffered from war and\nstrife for decades. And Afghanistan is only one of\nmany places in today's world where such a\ncommitment from the international community is\nneeded.\nWe must also come to grips with conditions in\nwhich some people can regard even terrorism as\njustified. To say that does not imply any understanding\nfor indiscriminate terrorism. Terrorism is a crime\nwhose perpetrators must be brought to justice\nirrespective of their motives.\nIt is vitally important to underline the need to\nstrengthen the rule of law. When terrorists attack\ndemocracy, humanity and justice, we should not and\ncannot fight it with means that are in conflict with\nthose basic values that the terrorists are attacking. It is\ntime to review frankly the measures taken after 11\n25\n\nSeptember and to rectify any excesses that are not\nacceptable in societies based on freedom and justice.\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) has been\nin gestation for many years, and its creation can be\nregarded as one of the major achievements of the\nUnited Nations. It was not created primarily to deal\nwith terrorism, but the importance of the ICC has\nobviously grown, not diminished, since 11 September.\nThe ICC is a long-standing goal of Finland and the\nEuropean Union, and we must not allow it to be\nundermined. The ICC must not become an issue of\ninternational dispute. We must safeguard it as an\neffective and independent judicial institution so that we\ncan convince those States that remain outside it to join\nus in making it truly universal.\nTerrorism is only one of many new threats to our\nsecurity that are no longer linked to the threat of\ntraditional war between nation-States.\nIn a world where our entire national defence\npolicies and our efforts to build collective security\nhave been based on the need to wage or deter\ntraditional war, we now need new and fresh thinking. It\nis not only that military power has become partly\nimpotent in delivering security. It is also evident that\nwe cannot contain these threats through isolation or by\nacting unilaterally.\nThe United Nations and its Security Council have\nglobal responsibility for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. Human lives are\nequally valuable all over the world. People in crisis\nsituations need the protection and the action of the\ninternational community. Individual and minor crises\ncan turn into major threats to international peace and\nsecurity. Member States must give the United Nations\nthe wherewithal that is necessary for meaningful action\nin preventing crises, managing conflicts and building\npeace after conflicts. Action needs true commitment to\nmultilateralism, which must exceed national interests\nand unilateralism. Multilateralism cannot be exercised\n\u00e0 la carte whenever convenient. Global interests require\nglobal action.\nAn undeniable success story in the history of the\nUnited Nations is the Organization's peacekeeping\nactivities. Countless lives have been saved by United\nNations peacekeeping operations. But we know, too,\nthat possibly even more lives have been lost if and\nwhen the United Nations has not been able or allowed\nto operate. The reason has been the lack of political\nwill or the prevalence of national interests in the\nSecurity Council. I would like to reiterate that the\nSecurity Council is mandated to act on behalf of all\nMember States.\nThe concept of peacekeeping has evolved\nconsiderably during the existence of the United Nations\nfrom purely military operations into versatile, complex\nand continuous efforts that extend in some cases to\nnation-building. A growing element in them is civilian\ncrisis management. This should be further\nstrengthened. Crisis management in its whole\ncontinuum should also be based on broad cooperation\nand compatibility. Present complex crises are often too\ndemanding for any one organization to deal with. All\nregional organizations should work closely together\nwith the United Nations and other organizations\nsharing the burden of maintaining international peace\nand security.\nThe Middle East remains the region where our\nconcerns are most concentrated. The conflict between\nIsrael and Palestine has, if anything, worsened. We\nsupport all efforts of the \u201cquartet\u201d to get the peace\nprocess working again on the basis of the relevant\nUnited Nations resolutions. We support the Palestinian\nadministration's effort at reform, which we have rightly\ndemanded must be undertaken, and we expect a one-\nhundred-per-cent effort from it to stop all terrorist\nactivities. At the same time, the Palestinians must be\ngiven the prospect of a clear commitment and a\ntimetable for the creation of an independent and viable\nPalestinian State. The Palestinian administration has to\nbe given the resources and conditions with which it can\nfulfil the requirements of what the international\ncommunity demands of it and of what the Palestinian\npeople have the right to expect.\nWithout progress in the Middle East peace\nprocess, any military action in the region can have\nextremely dangerous and unforeseen consequences. It\nis imperative that efforts to get Iraq to abide\nunconditionally with all the resolutions of the Security\nCouncil remain the responsibility of the United\nNations.\nWhen the United Nations was founded, the\nworld's population was 2.4 billion. Now we are more\nthan 6 billion, and population growth, while slowly\nlevelling off, will bring that number to at least 10\nbillion before stabilizing. This is a huge challenge for\nmankind. We have only a few decades, at most, to\n26\n\nbring our economic, production and societal models to\nconform to the exigencies of sustainable development.\nBut this is not only an environmental challenge.\nNations and peoples must learn to live and to act\ntogether in an ever-shrinking world where no one can\nmanage on his own.\nIn a rapidly globalizing world, the need for keen\ninternational cooperation becomes all the more evident.\nDecisions taken in one part of the world have many\neffects elsewhere. This can quickly lead to an ever-\nwidening gap and fragmentation between countries and\nwithin countries. Comprehensive implementation of the\nMillennium Declaration will make an important impact\non narrowing that gap. A positive example of the\nmeans we can employ to meet the goals of the\nDeclaration is the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment (NEPAD), which demonstrates the\ngenuine desire of the African nations to take\nresponsibility for their future. Finland attaches great\nimportance to the implementation of NEPAD.\nGlobalization has wealth-creating potential\nthrough the international division of labour and a more\nefficient use of resources. It can increase individual\nfreedom and make societies more open. But, on the\nother hand, it is incontestable that globalization has not\nbenefited everybody or every country in an equal\nmanner. Globalization can bring risks and threats to the\nenvironment, core labour standards and trade unions,\nand it can challenge national and minority cultures. It\ncan also be socially damaging. On the whole, however,\nglobalization is not only inevitable but also potentially\npositive. The United Nations has an important role in\nmanaging and harnessing globalization for the benefit\nof all. We the Member States must fully participate in\nthat work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to\nbegin by extending my warmest congratulations to\nyou \u2013\u2013 my colleague Mr. Jan Kavan \u2014 on his election\nas President of the fifty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly.\nI cannot but remember the tragedy of 11\nSeptember 2001, the anniversary of which we\ncommemorated just a few days ago. That bloody act\ncommitted here in New York, the host city of the\nUnited Nations Headquarters, was directed not only\nagainst the United States but also against all the rest of\nus, the entire civilized world that the United Nations\nsymbolizes. Georgia has been part of the anti-terrorist\ncoalition from the very first day. I would like to assure\nthe Assembly that Georgia has been doing everything\nin its power to be a dedicated partner in this struggle\nand that it will maintain the spirit of cooperation until\nthe very, successful end.\nThe problem of international terrorism is complex\nand multidimensional, and I had intended to share our\nviews and thoughts on that. However, the recent\ncomplications in Georgian-Russian relations have\ncompelled me to shift the focus of my address. I am\nreferring to the mounting aggressive attacks on my\ncountry's sovereignty emanating from the Russian\nauthorities and media. On a daily basis, Georgia is\nbeing accused of harbouring terrorists, aiding fighters\nand fueling the conflict in Chechnya. This is a clear\nattempt to create an enemy image of Georgia in\nRussia's public opinion. Here I have to state clearly:\nthis is utter nonsense.\nWe believe that the pressure exerted on my\ncountry under the pretext of these absurd accusations is\nbeing used by Russia as a smokescreen to hide its own\nfailure to cope with the conflict in Chechnya. As\nPresident Shevardnadze stated in his letter, transmitted\nby our Permanent Representative in identical letters\naddressed to the Secretary-General and to the President\nof the Security Council, \u201cIt is hard to imagine a clearer\nexample of confusing the cause and the effect\u201d.\n(A/57/408, annex)\nThe truth is that this tragic chain of events started\nwith the conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia, in which\nChechen fighters, citizens of the Russia Federation,\nhad been initially recruited, trained and sent to fight.\nThen, all of this boomeranged in the Chechen conflict\nagainst Russia, when those fighters turned their arms\nagainst their own patrons. As a result of two Chechen\nwars, Georgia has had to face an influx of thousands of\nChechen refugees, and armed gangs of criminals forced\ninto Georgia, followed by insistence from the Russian\nside on permitting a military operation against them on\nGeorgian soil. All this meant a spillover of the endless\nand bloody war into Georgia, which we certainly could\nnot allow. We are able to take, and are already taking,\nall necessary measures to uproot any possibility of the\nuse of our territory by terrorists.\nAlthough it is evident that the problem of the\nPankisi Gorge of Georgia is a side effect of the war in\nChechnya, and not vice versa, the violations of airspace\nand attacks against the sovereign territory of Georgia\n\nby Russian military jets and helicopters have acquired\na permanent character. The most recent air strike took\nplace on 23 August 2002, causing civilian casualties.\nGeorgia has irrefutable documentary and factual\nevidence of the attack, which has also been confirmed\nby the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope border monitoring operation.\nDespite the clear evidence, the Russian military\nleadership cynically denies these facts, trying to avoid\nan objective investigation in spite of their official\nstatements that one will be carried out. Moreover,\nunfolding hysteria in Russia on the issue of the Pankisi\nGorge has culminated in statements by Russia's\nPresident and its military openly threatening Georgia\nwith aggression. These actions not only gravely\nendanger peace and security in the region, but also\nundermine the efforts of the global anti-terrorist\ncoalition to fight against this menace.\nWhat is at stake here is not only the sovereignty\nand independence of Georgia, but also the very\nfundamentals of the current international system. That\nis why we have brought this issue to this high forum.\nAs I mentioned, Georgian special forces, aided by\nour friends, are conducting an operation to restore law\nand order in the Pankisi Gorge and the surrounding\narea. We already have achieved positive results and are\nready to cooperate with all concerned parties, including\nRussia. Moreover, we are open to all international\ntransparency measures.\nWe call on the Russian side to reconsider their\napproach and, as President Shevardnadze stressed in\nhis letter, we appeal \u201cto the leadership of Russia and\nthe President himself to find a common tongue [and] to\nrise above the existing problems\u201d. (ibid.) We strongly\nbelieve that there is no other way out.\nSpeaking about the conflicts in the Caucasus, I\nwould like to draw attention to the most painful issue:\nthe conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia, where our joint\nefforts have not yet been successful. I believe that the\nmajor mistake made by the international organizations\nwas to give the so-called Abkhaz authorities an\nopportunity to engage them in endless and absurd\ndisputes because of which the bases of the peace\nprocess were ignored.\nFirst, there is Georgia, a full-fledged member of\nthe international community, whose internationally\nrecognized territory is being violated by the non-\nlegitimate, pseudo-Abkhaz regime based on hostility\nand ethnic cleansing. No positive results can be\nachieved if the two sides are treated in the same\nmanner, if they are viewed as equally responsible and if\na policy of pleasing both of them is pursued.\nSecondly, there is the fate of the more than\n300,000 refugees and internally displaced persons who\nhave been ousted from their homeland and deprived of\ntheir basic human rights, and whose prospect of return\nhas for the past eight years failed to go beyond fruitless\ndiscussions. The years of ineffective negotiations merit\nonly those conclusions.\nI must excuse myself before the authors of the\nmost recent Security Council resolution on this matter,\nCouncil resolution 1427 (2002), but I cannot agree with\nthe softness of their statements. Even though the de\nfacto Abkhaz leadership completely ignored and\ncategorically refused to receive the document, \u201cBasic\nPrinciples for the Distribution of Competences between\nTbilisi and Sukhumi\u201d, elaborated by the Group of\nFriends of the Secretary-General, the arrogance of the\nseparatist regime was responded to in the resolution\nonly by a slight reproach.\nTo our surprise, the most recent report of the\nSecretary-General, based on information from the\nUnited Nations Human Rights Office in Abkhazia,\nGeorgia, points to \u201ca modest improvement in the\nhuman rights situation\u201d. (S/2002/742, para. 23) It is\ndifficult to understand what kind of improvement is\nmeant when the separatists insist that Georgian\nchildren should study Georgian as a foreign language at\nGeorgian schools in Abkhazia, Georgia.\nThe tragedy in Abkhazia, Georgia, where\nhundreds of thousands, mostly ethnic Georgians, have\nbeen forcibly expelled from their homes, has numerous\ntimes been rightfully assessed by the Organization for\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe as ethnic\ncleansing. Thus, we can only be astonished that the\nUnited Nations is so reluctant to make the same\nstatement. This is the more so as the Abkhaz side has\nnever complied with any of the 28 Security Council\nresolutions adopted since 1993. I hope members would\nagree that such inconsistency only strengthens the\nseparatists' self-confidence and increases their belief in\ntheir impunity.\nIn 1994 we made an unprecedented decision by\nasking the United Nations to permit the commencement\nof a peacekeeping operation engaging the\n8\n\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS), whereby\nthe \u201ccollective\u201d peacekeeping forces included only a\nRussian military contingent. The reason for this was\nthe complete absence of other alternatives at that time.\nRegrettably, eight years of this operation have made\nclear that the Russian peacekeepers, acting under the\nCIS aegis, fail to ensure the security that is so\nnecessary for the return of the internally displaced\npersons and refugees to their homes in Abkhazia,\nGeorgia. In fact, the peacekeepers have established an\nartificial border between the territory controlled by the\nseparatists and the rest of Georgia.\nOn that basis, we think it is high time to\ntransform substantively the ongoing peacekeeping\noperation. In particular, we are in favour of introducing\na civil police component and creating a joint Georgian-\nAbkhaz administration in the Gali district under\ninternational auspices. Considering the solid United\nNations experience in the establishment and\nmanagement of international police forces, we have\nhigh expectations of the Assembly's support.\nWe strongly believe that more active involvement\nof the international community, and primarily of the\nUnited Nations, is indispensable. We understand that\nthe United Nations is currently involved in several\npeacekeeping operations. Irrespective of that fact, we\nhope that some resources can be found to ensure more\nactive United Nations engagement in the resolution of\nthe conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia.\nSpeaking about the ineffectiveness of\ninternational efforts in resolving the Abkhaz conflict,\nwe should admit that the lack of unanimity within the\nGroup of Friends of the Secretary-General remains a\nserious impeding factor. That is why it took almost two\nyears just to win consensus on the so-called Boden\ndocument. Moreover, we are repeatedly faced with\nactions by one of the members of the Group that are\nutterly inconsistent with the general approach.\nAt the end of 2000, the Russian Federation\nintroduced a visa regime with Georgia. But contrary to\nthe elementary norms of international law, the right to\nvisa-free movement has been maintained for the\nsecessionist regions of Georgia: the Abkhazia and\nTskhinvali regions. Numerous protests by the Georgian\nside against this discriminatory decision have been\nsimply ignored. Moreover, this was followed by the\nmass issue of Russian passports to the local population\nof these two separatist regions, and their mass\nconversion to Russian citizenship through simplified\nprocedures. Here a question arises: how do these\nactions, named \u201clegal expansion\u201d even by the Russian\nmedia, contribute to a peaceful resolution of these\nconflicts?\nI have to reaffirm that a peaceful resolution of the\nconflict in Abkhazia, Georgia, remains the only\nacceptable option for my Government. But as I have\nalready mentioned, regrettably, the Abkhaz side has\ncategorically refused to consider the document that\ndetermines the political status of Abkhazia within the\nState of Georgia. Therefore, we have to admit that the\nentire peace process in Abkhazia, Georgia, is as much\nin jeopardy as it is in need of drastic changes. We call\non the United Nations to address this problem.\nFinally, United Nations reform has long been a\ntopic of discussion. It is unfortunate that work in that\nregard has not progressed beyond an exchange of ideas.\nToo much time has been devoted to discussions on\nSecurity Council enlargement, the increase of the\nnumber of its permanent and non-permanent members,\nthe change of procedures related to the right of veto\nand the adoption of joint decisions. Regrettably, there\nhave been no practical results so far.\nHere I would like to stress that Georgia reiterates\nits full support for the speedy realization of the\naforesaid changes. We strongly support granting\npermanent membership to Germany and Japan, as well\nas the overall enlargement of the Security Council. We\nalso insist on increased transparency in the work of the\nCouncil.\nThe world community is currently facing\nnumerous challenges which require more decisive and\nradical steps. And I cherish the hope that this forum\nwill be courageous enough to make them without delay.\n\n\n\n"

Thanks to his leadership, our Organization has\nbeen able to cross a number of important frontiers in\nthe year since we last met.\nLastly, my delegation warmly congratulates East\nTimor on its full transition to democracy, its successful\nconduct of democratic elections, its recent accession to\nindependence and its subsequent admission into our\nUnited Nations family. Our congratulations also go to\nthe Government and people of Switzerland on acceding\nto full membership of the United Nations as the 190th\nand newest Member State.\nOur session is being convened at a time when the\nanniversary of the dastardly 11 September attack on the\nUnited States is being observed. We join the rest of the\nworld, including the families of the victims, in\nremembering those who lost their lives and we pray\nthat almighty God grant them eternal rest. Gambians\nwere among the thousands from many nations of the\nworld who were victims of the attack. This only goes to\nshow that terrorism knows no national boundaries. In\ncommemorating 11 September, President Jammeh\ndeclared a public holiday for people to stay home and\npray. We must therefore harness all our efforts and\ncooperate effectively to address this wicked\nphenomenon and its root causes.\nLet me take this opportunity to commend the\nCounter-Terrorism Committee established pursuant to\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) for the good\nwork that it is doing in enhancing cooperation in the\nfield of counter-terrorism. In the course of this year,\nthe Gambia was able to accede to all the major treaties\nrelating to terrorism and we are currently in the process\nof implementing resolution 1373 (2001).\nThe year 2002 has been a busy one for us all.\nFirst, we came here for the special session on children.\nThen, we went off to Monterrey for the International\nConference on Financing for Development, and we just\nrecently concluded our deliberations on sustainable\ndevelopment in Johannesburg, South Africa. At each of\nthese important forums, we were offered the\nopportunity of rededicating ourselves to the noble\nobjectives of our Organization, especially those that\nwere so strongly evinced at the Millennium Summit\nand enshrined in the millennium development goals,\nwhich we all espoused.\nThrough our deliberations at these meetings in\nthe course of this year, we have recommitted ourselves\nto striving in a more purposeful and determined manner\nto spread and deepen democracy throughout the world;\ndo better in protecting human rights, fundamental\nhuman freedoms and the rule of law; strengthen our\n17\n\ncooperation in the fight against hunger, poverty and\ndisease; do more to protect the weak and vulnerable in\nour respective societies, particularly children, the aged\nand the handicapped; and redouble our efforts to\nsanitize and preserve the physical and human ecology\nand environment. These are some of the important\npillars on which world peace and security are built and\nwhich we must consciously work to strengthen and\npreserve from crumbling. That is the only sure way that\nglobal security and development, which are at the core\nof our Organization's mandate, can be assured.\nWe in the Gambia have been doing all we can to\nstay the course in the uphill task of nation-building\nunder the inspired and dynamic leadership of President\nAl Hadji Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh. In the area of good\ngovernance, I am pleased to inform this body that, with\nspecial reference to the democratization process,\nfollowing the much-acclaimed presidential elections\nheld last October, National Assembly elections were\nheld on 17 January and local Government elections on\n25 April 2002. Mindful of the need to cultivate the\nculture of democracy and good governance, the\nGovernment of the Gambia has since developed and\nadopted a national governance policy and programme.\nThe main components of the policy framework\nare constitutional review and reform of electoral\nprocesses; enhancing parliamentary structures and\nprocesses; civic education; reform of legal and judicial\nprocesses and constitutional review; public sector\nmanagement and administrative reform; and\ndecentralization and reform of local Government\nsystems. Clearly, governance constitutes an important\ncomponent of our poverty reduction strategy.\nHalfway through the United Nations Decade for\nthe Eradication of Poverty, and in spite of all the\ncommitments we have made over the years to reduce\npoverty and to accelerate the pace of social and\neconomic development throughout the world, the gap\nbetween the rich and the poor is widening and the\nabsolute number of poor people, especially in the\ndeveloping world, is increasing. The scourge of\npoverty is insidious. It contains within itself all the\nelements that militate against its victim's ability to rise\nabove his or her condition.\nTherefore, fighting poverty calls for conscious,\ndeliberate interventions that only the strong can\nprovide to help the weak. These interventions come,\nfor the most part, in the form of resource flows.\nUnfortunately, these have been dwindling over the\nyears and, in spite of the recent commitments made by\nthe G8 countries in Kananaskis in support of the new\nAfrican initiative \u2014 the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment (NEPAD), for which we are grateful \u2014\noverall, the shortfalls in the fight against poverty are\nstill huge and growing.\n\nThe international community should not lead\nAfrican countries to disenchantment. The Heavily\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative is, for the most\npart, still good only on paper, largely speaking.\nProtectionist policies and heavy subsidies continue to\nfrustrate our efforts to earn a decent living through\nproduction and trade. And the promises of increased\nofficial development assistance and other forms of\nassistance over four United Nations Development\nDecades have remained largely unfulfilled. In fact, this\nsession of the General Assembly will look into the\nimplementation of the United Nations New Agenda for\nthe Development of Africa in the 1990s, and the main\nconclusion will be that, by and large, the commitments\nmade by Africa's development partners have not been\nmet. We missed another opportunity for the multilateral\nsystem to work towards poverty eradication and social\nand economic development.\nWith special reference to the plight of least\ndeveloped countries, I would like to add the Gambia's\nvoice to those of previous speakers in calling for a\nrenewed commitment to implementing the programme\nof action for the least developed countries for the\ndecade 2001-2010. In that connection, we commend\nthe General Assembly for the decision taken to\nestablish the Office of the High Representative for the\nLeast Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing\nCountries and Small Island Developing States. We look\nforward to working closely with the High\nRepresentative.\nThe recently held ministerial meeting of least\ndeveloped countries in Cotonou was indeed timely, and\nwe call on the rest of the international community to\nlend its full support to the least developed countries so\nthat we implement fully the decisions taken. We\ncannot, however, discuss the issue of poverty\nalleviation without mentioning the problem of women\nand children. With regard to our women folk, we need\nto focus more on the 12 critical areas of concern laid\nout in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action,\n18\n\nincluding gender inequalities. As for the issues\nconcerning children, we hope that the follow-up\nsummit held here in New York recently will strengthen\nus in our resolve to achieve the noble goals that we\nhave set for ourselves to give our children a brighter\nfuture.\nFor our part, in the Gambia we have evolved a\nstrong and focused policy on poverty, which we have\narticulated in a programme of action for poverty\nalleviation. The strategy is anchored on my\nGovernment's commitment to eradicate poverty in the\nlong term, by increasing income through economic\ngrowth and empowering the population with the\ncapacity for sustainable development. Our fight against\npoverty stands on five pillars: the creation of an\nenabling environment for economic growth and\ndevelopment, enhancing the productive capacity and\nsocial protection of the poor, improving coverage of\nbasic services, political empowerment of civil society,\nand strengthened partnerships with development\nstakeholders. My Government is committed to\nrelentlessly pursuing those objectives in line with the\nobjectives of the Millennium Development Goals. In\nthat, we shall be counting on the wholehearted support\nof the international community.\nAt this juncture, I would like to express my\nGovernment's most profound gratitude to our principal\npartners in development and to the donor community at\nlarge for their active participation at the sixth\nRoundtable Donors Conference for the Gambia, held in\nGeneva on 18 and 19 September 2002. We are\nconfident that all the pledges made will be honoured so\nthat together, in the true spirit of international\nsolidarity, we will implement smoothly and\nsuccessfully our national programme of action for\npoverty alleviation.\nThat is all the more urgent considering the fact\nthat, during the rainy season this year, we experienced\na long dry spell initially, resulting in the poor\nperformance of both crops and livestock.\nIt is our hope that all nations of the world will\nredouble their efforts to live up to the commitments\nthey made in Rio and, just recently, reaffirmed in\nJohannesburg. Even as we search for ways of taking\nour people out of poverty, we should also be mindful of\nthe need to conserve our natural environment.\nOf particular concern to my delegation are the\ndestructive fishing practices in the South Atlantic.\nDespite the adoption of numerous international\ninstruments to regulate fishing with a view to\nconserving fish stocks, unsustainable and often illegal\nfishing continues unabated in our coastal waters. The\nunbridled pursuit of profit without due regard to\nsustainability and long-term food security is the only\nreason for that undesirable situation. My delegation\ntherefore calls on all Member States to cooperate with\nus to address this serious state of affairs and to provide\nus with technical and other forms of assistance to\nenable all affected countries to better police their\nwaters in order to arrest those unsustainable and\nharmful fishing practices.\nThe momentum generated in Johannesburg must\nnot be allowed to wither away. It must be recognized,\nhowever, that there can be no meaningful development\nwithout peace and stability. That is why we attach great\nimportance to the issue of peacekeeping.\nIn the field of peacekeeping, our Organization\ncontinues to score remarkable successes. We appreciate\nthe efforts of the Security Council to put in place a\nrapid response mechanism through which a\nmultinational force could quickly be deployed to any\npart of the world. However, there is need to ensure that\nadequate resources are made available so that no\npeacekeeping operation is disrupted on account of lack\nof funds, thereby plunging the countries concerned\nback into a vortex of violence. Funding availability is\nalso important to bridge the gap between peacekeeping\nand national reconstruction.\nThe determination with which we have dealt with\nthreats to peace has paid handsome dividends in the\nperiod since we last met. That is why we welcome the\ngreat efforts made to distinguish the existing conflicts\nin Africa, especially in Sierra Leone, the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo and Angola.\nWith regard to the Sudan, my Government\napplauds the signing of the Machacos Protocol between\nthe Government and the Sudanese People's Liberation\nArmy (SPLA). We hope and pray that the process now\nstarted will finally bring that protracted conflict to an\nend.\nWhile we may rightly commend ourselves on\nthose achievements, we must not rest on our oars.\nThere are still some significant areas of uncertainty and\nvolatility in our own West African subregion that we\nneed to address. That requires a relentless effort.\n19\n\nIn our capacity as coordinator of the Group of\nfriends of Guinea-Bissau, here at the United Nations,\nwe are calling on the rest of the international\ncommunity to provide more assistance to that sister\ncountry. In that way, the democratization process will\nbe consolidated and the country's economic\nperformance enhanced.\nWe must bear in mind that ending hostilities is\none thing and getting the system on the right path to\nsocial and economic development of the type that\nwould eliminate the causes of conflict is quite another.\nIn like manner, a successful transition into a\ndemocratic dispensation does not necessarily, in and of\nitself, usher in peace and security. In many of the\ncountries where conflicts have ended, political stability\nremains fragile, and uncertainty and instability prevail.\nIn those countries, there is need to go beyond the\nimmediate political requirements for consolidating\npeace, to address governance in its broadest sense,\nincluding its economic and financial aspects, as well as\nthe capacities required for strengthening it. That is the\nemerging challenge for the international community.\nWe must devise mechanisms for follow-through into\npeace-building and be ready to provide the resources to\nprogressively restore confidence and strength among\nthose at the frontline.\nPresident Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh, the Government\nand people of the Gambia are fully committed to the\nsearch for peace and the resolution of conflicts\neverywhere, particularly in our immediate subregion.\nThat is why we not only open our doors to our\nneighbours in distress, hosting many refugees, but we\nalso work actively with them as well as with other\nmembers of the international community, including the\nSecretary-General and his able team to remove\nmisunderstandings that could easily lead to a flare up\nof conflict.\nThe situation in the Middle East remains a matter\nof grave concern to my delegation. The Security\nCouncil must show more leadership in the efforts of the\ninternational community to contain and resolve the\nserious tensions between Israel and Palestine, which\npose a grave threat to the stability of the nations in the\nregion and the peace of the whole world. It is\nunacceptable for the world to stand back and watch as\nhelpless civilians are attacked in refugee camps or are\nkilled or maimed by suicide bombers. The suffering of\ninnocent people in the Middle East must be brought to\nan end immediately.\nMy delegation strongly urges, therefore, that all\nthe relevant United Nations resolutions on Palestine\nand the Middle East, notably Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), be complied\nwith without further delay. We also fully support those\nwho have called for the recognition of the State of\nIsrael by all nations, as well as the creation and the\nrecognition by all of a State of Palestine.\nElsewhere in the Middle East, there are still some\nunresolved issues. The situation between Iraq and\nKuwait has still not been fully resolved, and we are\nstill seeking a satisfactory resolution of the question of\nthe Kuwaiti prisoners of war and missing persons, as\nwell as the return of the Kuwaiti national archives.\nWithin Iraq itself, we in the Gambia have always\ncalled for the alleviation of the suffering of the\ninnocent Iraqi people. With regard to the other\nunfinished business of weapons inspections, my\ndelegation applauds the decision of the Government of\nIraq to invite the United Nations weapons inspectors to\nreturn to Iraq to resume their work. We have always\nupheld the view that parties to any dispute should\nallow the United Nations to assume its responsibility\nunhindered in our common quest for amicable closure\nto conflict situations. We therefore note with\nsatisfaction the important statement made by President\nBush recognizing the central role of the United Nations\nand calling on the latter to assume its responsibility.\nBut let us also remember that we, all of us \u2014 nations\nbig and small, rich and poor \u2014 constitute the United\nNations. It can be only what we the Member States\nwant it to be. The choice is ours.\nIn South Asia, we cannot be indifferent to the\nprevailing situation between India and Pakistan. Those\nare two great countries with which the Gambia has\nalways enjoyed excellent relations. We are therefore\ncalling on them, out of that friendship, to exercise\nrestraint at all times and to withdraw their troops from\ntheir respective borders.\nAfter years of hard work and tough negotiations,\nwe finally succeeded in establishing the International\nCriminal Court (ICC), with the entry into force of the\nRome Statute. We salute the tireless efforts of all those\nwho contributed in one way or another to that huge\nsuccess. It is our fervent hope that the Court, with the\nactive collaboration of all like-minded States, will act\nas an effective instrument in the fight against\n20\n\ninternational crimes of all sorts and, by extension,\nextinguish the culture of impunity.\nTurning now to the issue of sanctions, my\ndelegation firmly believes that the time has now come\nfor us to review the procedure being used to impose\nsanctions on countries and individuals. The permanent\nmembers of the Security Council, who determine who\nshould be placed on a sanctions or travel ban list, do\nnot usually provide evidence, either to the individual\nconcerned or to his Government, to justify their\ndecision. We have come to see that in many cases, such\ndecisions are based on speculation and conjecture and\nthat the individuals in question really did not deserve to\nbe punished and humiliated. Thus far, most\nGovernments have been very cooperative and, while\nrepeatedly requesting to no avail that evidence of\nwrong-doing be made known to them, have nonetheless\ngone along with the rest of the international community\nin respecting the decision taken by the Council. Some\nof those Governments, mine included, are reaching the\npoint of exasperation and have resolved that, unless the\nevidence being requested of the Security Council is\nprovided, they will refuse to comply with any ban or\nsanctions imposed on their nationals. We sometimes\nwonder whether someone out there does not have a\nhidden agenda. As sovereign nations, we demand more\ntransparency before acquiescing to our nationals being\npunished for wrongdoings that we have not been shown\nthey have committed. The United Nations Security\nCouncil must not be a bully.\nIn like manner, the multifaceted sanctions\nimposed on Cuba are still in place despite numerous\nresolutions calling for their removal. A window of\nopportunity now exists for them to be finally set aside.\nIt is in nobody's interest to continue to pursue policies\nagainst Cuba that have lost their appeal.\nSabres are rattling on one side of the Taiwan\nStrait in the face of 23 million souls, for their merely\nhaving claimed their God-given right to be recognized\nas a political, economic and social entity. The Republic\nof China on Taiwan is today the only country on earth\nthat is not represented in the United Nations, contrary\nto the main guiding principle of the United Nations: the\nprinciple of universality. Article four of the Charter\ninvites \u201call ... peace-loving States\u201d to become Members\nof the Organization. The people of Taiwan have\ndemonstrated over the years not only that they are\npeace-loving but also that they can contribute to all the\nobjectives of the United Nations in the fields of global\nsecurity, financial stability, culture, industrial and\ntechnological growth and sustainable development.\nTaiwan is not an insignificant player in the world\nproduction and trade arena. It is the world's sixteenth\nlargest economy. It is equally highly developed in the\nfield of scientific and medical research.\nIn recognition of its importance as a trading\nnation, it was recently admitted into the World Trade\nOrganization. Logic demands that, for the very same\nreason, it should also be admitted into the World\nHealth Organization in recognition of its importance as\na country of highly sophisticated and developed health\nservices; into the United Nations Educational,\nScientific and Cultural Organization because of its\nexceptionally high standing in the fields of science and\nculture; into the United Nations Industrial\nDevelopment Organization because of its most\nadvanced industrial and technological development;\ninto the United Nations Children's Fund because of its\nhighly developed child development policies and\nprogrammes; into the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization, the International Fund for Agricultural\nDevelopment and the World Food Programme because\nof its extremely well developed agriculture and its\nimportance as a food producer; and into the United\nNations Development Programme because of its huge\nofficial development assistance to developing countries\nfor capacity-building and poverty alleviation. In short,\nit should be admitted into all branches of the United\nNations family because of the tremendous\ncontributions it could make to the ideals and\nprogrammes of the United Nations.\nTaiwan is a vibrant democracy with high ratings\non human rights, press freedom and the observance of\nthe rights of the individual. It could contribute\nimmensely to global security and the fight against\nterrorism. It is therefore baffling that this highly\ndeveloped, friendly and peace-loving nation has been\nbarred from membership in the United Nations for\npurely political reasons. My Government will not rest\nuntil this injustice is undone and the Republic of China\non Taiwan is granted its rightful place among the\ncomity of nations.\nStill in the same region, with regard to the Korean\nPeninsula, my delegation would like to reiterate once\nagain our unflinching support for all the efforts geared\ntowards peaceful unification.\n21\n\nFinally, my delegation believes that the General\nAssembly needs to be strengthened so that it could play\nan even greater role in our quest for a just and\nequitable world order. We welcome the moves being\nmade to reform this important organ of the United\nNations in ways that would render it more effective in\ndischarging its mandate.\nThis is particularly true of the Security Council.\nWe in the Gambia will continue to add our voice to the\nclamour for the Security Council to be reformed in\norder to make it more democratic and more in tune\nwith the realities of and requirements for global\nsecurity in the twenty-first century. The credibility and\nrelevance of the Security Council now depend on the\nreforms that we all have been calling for. The\ndeveloping countries must be allowed a much more\neffective participation in this powerful organ of the\nUnited Nations. Africa should have a minimum of two\npermanent seats.\nIn conclusion, we urge all nations, great and\nsmall, to work relentlessly towards preserving the\nideals for which the Organization was set up. We\nshould all eschew behaviours that undermine the\nobjectives of the United Nations and that frustrate its\nefforts. Multilateralism is the only hope left to mankind\nfor the peaceful resolution of conflicts and the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. Let us\ncherish and nurture it. Multilateralism will thrive only\nif there is trust and confidence among all the actors.\nBut a system that repeatedly frustrates and lets down\none portion of its membership will malfunction and\neventually become ineffective and irrelevant. We must\ntherefore all do more to ensure that such a fate does not\nbefall our Organization.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to express, on behalf of the people\nand the Government of El Salvador, our most sincere\ncongratulations to the President on being elected to\nconduct the work of this session of the General\nAssembly.\nLikewise, we would like to express our\nrecognition to Mr. Han Seung-soo for the successful\nwork he carried out during the past session. We\ncommend Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his work\nand attention in the prevention and solution of\nconflicts, and we encourage him to continue moving\nforward in the reform process of the United Nations.\n26\n\nWe welcome to this important world forum the\nSwiss Confederation and, soon, the Democratic\nRepublic of Timor-Leste in their new capacity of\nMember States. In this context, we reiterate our request\nto review the special international situation of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan, whose 23 million\ninhabitants are being denied the right to representation\nin this forum. We nurture the hope that in the near\nfuture the participation in this world Organization of\nall the nations of the world without exclusion \u2014 as is\ncurrently the case with Taiwan \u2014 will become a\nreality.\nThe Government of El Salvador is convinced that\nit is necessary to examine new and visionary initiatives\nto remove existing obstacles in the discussions on the\ncomposition and role of the Security Council in the\nnew millennium. That is necessary and essential in\norder for the United Nations to continue to be the\nprincipal world forum of collective action in the face of\nchallenges to international peace and security.\nThis year, my country commemorated the tenth\nanniversary of the signing of the peace accords, which\nput an end to armed conflict and paved the way for a\nnew reality of hope, peace, democracy and\ndevelopment. Our democratic process has\nprogressively been consolidated and is advancing with\nnormality within the same dynamic of open debates\nand deliberations that characterize all democracies.\nThis has been a result of the firm desire of all\nSalvadorians to construct a free and democratic society,\nwhich we, the Member States, should feel proud of and\npart of, through the successful role played by the\nUnited Nations.\nIn the economic and social fields, we have\nachieved significant progress in strengthening peace\nand democracy. The Government of President\nFrancisco Flores P\u00e9rez has strongly promoted an\neconomic model featuring economic rights as a means\nto advance towards development and to take advantage\nof the opportunities offered by the opportunities of\nglobalization. We have also favoured human\ndevelopment, investing primarily in education, health,\nhousing and basic services, as those areas are\nindispensable elements contributing to social well-\nbeing, to the improvement in the quality of life of our\npeople and to development.\nTen years after the signing of the peace accords,\nEl Salvador has successfully culminated its peace\nprocess and is now enjoying the dividends of peace.\nTherefore, we are grateful for the valuable support of\nthe international community and of the United Nations.\nWe are particularly grateful to the Group of Friends of\nthe Secretary-General for the peace process of El\nSalvador \u2014 Colombia, Mexico, Spain, Venezuela and\nthe United States of America \u2014 for the support they\noffered during the unfolding of that process, whose\nsuccessful outcome continues to assist efforts for\nconflict resolution throughout the world.\nWith regard to Central America, I wish to\nreaffirm El Salvador's spirit of integration, which leads\nus to attach high priority to our relations with\nneighbouring countries in seeking common\ndevelopment for the region and in strengthening the\nCentral American integration process in its political,\neconomic and social facets. We do so because it is only\nthrough a stable and united region that we will be able\nto complement one another in order to strengthen our\nposition in the world economic environment and jointly\nface the challenges of globalization. Only through\nintegration will we be able to overcome our narrow\nterritorial limitations to effectively respond to the just\ndemands of our citizens in the areas of education,\nhealth and opportunities for the future. Being united\nand open to the world as a region will be the only way\nwe will be able to cease to appear small in the face of\nthe great challenge of creating, with all the requisite\nspeed, more and better jobs so that all our peoples will\nbe able to forge for themselves a worthy future in their\nown homelands.\nIt is in that context that the Presidents of Central\nAmerica have agreed on an economic integration plan\nof action effective immediately. That plan includes the\nformation of a customs union by next year. Likewise,\namong other things, we will continue to work on\nadopting common duty tariffs and facilitating trade and\nthe free movement of all products. With that goal in\nmind, and having already attained positive results with\nthe Central American agreements now in effect with\nMexico, the Dominican Republic, Chile and Panama,\nwe are also jointly negotiating free trade agreements\nwith Canada and United States. We are also working to\nstrengthen and implement the Puebla-Panama Plan by\nimplementing eight large meso-American integration\nprojects. Through the Puebla-Panama Plan we intend to\ntake advantage of the potential of Central America and\nof the southern and south-eastern regions of Mexico as\n27\n\na natural corridor linking North and South America and\njoining two oceans.\nWe have responsibly assumed the historical\nchallenge to address through relevant bodies the border\ndisagreements inherited by the current generation of\nCentral Americans. El Salvador has done its share in\nthis regard. We are convinced that strict compliance\nwith international law provides the foundation for\nharmony among neighbouring countries. We have\ntherefore recently reached an agreement at the\npresidential level with the Republic of Honduras to\naccelerate the demarcation of our territorial borders.\nFurthermore, we have also recently resorted to the\nInternational Court of Justice to exercise our right to\nrequest a revision of its 1992 judgement, but only with\nregard to one of the six areas in dispute in the case that\nwe jointly submitted in 1986. Through these efforts, El\nSalvador and Central America are clearing the way in\norder to make unencumbered progress towards the\nrealization of our common integration projects. In the\nend, our goal is for the borders that we are now\ndefining through law to be erased in practice by\nharmony, mutual respect and the development of our\npeoples.\nIn the international sphere \u2014 having just\ncommemorated the first anniversary of the terrorist\nattacks perpetrated in the United States \u2014 the\nGovernment of El Salvador would like to reiterate its\nfirm commitment to the worldwide struggle against\nterrorism and all related criminal activities. We view\nthis global effort as a joint and individual endeavour of\nMember States. Consequently, we see it as an effort\nlinked to the deepest respect for the principles\nestablished in the Charter of the United Nations, in\ninternational law and in international humanitarian law.\nIn that connection, the Government of El Salvador\nwould like to express its gratitude for the efforts being\nmade by the Counter-Terrorism Committee established\nby Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). We also\nreiterate our complete readiness to cooperate in the\nunequivocal implementation of that resolution. In\naddition, we would like to inform the international\ncommunity that El Salvador will host the third session\nof the Inter-American Committee against Terrorism.\nThat meeting will be held in San Salvador during the\nfirst half of 2003. We hope the meeting will adopt\nrelevant decisions to further strengthen the hemispheric\nfight against this scourge.\nEl Salvador recognizes the progress achieved\nwith the entry into force of the Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court. In this regard, my\nGovernment is carrying out the necessary reviews to\nbring our constitutional rules in line with those of the\nStatute, so as to enable us to initiate the process of\njoining the Court.\nIn the same vein, I am also pleased to inform the\nAssembly that last week El Salvador ratified the\nInternational Convention on the Protection of the\nRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their\nFamilies, as well as the Optional Protocol to the\nConvention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of\nChildren, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography.\nIn his report on the implementation of the\nMillennium Declaration, the Secretary-General stated\nthat the world in which we live today is divided\nbetween rich and poor as never before in human\nhistory. That report also pointed out the harsh reality\nexperienced by one sixth of all human kind, which\ndaily fights to survive in a life and death struggle with\nsickness, hunger and natural and human disasters.\nMeanwhile, another sixth of mankind has attained\nlevels of well-being that would have been\nunimaginable just a few decades ago. Between both\nextremes there are the 4 billion inhabitants of\ndeveloping countries who, although we may no longer\nbe living on the verge of disaster, are very far from\nachieving the security, capacity and material well-being\nenjoyed by the developed world.\nAs a developing country, El Salvador is following\nthe course charted at Monterrey. We hope that the\noffers of funding made by various countries at the\nConference will become a reality. We are also actively\nparticipating in the preparatory work for the World\nSummit on the Information Society, as we are\nconvinced of the potential benefits that connectivity\nand knowledge will bring to the future development of\nfree societies.\nIn that sense, El Salvador shares the vision that\ninternational cooperation with medium-income\ncountries must not be exclusively limited to technical\ncooperation. That cooperation should also include\nfinancial cooperation, as the fight against poverty\nshould not be confined by borders or limited by\nstatistics pertaining to national averages. Such figures\nare far from being a true reflection of existing realities\nin different places. Our renewed democracies need to\n28\n\nbe consolidated, strengthened and made sustainable in\na way that gives everyone access to a better quality of\nlife.\nAnother of the major challenges we face, namely,\nnatural disasters, could nullify the efforts we have\nmade throughout the years. The devastating effects of\nsuch phenomena are no longer limited solely to\ntraditionally vulnerable regions. As was the case\nrecently in many European countries, other regions that\npreviously had not been very much affected by natural\ndisasters are now experiencing them. In this\nconnection, the people and the Government of El\nSalvador would like to reiterate their complete\nsolidarity with the Governments of affected countries\nand with the families that have suffered as a result of\nthe devastating floods in Europe.\nThe Government of El Salvador calls on the\ninternational community to jointly implement the\nagreements reached in the five basic areas taken up by\nthe World Summit on Sustainable Development that\ntook place recently in Johannesburg, South Africa.\nThose included water and sanitation, energy, health,\nagriculture and biological diversity. All of them are of\ncrucial importance to the future of the environment,\nparticularly in developing countries.\nAllow me to conclude by reiterating the firm\ncommitment and political will of the Government of El\nSalvador to contribute actively to the search for\ncollective and individual solutions to the problems that\nwe will take up during this session of the General\nAssembly. We also wish to reiterate our confidence in\nthe work that the Secretary-General is doing on behalf\nof the nations that make up our Organization and on the\nbasis of the purposes and principles enshrined in the\nCharter. Along with the strengthening of\nmultilateralism, those purposes and principles remain\nentirely valid in the new millennium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI greet\nyou, Your Excellency Mr. Jan Kavan of the Czech\nRepublic, President of the General Assembly, which I\naddress for the first time.\nA short distance from here, on the fateful day 11\nSeptember, 2,801 citizens of the world died. In\nColombia, violence claims the same number of victims\nevery month. Forty three million Colombians, peace-\nloving people, are experiencing one of the world's\nworst humanitarian crises. Every year Colombia buries\n34,000 of its own, victims of violence. We have lost 10\nper cent of our youth. Last year the country registered\nthe highest homicide rate in the world: 63 per 100,000\ninhabitants.\nDuring the past five years, we have experienced\n8,000 acts of collective destruction, more than those\nrecorded for any other cases of violence in the world;\n280 villages were the object of guerrilla and\n8\n\nparamilitary attacks with serious consequences for\nlocal civilians and the armed forces. The terrorist\nattack carried out during my inaugural ceremony killed\n21 ordinary people. Two million people, 40 per cent of\nthem children, have been forcibly displaced under\npressure from violent groups. That is the equivalent of\nthe simultaneous displacement of the communities of\nWashington and Manhattan. During the past five years,\n16,500 people have been kidnap victims. Yesterday, six\nchildren were kidnapped and one of them is still being\nheld.\nJust as the 11 September terrorist attacks moved\nthe entire world and triggered justified and universal\ncondemnation, mankind should be shaken by attacks\nsuch as the one carried out by guerrillas on 2 May\n2002, in Bojay\u00b7, a village of 1,000 inhabitants. They\nkilled 117 civilians who had taken refuge in the church.\nSuch violence makes our people poorer every\nday, discourages investments, hampers economic\ngrowth, diverts valuable resources and prevents us\nfrom overcoming our economic and social\nbackwardness. Violence absorbs four per cent of my\ncountry's gross domestic product. Hijackings,\nkidnappings and assaults are daily occurrences on our\nmain highways, including the one that joins our two\nlargest cities. Imagine a similar situation between\nBrussels and Paris, or New York and Boston.\nToday, Colombians are making a great effort to\naddress the problem with public order policies, State\nreform aimed at defeating corruption and political\nchicanery and greater economic growth and social\ninvestment. The main objective of our democratic\nsecurity policy is to restore the rule of law. Security is\nnot for persecuting real or imagined ideological\nenemies or maintaining a one-party regime. The aim of\ndemocratic security is to protect all citizens in a\npluralist nation, open to fraternal and creative debate.\nDemocratic security is for all Colombians and is\nintended to ensure that peasant farmers are not driven\nfrom their land; that members of the business\ncommunity are not kidnapped; that journalists are not\nthreatened; and that the missions of bishops, priests,\nnuns, preachers and educators are respected. It is also\nintended to ensure that union leaders can freely\nexercise their actions; political leaders can move about\nwithout fear; and that human rights advocates can work\nwithout threats.\nAs civilian commander-in-chief of the armed\nforces, I am committed to rigorously observing and\nrespecting human rights. Failure in this regard may\nlead to appeasement, but it would never bring\nreconciliation. Our emergency measures do not restrict\nhuman rights, but rather demand the observance of\nrules, for example with regard to the mobilization of\ncitizens, in the name of freedom of movement, to\nprevent explosives from continuing to be transported to\nassassinate people.\nWe respect debate. The security policy that is\nbeing implemented is not aimed at silencing criticism,\nbut rather at confronting violence. That policy is\nirreversible.\nThe number of military and police personnel in\nColombia is low: 3.9 per 1,000 inhabitants. New York\nhas 42,000 police officers, while all of Colombia has\n75,000. We must strengthen our armed forces. We have\ndecreed a wealth tax that will be paid by high-income\nbusinesses and citizens. The additional tax revenue\nshould amount approximately to 1 per cent of the gross\ndomestic product.\nAs part of the implementation of the democratic\nsecurity policy, our Government has called on the\nsolidarity of a million citizens to cooperate voluntarily\nwith the armed forces and justice officials. An essential\nelement of a socially oriented constitutional State is\ncitizen support for its legitimate institutions. It\nconstitutes the individual's commitment to the\ncommunity, without which the State loses its social\nnature. We must break citizen fear of the guerrillas and\nparamilitaries, and we must create community-based\nlinks with democratic institutions. To a large extent, the\nefficacy and transparency of the armed forces depend\non citizen cooperation.\nThe Colombian problem jeopardizes the\ndemocratic stability of the region. We need the world's\nassistance to resolve it. I ask for the world's help\nbecause my Government has made the decision to\ndefeat terror and to ensure that these four years do not\nend in a renewed victory for crime or in new evidence\nof State and societal vacillation before the arrogance of\nthe violent.\nIt is imperative that the sources of terror\nfinancing be eliminated. That is why we must conquer\ndrugs and kidnapping.\n9\n\nThere is concern about weapons of mass\ndestruction within the United Nations, and we share\nthat anguish. But we must understand that drugs have a\nmassive capacity for destruction, equivalent to that of\nthe most feared chemical weapons.\nWe are determined to eliminate them. We request\nthe same level of commitment from the world. We\ncannot continue with timid half-actions and decisions.\n\nWhile we delay action, more drugs are produced\nand traded by terrorism. I call on fellow members: do\nnot send us your weapons. Eliminate your markets for\ndrugs and chemical precursors. Help us with aerial\ninterdiction and drug seizures in the Pacific and in the\nCaribbean. We need resources to pay our farmers to\ndestroy drugs and work to restore our forests.\nLast week, Carlos Enrique Arenas, a 29-year-old\npilot serving with the Colombian navy  father of a\n2-year-old daughter and a second child on the way \nand his co-pilot, Roberto Enrique Guardo  the father\nof three young children  disappeared in the ocean.\nThe helicopter they were piloting crashed after\nintercepting a speedboat carrying more than two tons\nof cocaine. Sacrifices such as this demand the support\nof all nations to defeat drugs, especially since until\nnow we have only managed to seize 20 per cent of the\ndrugs that are shipped from our country.\nA United Nations resolution  Security Council\nresolution 1373 (2001)  orders the seizure of bank\naccounts, investments and other assets of individuals\nwho commit terrorist acts. That resolution has\nremained a dead letter in those countries where the\nresources that finance terrorist acts in Colombia\ncirculate.\nMy Administration's commitment to security is\nnot opposed to dialogue. Quite the contrary, we want\ndialogue. This is why we have requested the good\noffices of the United Nations through a special adviser\nof the Secretary-General. That is the way to begin a\nserious peace process, one that starts with the cessation\nof violence.\nThe United Nations Charter tells us that dialogue\nwith those who commit acts of terror is possible only if\nthose acts are halted. The pain of thousands of\nColombians caused by the kidnapping of their loved\nones  the list includes former presidential candidate\nIngrid Betancourt; several members of Congress;\nmembers of state assemblies; the Governor of my own\nstate, a former minister and tireless worker for peace;\nmembers of the armed forces, and hundreds of ordinary\npeople  demonstrates that we need humanitarian\naction that does not fuel violence but that leads us\nalong the path of reconciliation.\nThe world has plenty of analysts of Colombian\nproblems, and plenty of critics of our society and our\nsuccessive Governments. We need less rhetoric and\nmore action  that is, real contributions to solving the\nproblem. We call for effective cooperation, because the\nviolence is financed through the international drug\ntrade and is waged with weapons not made in\nColombia.\nLike other nations, we suffer dire poverty,\ninjustice, low investor confidence, high debt and a\nbudget deficit. We have always honoured and will\ncontinue always to honour our international financial\ncommitments. We are making unprecedented efforts to\nfreeze operating expenditures and to increase taxes.\nBut we need significant bilateral and multilateral\neconomic support to invest and to expand\nemployment  to begin to pay the social debt. A\nvictory over violence will trigger economic growth and\ncreate resources for social development, which in turn\nwill consolidate peace.\nOne thought: the price of a pound of Colombian\ncoffee was once more than $3; it is now around 60\ncents. International banks and cooperation agencies\nshould redouble their commitment and resources in\nColombia. The money will not to be used for wasteful\nexpenditures or to salvage bankruptcies, but will rather\nbe invested, in the interest of the poor, to ensure\ngovernability.\nThe people of Colombia are proud, hard-working,\ndemocratic and sensible; their spontaneity has not been\nstifled by their suffering. The nation has the most solid\ndemocratic tradition, widely recognized long-term\neconomic performance, a highly diversified industrial\nbase, a productive structure increasingly geared\ntowards international markets, and an enormous\npotential for small democratic enterprises.\nRepresentatives of the peoples of the world: with\nyour commitment and support, and with our own\ndetermination, Colombia will be freed from the slavery\nof violence and will be more prosperous, with greater\njustice.\n\n\n"

We are delighted that you, a\nrepresentative of our Czech neighbours, will preside\nover the General Assembly this year. I also express my\nsincere thanks to the outgoing President.\nI endorse the statement of the Danish presidency\nof the European Union.\nOne year ago, the world was shaken by the terror\nof 11 September, which was disdainful of human life.\nCivilian aircraft were transformed into guided missiles\nwhose deployment had been planned without any\nregard for human life. The devastating consequences\ndestroyed families, shattered hopes and tore people\napart, regardless of their age, gender or religious\naffiliation. Three days ago, we remembered the victims\nin a moving ceremony here in New York. We have not\nforgotten the images of 11 September; we have not\nrecovered from the shock. Our solidarity with the\nUnited States is unbroken. We understand our\nAmerican friends. Just like them, we are not prepared\nto live under the sword of Damocles that terrorism\nrepresents.\nThe murderous attack on the people and the\nAdministration of the United States was also an attack\non all open societies. Countless States mourn their\ncountrymen among the thousands of World Trade\nCenter victims. The attack could have struck any open\nsociety, but the terrorists consciously chose the United\nStates as a symbol of freedom and democracy.\nWe know that the new totalitarian challenge is\nalso directed at us all. Since 11 September 2001, the\ncommunity of nations has had to look at the question of\npeace and security at the dawn of the twenty-first\ncentury from a whole new angle. We will not be able to\nnegotiate with terrorists like Osama bin Laden. His aim\nis to kill as many innocent people as possible, thus\ncreating the maximum degree of terror and fear. If the\nterrorists succeed in acquiring weapons that are yet\nmore horrific, they will deploy them against us all\nwithout hesitation. Therefore, we must work together\nin the international coalition against terrorism to\novercome and destroy that international terrorist\nnetwork. The highly dangerous combination of\nreligious hatred, smouldering regional conflicts,\nterrorist attacks and the danger of the deployment of\nweapons of mass destruction must be prevented at any\nprice.\nBut, above all else, we must not forget: on the\none hand, terrorism must be fought resolutely by the\nmilitary and police; on the other, we need to resolve the\npolitical and social conflicts quite rightly emphasized\nin the Millennium Declaration, as they form the\nbreeding ground for the emergence of terrorism. Opting\nfor one approach and neglecting the other risks failure.\nOur common goal is for the people in our\ncountries to be able to live in safety and freedom, and\nwithout want. To achieve that, we need a system of\nglobal cooperative security that, unlike the former\nbipolarity of the cold war, includes all levels of global\npolicy relevant to security: the relations among great\n17\n\nPowers and their alliances as well as the potential\ndanger of regional crises and the threat posed by\nasymmetrical conflicts. For one thing is clearer than\never after 11 September: terrorism threatens world\npeace just as much as civil war and regional conflicts.\nSuch a system, therefore, must not be toothless, but\nrather must function in all three fields through reliable\nverification systems and enforceable sanctions\nmechanisms. I am convinced that developing such a\ncomprehensive system of global cooperative security\nwill be our central political task for the twenty-first\ncentury.\nThis problem can be solved only through\nmultilateralism \u2014 that is, if nations work together.\nTerrorism does not stop at national borders, and\nshaping globalization is a task that Governments can\nno longer tackle alone. Thus, the United Nations has a\nmajor role to play in developing this security system; it\nis the most important forum for establishing global\nrules. No other organization has comparable legitimacy\nand credibility. Decisively strengthening its ability to\nact by continuing the reform path of the Secretary-\nGeneral is, therefore, a central focus of German foreign\npolicy.\nThe developments in Iraq fill us with grave\nconcern. Saddam Hussein's regime is a brutal\ndictatorship. Under his leadership, Iraq has attacked its\nneighbours Iran and Kuwait, has fired missiles at Israel\nand has used poison gas against Iran and against its\nown Kurdish population. The regime is horrendous for\nthe Iraqi people and a risk to the region. For that\nreason, an effective containment policy and reliable\nmilitary control of the no-fly zones have been\nimplemented and a strict sanctions regime against Iraq\nhas been introduced since the Gulf War.\nThe regime in Baghdad must not own or produce\nthe means for mass destruction or the systems to\ndeliver them. Despite binding demands from the\nSecurity Council, Saddam Hussein refuses to provide\ncredible and verifiable answers to the pressing\nquestions posed by the community of nations regarding\nhis weapons of mass destruction. Therefore, the United\nNations not only must maintain the pressure on the\nIraqi Government but also must intensify it.\nWe welcome the fact that President Bush, in his\nmost recent speech, turned towards the Security\nCouncil. Even if it becomes very difficult, we must do\neverything possible to find a diplomatic solution.\nThe Security Council and Member States must\nmake it unequivocally clear to Baghdad that the\nunrestricted and unconditional re-admission of the\nweapons inspectors is the only way to avert a great\ntragedy for Iraq and the entire region. The Iraqi\nGovernment must implement all relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions in their entirety and without delay.\nWe do not, however, want any automatism\nleading to the use of military force. The fight against\ninternational terrorism remains perilous. We have not\nyet managed to fully stabilize Afghanistan. Explosive\nregional conflicts in Kashmir, the Middle East and the\nCaucasus must be resolved or at least effectively\ncontained.\nCertain central questions arise for us. Have all\neconomic and political means of pressure been truly\nexhausted? What consequences would military\nintervention have? What would it mean for regional\nstability? What effect would it have on the Middle East\nconflict? Are there new, concrete findings and facts?\nDoes the situation as assessed justify the taking of a\ngreat risk, namely, taking responsibility for peace and\nstability in the entire region for years or even decades\nto come? Would such action gain the consent of the\nArab neighbours? What consequences would it have\nfor the continuation of the global coalition against\nterrorism? In the face of these open questions, we feel\ndeep scepticism with regard to military action and thus\nhold to our approach.\nI would like to pose the further question of\nwhether a peaceful solution to the question of the\nMiddle East could not contribute considerably more to\nthe establishment of regional stability, to the successful\nfight against terrorism and to the effective control and\ndisarmament of weapons of mass destruction. In that\nway, would the regime in Baghdad not be isolated\nmuch more effectively, thus generating political\npressure for change? Would this cooperative approach\nto finding a new order for the region not be a more\npromising way to bring democracy to the Middle\nEast \u2014 one that would be supported by the regional\nPowers?\nNowhere is the connection between terrorism and\nregional conflict more obvious than in the Near and\nMiddle East. The breakthrough to peace is therefore of\nparamount importance in that region of the world. The\nconsensus among the international community of\nnations on the Middle East question is now greater than\n18\n\never. We must all pull together to achieve the goal\nenvisaged by President Bush for 2005, that of two\nStates, Israel and a democratic Palestine, living as\nneighbours within secure and recognized borders. The\nEuropean Union has devised a road map to achieve that\ngoal. An early conference on the Middle East could\nhelp to build bridges and accelerate the process.\nTogether with our European Union partners, we are\nready to make a considerable contribution in that\nrespect.\nA comprehensive peace in the Middle East must\nalso include Lebanon and Syria. Saudi Arabia's\nsignificant initiative contains the assurance that the\nArab world would then also be ready to fully normalize\nits relations with Israel.\nWithout a just and lasting solution to regional\nconflicts, we will not be able to eliminate the\nrecruitment base for terrorists and thus successfully\ncounter the asymmetrical threat. Afghanistan is an\nobvious example here. The Taliban system has\ncollapsed there and the Al Qaeda network has largely\nbeen destroyed. We are still a long way from being able\nto call the situation in the country stable and secure,\nbut progress can be noted. The implementation of the\nprovisions of the Bonn Conference agreement began\nwith the formation of a legitimate Interim\nAdministration. The process that was launched on the\nPetersberg was taken to the next level with the\nconvening in June of the emergency loya jirga. For the\nfirst time in years, the Afghan people have the chance\nto lead a life of dignity based on self-determination.\nThe people of Afghanistan will only grow in\ncourage, however, when they see and feel that the\ninternational community is also standing by its pledges\nfor the reconstruction of their country. The\ncommitments of the donor countries must materialize\nin the form of concrete projects.\nA system of global cooperative security must be\nbased on a comprehensive security concept. This must\nembrace not only military security but also the\neconomy, human rights, democracy and culture.\n\u201cTo achieve a safer world, we must create a better\nworld\u201d: that is how President Bush summed up the\nsituation in his impressive speech to the German\nBundestag last May. Shaping cooperative global\nsecurity therefore also means shaping a new global\neconomic order. Account must be taken of the needs of\nall \u2014 the developing and the developed world alike.\nResources must be more fairly distributed and poorer\ncountries must be able to participate in international\ntrade and take advantage of the opportunities of\nglobalization. This will necessitate free market access\nfor all, as well as the realization of economic and\npolitical freedoms and a just and reliable legal\nframework.\nWe must not close our eyes to the problems of\nAfrica, in particular. The food situation in the South of\nthe continent is a particular source of concern.\nCountless people are going hungry and comprehensive\nassistance is needed there. In Zimbabwe, however, the\nformer granary of Africa, a wholly irresponsible policy\nis the reason for the difficult situation. In Zimbabwe,\nhunger is caused principally not by failed harvests or\ndroughts but by self-destructive governance \u2014 a policy\nof keeping a grip on power through the suffering of the\npeople. Such a policy relies upon the fact that the\ninternational community's humanitarian conscience\nand readiness to assume responsibility will reduce the\nconsequences. We must hold this policy up against the\nbenchmarks defined by Africa itself in the framework\nof the New Partnership for Africa's Development.\nClimate and energy policy is a key component of\nthe new global economic order. The Kyoto Protocol\ncan be seen as a milestone in global climate protection.\nI am delighted that several countries have recently\nannounced plans to ratify the Protocol, and hope that\nthis will happen as soon as possible so that it can enter\ninto force. In the long term, a sensible energy policy \u2014\nand that means, above all, the promotion of renewable\nenergy sources and economical energy consumption \u2014\nis the best solution to the climate problem. Work must\ntherefore start today. Let us not forget that difficult\neconomic and ecological problems, with their social\nand humanitarian repercussions, will increasingly\nendanger stability and security too.\nThe protection of human rights must be one of the\npillars of a global security system. All efforts to secure\npeace will fail if human rights are not protected and\nmade a reality. We need a binding global set of values\nto prevent and overcome conflicts that emerge through\ninequality, injustice and the denial of freedom. Here,\ntoo, States are called upon to play a decisive and active\nrole. Moreover, we must be careful today to ensure that\nbasic human rights are not annulled under the pretext\nof combating terrorism. No one has the right to an\n\u201canti-terrorism bonus\u201d.\n19\n\nCooperative global security will have to measure\nup to the binding legal framework in which it is\nembedded. It is imperative for the globalization process\nto be flanked by a growing set of international rules,\nbecause international law and the rule of law constitute\nthe indispensable foundations for peaceful and ordered\ncoexistence. That is why the establishment of the\nInternational Criminal Court is so important to us. Its\nStatute entered into force on 1 July; Germany, along\nwith all the other members of the European Union, is\namong the 79 States to have ratified it. The Assembly\nof States Parties gave the green light this week to the\nestablishment of the Court. Next spring we will\ncelebrate its opening in The Hague. The International\nCriminal Court will start work as soon as possible and\nas efficiently as possible. But it must not be weakened\nin its work from the outset.\nMy country is applying for a non-permanent seat\non the Security Council for the period 2003-2004.\nGermany wants to play an active role in developing the\ninternational security system within the United Nations\nalong the lines that I have outlined. I would like to ask\nall members for their vote in the election on 27\nSeptember.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf\nof my country, I congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan and the\nother members of the Bureau on their election. The\nPresident can count on the full cooperation of the\ndelegation of Chile for the success of his stewardship.\nThe Government of Chile takes this opportunity\nto welcome the accession to membership of the United\nNations of the Swiss Confederation and, soon, of\nTimor-Leste. The presence of Switzerland strengthens\nits historical association with the founding principles of\nthis Organization. The upcoming presence of Timor-\nLeste symbolizes the role of the United Nations in the\ncreation of a viable and democratic State. We are proud\nto have contributed to that mission.\nOne year ago, this city suffered a reprehensible\nterrorist attack that left an indelible stain on the\nconscience of mankind. That date, 11 September 2001,\nmarked a turning point in contemporary history. This\nepisode brought us face to face with new dimensions of\nour human vulnerability, with a fragility that\nuniversalized insecurity. The attack perpetrated a few\nkilometres from this place showed us, with frightful\ncruelty, that human coexistence urgently requires new\napproaches and new instruments.\nIt has become necessary for Governments and\nsocieties to forge positive responses and to work\ntogether to resolutely confront terrorism. In a\nglobalized world, it is imperative that we re-evaluate\nmultilateralism, and Chile would like to renew its\ncommitment in that regard.\nWe believe that, at this period of history, we have\nto make every effort to bring about a safer world. That\nchallenge should unite societies and cultures. As the\nSecretary-General pointed out yesterday, the United\nNations alone has the legitimacy necessary to\ncontribute to an effective system of security.\nComplying with Security Council resolutions is a\nresponsibility incumbent upon everyone, and is\nessential to the future of the Organization.\nThe changes that have taken place in recent years\nhave created new challenges and responsibilities for\nthe world that we must assume, and to which we must\nrespond, as a global society. The risks today are indeed\nboth global and without boundaries. Both States and\nordinary men and women in every part of the world\nnow face a new environment of uncertainty. In that\ncontext, traditional notions of security  which were\nformulated against the backdrop of threats from State\nactors  have been overtaken. A safer world requires\nthat we build consensus and that we develop new\napproaches that both take into account the multi-\ndimensional nature of threats and place people at the\ncentre of their concerns.\nIn such a security scenario it is urgent that we\npromote a comprehensive focus at the global level to\ndeal with new threats and to build a world free of fear\nand poverty. The concept of human security has\nemerged from just that sort of change. We would like\npeople to be at the centre of every multilateral\ndeliberation. That was the priority that Chile put forth a\ndecade ago with its initiative to hold a summit on\nsocial development. It is that same concern that has led\nto our participation in the Human Security Network, of\nwhich Chile has been the coordinator this year.\nHuman security is linked to the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, public order and the\nsocial environment. Those elements should be\npromoted through innovative and effective strategies.\nChile's candidacy for a seat on the Security\nCouncil for the period 2003-2004  which has the\nsupport of the Group of Latin American and the\nCaribbean States, for which we once again express our\nappreciation  seeks to strengthen the multilateral\napproach to crises that threaten international peace and\nsecurity, as well as to place human security at the\ncentre of the concerns of that main body of the United\nNations.\nRespect for human rights is a fundamental\nrequirement in the search for a world that is free from\nfear, more secure and full of hope. Human rights are a\nsource of political and social legitimacy in the\ncontemporary international system and provide\nguidelines for its actions. As a member of the\n34\n\nCommission on Human Rights, our country will\nparticipate in initiatives to strengthen the fundamental\nand unique role of that body. Similarly, democracy too\nis a universal value, one which is expressed mainly\nthrough free elections and change in governance.\nStrengthening democracy requires integrity,\ntransparency and good governance. That is the proper\nway to create a democratic environment in which a\nsociety can be better integrated, protected and imbued\nwith meaning.\nMy country constructively supports and promotes\nthe spread of the values of democracy and democratic\nthinking throughout the world. In our region,\ndemocracy is a fundamental value. The adoption of the\nInter-American Democratic Charter represents a step\nforward in the continuing effort to further refine and\nstrengthen democracy. In that vein, we welcome the\nestablishment of the Community of Democracies as a\nconcerted attempt to make universal the values inherent\nin democracy.\nThe cultural dimension, as an expression of a\nmodern vision, must be part of our efforts to build a\nsafer world. Intercultural dialogue and respect for\ndiversity are fundamental elements of civilized\nrelations between nations. We believe that intercultural\ndialogue should contribute to strengthening the\nuniversal values of human dignity.\nInternational terrorism is a negation of the values\nthat make possible civilized coexistence, in which there\nmust be room for the diversity of the world. Terrorism\nis the greatest risk facing the global community in\nbuilding a safer world. Political commitment is\ntherefore needed to agree on effective efforts to\neradicate terrorism within the framework of\ninternational law. Intercultural dialogue is essential to\ndevelop a global strategy to combat terrorism. The\nUnited Nations plays an essential role as the leading\norganization in the fight against terrorism. The work of\nthe Security Council and of its Counter-Terrorism\nCommittee, established pursuant to Council resolution\n1373 (2001), and the development of a general\nconvention on international terrorism are efforts that\nwe support and to which we will continue to\ncontribute. A convention on terrorism has been adopted\nat the regional level, and we will continue to intensify\nour cooperation through the Inter-American Committee\non Terrorism and the Common Market of the South.\nThe risks and threats to global security, which are\nbeyond the effective control of States, highlight the\nnature of globalization in our world today. Indeed, the\ncharacteristics of globalization can be seen in such\nphenomena as the globalization of markets, the\nintensification of social relations and the broadening of\ncultural exchanges and communications. At the same\ntime, however, risks have also become global and the\nimbalances resulting from the unequal distribution of\nwealth have increased, thereby accentuating the trend\ntowards the marginalization and exclusion of\ncommunities, countries and regions.\nWe believe in the benefits of economic and\npolitical globalization. But we also believe that\nglobalization requires good governance and a\nsystematic and shared effort by the international\ncommunity to establish the rules of the new\ninternational system. We believe that there should be\ngreater participation in this effort, as well as ongoing\nconsultations with our citizens and our civil societies.\nThe United Nation system is an indispensable forum\nfor addressing these challenges.\nJust as we believe that the process of\nglobalization in which we are now engaged requires\nclear rules in order for its benefits to reach all of\nmankind, we also believe that the economic growth and\nprosperity of countries require freedom, democracy and\nsecurity in this global world. Chile had adopted a\nmodel that assigns to the market and to the private\nsector a key role in its development plans, within a\nframework of democracy and solidarity. We are\nconvinced that active participation in international\ntrade is a positive way of achieving growth, increasing\nemployment, being innovative in the area of\ntechnology and being effective in the allocation of\nresources.\nBased on our commitment to development with\nequity, we have opened up our economy, our\ncommunications and our culture; and we are satisfied\nat having done so. We believe, based on our\nexperience, that globalization can be a source of\nopportunity for all nations, particularly for small and\nremote countries such as ours, which are far from the\nmajor consumer centres and international flows.\nIn order for the efforts of nations such as ours to\nbe rewarded, however, it is essential for international\ntrade to be fair, to have clear-cut, established rules, and\nto avoid measures that distort it. Subsidies and lax\n35\n\nimplementation of anti-dumping measures are\nobstacles to the achievement of that goal. In this\nconnection, I wish to place special emphasis on the\nurgent need for the liberalization of the trade in\nagricultural products. Many developing countries,\nincluding my own, are highly competitive in this\nsector, but the benefits are lost because of\nprotectionism in the developed countries.\nWe argued forcefully in Doha and Monterrey that\nin order for there to be growth, there must be access to\nmarkets. As President Ricardo Lagos stated in\nMonterrey, If trade barriers were eliminated, the\ndeveloping countries would have the potential to earn\n$130 billion, more than twice the $50 billion that we\nproposed as a target for the Millennium Summit'.\nWe urge the United Nations to continue its efforts\nto promote the integrated activities of the various\nmultilateral political, economic and financial agencies\nthat are helping to achieve a world of greater\ndevelopment, equity and security.\nAs the multilateral system continues to develop\nculturally, socially and politically, Chile will continue\nto promote the mainstreaming of the gender\nperspective into the various activities of the\ninternational system and its subsystems. We also\nsupport the creation of opportunities for participation\nby civil society organizations.\nThe more developed, more equitable and safer\nworld to which we aspire also requires us to establish\ninternational standards for the protection of the rights\nof vulnerable groups. Chile will continue to encourage\nthe conclusion of agreements that contribute to the\nformulation and improvement of public policies in this\nfield. I would like to underscore our political\ncommitment to achieving a comprehensive convention\nthat protects and promotes the rights and dignity of\npeople with disabilities. Integration, recognition of the\ndignity of people and equality of opportunity for all are\nthe basic precepts of a more secure society.\nWe are convinced that we need to commit\nourselves as an international community to more active\npolicies for the protection of the environment. Few\nissues on the international agenda affect us all equally\nas much as this one and, paradoxically, few generate as\nmany disputes. The Johannesburg Summit confirmed\nmy belief that we must work towards consensus on\nbasic concepts.\nThe right to live in a socially acceptable\nenvironment is an ethical imperative of the present day.\nWe must therefore give priority to a global\nenvironmental agenda that focuses on improving legal\nnorms relating to, and providing better protection for,\nthe oceans, the climate, the atmosphere and the ozone\nlayer.\nGiven the direct impact that this issue has on\ndevelopment, I wish to note that, in December 2003, at\nConcepci\u00dbn, Chile, the World Biotechnology Forum\nwill take place under the sponsorship of the United\nNations Industrial Development Organization and the\nGovernment of Chile.\nWith regard to the political dimension, which\nemphasizes security, human rights, democracy and the\nfight against terrorism, I would like to refer to certain\nareas of the world that are of greatest concern to the\ninternational community. Latin America is a region in\nwhich democracy is the norm, even though in some\ncases it is fragile. The nations of our continent have\nlearned how difficult it is to build and sustain\ndemocratic institutions based on universal principles\nand values. We have a number of regional and\nsubregional mechanisms that compel us to fulfil this\nobligation. The Rio Group is without doubt the most\nimportant of these.\nThe world is aware of the current economic crisis\nin our region. This is a paradoxical situation. Latin\nAmerica responded properly to the challenge and\nadopted many of the structural economic reforms that\nwere asked of it, which led to a degree of liberalization\nwithout precedent in its history. The developed world,\nhowever, is sending contradictory signals that test the\nfaith of those of us who view globalization and the\nsystem of free trade as the basis for the development of\nour peoples. Those of us who believe that globalization\nmust be based on the principles of competitiveness\nwithout exclusion thus see, on a regular basis,\nrestrictions placed on our products; these are very\ndifficult to explain. This casts doubt on the existence of\na desire to move towards a globalization without\ncompartmentalization.\nBecause of its gravity, I must refer to a conflict\nthat affects the entire international community. Chile\nwishes to express its deep concern at the grave\nsituation in the Middle East in the light of the impasse\nin the peace negotiations aimed at finding a solution to\nthe crisis between Palestinians and Israelis. The\n36\n\ncontinuing escalation of the violence that began in the\nregion on 28 September 2000 continues to claim many\nvictims and to cause heavy material damage, and\nthreatens to spread throughout the region, thereby\nposing a serious danger to international peace and\nsecurity.\nThe Government of Chile reiterates the need for\nthe strict implementation of the relevant resolutions of\nthe Security Council and recourse to constructive\nnegotiation, with a view to achieving a just,\ncomprehensive and lasting peace that make possible\nthe creation of a viable Palestinian State and\ncoexistence with the State of Israel within secure and\ninternationally recognized borders. A world in which\nPalestinians and Israelis can live together will be a\nmore secure world.\nWe share the international sense of urgency that\nthe Government of Iraq must abide by the provisions of\nSecurity Council resolutions in the interest of regional\nand global security. We are convinced that in this\nglobalized world it is essential for us to act in\naccordance with the principles and values promoted by\nthe United Nations.\nIn Africa we now see signs of hope. Chile wishes\nto express its firm support for the African continent in\nits decision to create modern regional instruments, such\nas the African Union and the New Partnership for\nAfrica's Development. We hope that these initiatives,\nto which Africans themselves have referred to as the\nAfrican renaissance, will generate in the international\ncommunity a response commensurate with those\nefforts. This is a new challenge for the twenty-first\ncentury, and the United Nations must be involved.\nChile, a small nation that looks out at the world\nfrom the South, has developed important links of\ninternational solidarity in the most diverse\ndirections  in Latin America as part of the inter-\nAmerican system; in its association with the European\nUnion; and as a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic\nCooperation organization. In opting for open\nmultilateralism, we are facing today's challenge of\nworking towards a more secure world  a world free\nfrom fear and poverty. We will encounter obstacles\nwhich we must confront with shared political resolve.\nThis is the responsibility of all the countries\nrepresented here today in the General Assembly.\nLet us advance towards global human security.\nLet us combat terrorism, poverty and misery in the\nsearch for a more democratic and more tolerant society.\nIn this challenge, Chile is convinced that\nmultilateralism can and must contribute to overcoming\nthe insecurity currently prevailing in the world. The\nUnited Nations offers such an opportunity to the\ninternational community. It is a forum that can and\nmust seek consensual solutions to the inescapable\nproblems now plaguing humankind.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAs I\noffer you my congratulations upon your assumption of\nyour high office, Mr. President, I must also praise your\n6\n\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo, for a\ntruly exemplary term as President, which was marked\nat the outset by the Nobel Peace Prize for the\nOrganization and which closed with the promise of the\nrecently concluded World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment. Together with the continuing leadership\nof Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the support of the\nOrganization's Member States, I look forward to that\ntradition of excellence and achievement continuing\nunder your presidency, Sir.\nI add my voice to the chorus within this\nAssembly warmly welcoming the Swiss Confederation\nto our fold and congratulating East Timor on its\nforthcoming accession to membership. Tonga very\nmuch looks forward to working with both of them as\nfully-fledged States Members of the Organization.\nWhile 11 September 2001 will for all of us be\never present, it is fitting that we pause to remember\nthose who fell in the line of duty and those other loved\nones who perished on that terrible day. Those horrific\nevents should serve to inspire us to rededicate\nourselves and galvanize our collective efforts to fight\nthe scourge of terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations.\nMy Government continues to formulate measures\nin compliance with Security Council resolution 1373\n(2001). These measures have both national and\nregional dimensions, and a number of workshops have\nbeen held in the Pacific region during the year to\nensure that Pacific island countries formulate viable\ncounter-terrorism measures and to assist them to do so.\nA number of key Government agencies, including civil\naviation, immigration, police, finance and customs\nagencies, have already adopted measures, including\nfinancial and rapid reaction security measures, to\ntighten the security aspect of the resolution. Obviously,\nthe sustained assistance of developed countries in our\nregion has been very useful in our endeavours. It is our\nearnest hope that our required country report will be\nbefore the Counter-Terrorism Committee by the year's\nend. In this respect, I am grateful to the Committee and\nto the Security Council for their patience.\nSince I last addressed this Assembly, at the\nMillennium Summit, there have been further signposts\nto add to the developmental path. These are signposts\nso readily identifiable as Doha, Monterrey and, now,\nJohannesburg. These names epitomize the vision and\nthe as yet unfulfilled promise of our collective\ndevelopment aspirations in this era of globalization. In\nthat regard, I commend President Fox and the people of\nMexico for their sterling efforts earlier this year. It was\npleasing that consensus prevailed on critical thematic\nissues of particular import to developing countries, and\nwe look forward to the opportunities that Monterrey\nwill afford. I further commend President Mbeki and the\npeople of South Africa for their wonderful achievement\nearlier this month. I am particularly pleased that the\nJohannesburg Summit gave prominence and profile in\nthe Plan of Implementation to the sustainable\ndevelopment of small island developing States. In that\nregard, Tonga looks forward to the 10-year review of\nthe Barbados Programme of Action in 2004 as a further\nsignpost in the developmental path that will give\nimpetus to what was achieved in Johannesburg. In\npreparing for that review, Tonga will continue its\nnational efforts to refine and identify areas for specific\npriority capacity-building needs, as well as\nopportunities to take increased advantage of financial\nand technological support.\nAs a developing ocean State, we are encouraged\nby the particular commitments in the Johannesburg\nPlan of Implementation on fish stocks and fishing\npractices. The implementation of those time-bound\ncommitments requires responsibility and good faith\nfrom all parties so as to ensure that States like mine\nobtain their fair share of their vastest and most\nbountiful resource. We are pleased that the United\nNations fish stocks Agreement has entered into force\nand welcome the informal meeting of States parties\nthat took place here in New York recently. In this\nrespect, we urge other Member States to become party\nto that important Agreement. Within this context, we\nalso continue to welcome the preparations under way\nfor giving effect to the Convention on the Conservation\nand Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in\nthe Western and Central Pacific Ocean. The\nConvention is a testament to our commitment to\nconserving and sustainably managing a critically\nimportant resource. As such, we continue to urge the\ndistant water fishing nations with a real fisheries\ninterest in our region to make every effort to become a\nparty to the Convention. Tonga continues to value the\nwork and decisions taken this year of the Meeting of\nStates Parties to the United Convention on the Law of\nthe Sea, the International Seabed Authority and the\nthird meeting of the United Nations Open-ended\nInformal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law\nof the Sea. We look forward to an important milestone\n7\n\nlater this year: the twentieth anniversary of the United\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. I hope that\nMember States will consider the upcoming anniversary\nas an opportune time to become a party to the\nConvention.\nOur region has further endorsed a first-ever\nregional oceans policy that elaborates some guiding\nprinciples that should serve as a template for countries\nlike Tonga to consider using to developing national\nocean policies that strengthen coordination and\ncomplementarity in our ocean-related activities. One\nactivity that continues to give rise to deep concern is\nthe transshipment of radioactive material through the\nwaters of our region. In this regard, while we might\nunderstand the needs and requirements of those States\nthat engage in this activity, it is just as important that\nthe necessary framework for prior notice, consent,\nsafety and compensation for countries like Tonga not\nbe ignored.\nTonga continues to support the development of an\nappropriate environmental vulnerability index for small\nisland developing States and commends the continuing\nwork of the South Pacific Applied Geoscience\nCommission in that regard. It is our belief that, with\nthe participation of States, such an index has the\npotential to provide accurate indicators of vulnerability\nto which small islands in particular are exposed, such\nas natural disasters, climate change and sea level rise.\nAs such, Tonga welcomes the commitment by certain\nAnnex I countries under the Kyoto Protocol made\nduring the Johannesburg Summit to ratify the Protocol\nand the further opportunities for progress that such\npositive action presents.\nOn 30 and 31 December 2001, tropical cyclone\nWaka traversed the northern group of Tonga with a\nwind velocity in excess of 100 miles an hour and\nresulted in substantial and horrific damage to those\nislands. To be sure, the damage was estimated at over\n140 million Tongan dollars, but thankfully there was no\nloss of life. The inevitable and difficult task of relief,\nrecovery and reconstruction was compounded by the\ngeographic distance from the capital of the northern\ngroup and the sheer scale of the damage sustained.\nLuckily, action by traditional donor Governments and\nour neighbours within the region, territorial\ngovernments, regional and international organizations,\nsuch as the Pacific Islands Forum and specific United\nNations agencies, was swift and generous and provided\nmuch-needed assistance to my Government. I am\ndeeply grateful to those Governments, organizations\nand agencies, as well as to non-governmental\norganizations and churches, for their valued assistance\nin our time of crisis. Two weeks after the cyclone,\nnature, having wrought such devastating winds, caused\nmore favourable weather to prevail, which greatly\nhelped the replanting phases of recovery. We expect a\nresurgence of the critical agricultural, tourism and\nfisheries sectors by the end of the year.\nWhile information and communications\ntechnology (ICT) remains the way to go, we continue\nwith our own efforts to bridge the digital divide and\ntake maximum advantage of the digital revolution. To\ndo so will require joint efforts in tandem with the\ninternational community and the United Nations,\nparticularly through the efforts of the United Nations\nICT Task Force as one avenue. Such efforts must be\ncharacterized by partnership and inclusion in the ICT\nprocess, so that all developing States in every region\ncan benefit. The United Nations role of bridging,\ncoordinating and integrating activities is therefore\ncrucial. In that respect, we urge continued support for\nthe Small Island Developing States Information\nNetwork (SIDSNet) and for efforts to strengthen its\ncapacity to support and assist small island developing\nStates.\nWe welcome the fruitful outcome earlier this year\nof the General Assembly special session on children.\nWhile we recognize the promise it holds for the welfare\nand well-being of all children, like the outcome of the\nrecent special session on HIV/AIDS, commitments\nmust progress beyond rhetoric into concrete action.\nTonga fully supports the work of the Security\nCouncil and, like other speakers before me, calls for\nthe full implementation of all of its resolutions to\nensure an enduring peace in arenas of conflict and to\nlift the veil of doubt where such doubt could lead to\nconflict.\nIn one such arena, we join the call for an end to\nviolence, a return to the negotiating table and the\nbuilding of confidence so as to realize the coexistence\nof two States, side by side in secure and recognized\nborders.\nTonga also supports efforts to streamline the work\nof the General Assembly so that it can play the pivotal\nand focused role we desire. In like terms, we support\nthe call for reform of the Security Council, in which\nthe number of both permanent and non-permanent seats\n8\n\nwould be increased to accord with and respond to\ntoday's realities.\nFinally, with respect to pertinent regional issues,\nTonga endorses the views expressed in both the Nadi\nDeclaration, contained in document A/56/1015, and the\nSuva Communiqu\u00e9, that will be contained in document\nA/57/331. They are the respective outcomes of the\nthird Summit of the African, Caribbean and Pacific\nHeads of State and Government, held in Nadi, Fiji, in\nJuly 2002, and of the annual meeting of the Pacific\nIslands Forum Leaders held in Suva, Fiji, in August\n2002.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, I would like to\nexpress my thanks to Mr. Han Seung-soo, President of\nthe previous session of the General Assembly. We\nappreciated his skilful guidance and leadership. We\nwish you, Sir, as incoming President, a year of\nconstructive dialogue and fruitful cooperation.\nI also would like to take this opportunity to\nwelcome Switzerland and East Timor, which are\njoining the United Nations family. This expansion of\nUnited Nations membership is very important. It is\ntaking place at a time when the need for global\nsolidarity and partnership is greater than ever before.\nTerrorism threatens global stability and the very basis\nof our lives. Our countries must stand united and act\ntogether in order to avert threats to our existence and\nsecure the future of our children.\nMy country knows from experience how powerful\nand instrumental solidarity can be. Some years ago,\nLithuania and eight other countries of Central and\nEastern Europe formed an informal Vilnius Group,\nwhich has now grown to 10 members, to facilitate their\naccession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO). Solidarity and mutual support are helping us\nto make these aspirations a reality that is within our\ngrasps. We hope that our countries will soon join the\nEuropean Union and NATO, thus reinforcing common\nvalues in the region as well as our common positions\nand actions in the face of future challenges and threats.\nBut political solidarity is not enough. Our\ncountries have also launched regional initiatives and\ntaken other concrete steps to increase contributions to\nthe global campaign against terrorism. In particular, I\nwould like to mention the conference against\nterrorism \u2014 a Polish initiative \u2014 that was held in\nWarsaw last November. Our countries are determined\nto act and cooperate further, thus strengthening\nEuropean and global security.\nIn the face of common threats, solidarity must\nemerge as a consolidating driving force in global\ndiplomacy. The tragedy of 11 September was an\nexperience that reinforced and strengthened our\ncommon resolve to combat and counter terrorism. It\nshould give us the courage and determination to work\ntogether as an international community in addressing\nthe roots of terrorism; in responding decisively to non-\ncompliance with Security Council resolutions and to\ngross violations of internationally recognized norms\nand behaviour; in fighting terror worldwide; and in\nkeeping weapons of mass destruction out of the hands\nof terrorists.\nIt is regrettable, therefore, that a Member of this\ngreat body, the United Nations, does not uphold its\ncommitments or the underlying principles of this\nOrganization. The Iraqi regime must allow unrestricted\naccess to United Nations inspectors so that they can\nresume their work. We should exert all possible\npressure to ensure this. Indeed, this is a test case with\nrespect to the international community's solidarity and\nunity.\n22\n\nLast but not least, I would like to underscore the\nimportance of international and regional cooperation in\nnon-proliferation and arms control. It has always been\nLithuania's firm policy to take part in all relevant,\neffective and functional multilateral arms control and\nconfidence-building regimes that are open to us and\nthat correspond to our national security interests. This\nyear, Lithuania has applied for membership in the\nTreaty on Open Skies. We will also seek to join the\nadapted Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in\nEurope after it comes into force and is open to all\nEuropean democracies.\nEach and every State Member of the United\nNations should make a positive contribution to\ninternational security and stability, first and foremost\nby respecting the rule of law and the human rights of\nits citizens. Good governance is a good starting point\nfor all of us, irrespective of our cultural diversity or\nfundamental differences of history and geography.\nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who\ndevoted much time to the planning of this multilateral\ninstitution known as the United Nations, once said,\n\u201cWe have learned that we cannot live alone, at peace;\nthat our own well-being is dependent on the well-being\nof other nations far away.\u201d Thus, the real strength of\nour power as an international community continues to\nlie in the power of our resolve to deal with the critical\nissues.\nYesterday in this great city of New York, we paid\nour respects to the victims of 11 September 2001. We\nadmire the way the American people have gone\nthrough this tragedy, and we support the United States\nof America in its efforts to eliminate threats to\ninternational security and human freedom. Let us\ndebate, talk things out and make full use of diplomatic\nmeasures. But we must be ready to act decisively when\nstrategic realities demand defence of freedom and\ndemocracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt was 10 years ago,\nimmediately following the admission of newborn\nSlovenia to the United Nations, that I addressed the\nAssembly for the first time. I did so with great pride,\nwith faith in the United Nations and with gratitude for\nthe chance given to my country to present to the\ninternational community its own views on current\nworld affairs, with a sense of responsibility for its\nactions not only towards its own citizens, but also\ntowards the entire international democratic community.\nLooking back at the past decade, I can say\nwithout the slightest reservation that, without the\nUnited Nations, life on our planet would be even more\nuncertain, social injustice would be even more\nwidespread and global disparities in prosperity even\nmore marked. There would be even more systematic\nviolations of human rights in many States and even\nmore wars.\nIn spite of its acknowledged weaknesses and\ninefficiencies, this world Organization has done great\nwork. I daresay that, throughout its membership,\nSlovenia, too, has contributed to this through its own\nactive pursuit of the principles of the United Nations. It\nreceived widespread recognition for the work it\naccomplished as a non-permanent member of the\nSecurity Council; this is something of which we are\nparticularly proud.\n2\n\nThe United Nations decisions at the historic\nMillennium Summit have already placed the\nOrganization in the future realm of our global world.\nThe violence committed by States against their own\npeoples is now faced with a new force: the ethic of the\ndemocratic world. This ethic does not recognize\nabsolute State sovereignty or absolute non-interference\nin internal affairs when systematic mass violations of\nhuman rights, through State terror, occur.\nThe principle of humanitarian intervention is the\nbeginning of an important process of implementing\nglobal ethics in the governance of this globalized and\nincreasingly interdependent world. It is also a clear\nmessage to the authors of international law and to\ninternational judicial institutions. It is one of the pillars\nof the next phase of international law, as is the\nInternational Criminal Court. No one any longer has\nresponsibility only towards themselves. State\nsovereignty is no longer untouchable. Everyone, in\ntheir actions, also has a responsibility towards global\nsociety, for in an increasingly integrated world, the\nactions of one easily affect others.\nCertain measures of the global community of\nStates in response to the challenges of the twenty-first\ncentury, such as the special session on the future of\nchildren, the World Summit Sustainable Development\nand the forthcoming meetings on a better future for\nAfrica are signs that the United Nations is gaining in\npolitical and moral clout as an Organization common to\nall States and as an organization capable of finding the\nstrength to carry out the announced internal reforms.\nIn that context, Slovenia supports the\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration and the\nSecretary-General's proposed reforms. That these\nefforts are urgently needed became particularly\napparent last year on 11 September, a day of tragedy\nnot only for New York, Washington and the United\nStates in general, but for all humanity. The entire\ndemocratic world joined in the fight against\ninternational terrorism. Slovenia also did so with great\nresolve. No one who cared for humanity just stood\naside.\nBut as time passed, it became increasingly clear\nthat even the best military weaponry of the anti-\nterrorist coalition could not reach down to the social\nroots of this horrendous evil. This evil is craftily taking\nadvantage of the apathy and the anger of people and\nStates without a future. This evil is trying to regain its\nstrength by playing on religious, cultural and\ncivilizational differences, intertwined with the great\nsocial rifts in our global world. Evil, understood in this\nway  an evil that threatens to use the most atrocious\nweapons of mass destruction  can be eradicated only\nthrough concerted action by democratic States under\nthe umbrella of the United Nations.\nIt is precisely in this context that the authority\nand credibility of the United Nations are on trial. The\nOrganization has proven itself capable of reaching\ncommon positions and decisions even on the most\ndemanding issues. We are capable of defining common\npositions, even concerning the actions of those who do\nnot respect these common decisions. The United\nNations now must have the ability not only to speak of\nthose positions, but also to implement them through\nconcerted action. That is the responsibility that all of us\nface today.\nGlobalization, with all of its positive and negative\naspects, is a given fact. Let us do more to transform\nthat fact into something that is in keeping with the\nneeds of the people and the rule of individual and\ncollective human rights. Certainly, this cannot be\nachieved by trying to drive peoples, States, cultures,\nreligions and civilizations away from their own\nidentities, by trying to place them under the common\ndenominator of a single global identity. That would\nsignify the collapse of our human world, bearing\ndisastrous consequences. Today's world, where borders\nbetween States  and particularly between\ncivilizations  are growing less rigid, is a world full of\nplural identities and of clearly defined national,\ncultural and religious entities that are beginning to\nopen up to one another.\nThis plurality calls for a unique integrating factor.\nThat factor can only be a global ethic based on the\nancient principle of reciprocity among human beings:\ndo unto others as you would have others do unto you.\nIn times of interdependence among each and every one\nof us, such values are particularly important. The\nglobal ethic should be developed based on this value,\nfor it is a value with deep roots in the world's age-old\ngreat religions and civilizations. Based on this value,\nwe will be able to strengthen universal human rights\nand global social justice, and without that justice, one\ncannot expect the world to be a safe and peaceful place\noffering people justified hope that our planet belongs to\nall of humanity.\n3\n\nInternational terrorism has unveiled the negative\naspects of interdependence among our societies. We\nmust now do more to strengthen the positive aspects\nand to create new ones. The environmental, economic\nand ethical challenges humanity is facing today require\na radical rethinking of global governance and the\nestablishment of global responsibility. This is so much\nmore so since we are faced with the breakdown of\nregulation and control in global trade, with an\ninequitable global development machinery that\ngenerates misery and humiliation, and that manifests a\nrelentless preference for economic and financial logic\nover ecological, social and human demands. A positive\nalternative must be found to these negative aspects of\nour interdependence.\nPresent generations of statesmen, politicians,\nacademicians and civil society all have a duty to lay the\nfoundations of a global ethic and a United Nations that\noffers stronger guarantees for a world that is no longer\nso fiercely divided into peoples, nations and States\nwith the right to a future and those who are robbed of\nthat future by the technological and social gaps of our\nplanet.\nI am convinced that there will be a kinder future\nfor our world and a more creative future for the United\nNations. It is with this in mind that I most warmly\nwelcome our new Member, Switzerland, and soon also,\nTimor-Leste. These two new Members illustrate very\nclearly all the disparities in our globalized world. I\nfirmly believe that their work in this Assembly will\nhelp transform the United Nations into a community\nfor the entire world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to the\npresidency of the fifty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly of the United Nations. We are confident that\nyou will conduct the proceedings of this session with\ngreat competence, thanks to your outstanding skills and\nqualities.\nI should like to pay tribute also to your\npredecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, who presided ably\nover the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\nLet me also express my deep appreciation for the\nefforts of the Secretary-General to harmonize\ninternational relations and to ensure respect for the\nprinciples of the Charter with a view to strengthening\ninternational peace and security.\nI wish also to welcome Switzerland and Timor-\nLeste to the United Nations.\n31\n\nWe have agreed to the American political\ninitiative that was put forward in 1991. At the Madrid\nConference, several agreements were entered into by\nthe Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO),\nrepresenting the Palestinian people, and Israel. The aim\nof those agreements was the commencement of\nnegotiations between the two parties with a view to the\nimplementation of Security Council resolutions 242\n(1967) and 338 (1973). They also called on Israel to\nwithdraw from the Arab territories occupied since\n1967.\nA deadline of five years was set for those\nnegotiations. The clock began to run after the signing\nof the Oslo Accords in 1993 in Washington, under the\nauspices of the previous United States President \nPresident Clinton.\nHowever, successive Israeli Governments have\nrefused to withdraw from the occupied Palestinian\nterritories and have continued to deploy Israeli forces\nthere. This intransigence on the part of Israel highlights\nits goal: the continued occupation of Palestinian\nterritories.\nDuring the course of those negotiations, new\nsettlements were built, 187 altogether, inhabited by\nsome 370,000 settlers, most of them armed. Recently,\nIsrael began building a wall along the line of the 1967\ntruce. Israel is continuing its cruel and barbaric acts\nand carrying out its scorched-earth policy, with a view\nto depriving the Palestinian people of their income and\nmeans of subsistence. During the past two years of\nconflict, agricultural production has dropped by 80 per\ncent and industrial production by 60 per cent.\nUnemployment has reached 65 per cent, and 63 per\ncent of the population is living in poverty.\nIsrael has destroyed public institutions, police\nstations, ports and airports. More than 1,350 houses\nhave been torn down, and more than 3,000 businesses\nand industrial concerns in the occupied territories and\nin Gaza have been demolished, an area of 5,800 square\nkilometres.\nThe taxes that Israel collects, about $850 million,\nwhich should have been paid to the Palestinian\nAuthority, have been kept by the Israelis. A total of\n90,000 olive trees, out of 300,000, have been uprooted,\nand the Palestinian infrastructure has been demolished.\nThe occupied territories were divided into 227 separate\ncantons. Trade was halted, measures were taken to\ncurtail the freedom of movement of people and of\ngoods, and borders with Arab countries were closed. In\naddition, the Israeli authorities have placed President\nArafat under house arrest.\nThese arbitrary measures have prompted the\nPalestinian people to pursue their heroic resistance, in\nthe face of Israel's various lethal weapons, which are\nused to enforce the separation between the cantons. In\nBethlehem, in Gaza and in other cities, residential areas\nhave been bombed. Moreover, many Palestinians have\nbeen thrown into jail.\nThe fact-finding team set up by the Security\nCouncil was prevented from going into the field to\nwitness firsthand the suffering of the Palestinian people\nat the hands of the Nazi Israeli occupation.\nThe United States is a great Power and bears an\nimportant responsibility vis-\u2021-vis the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security and the prevention of\nregional conflict. Moreover, the United States has\ncommitted itself to working with the former Soviet\nUnion, through the United Nations, to resolve conflicts\nby peaceful means and to eliminate their arsenals of\nweapons of mass destruction.\nThis is a very important approach that enables the\nUnited Nations to enhance fruitful international\ncooperation among States. Should that approach be\nabandoned, the United Nations will fail to develop\ninternational cooperation and to maintain international\npeace and security. The use of force in the context of\nintra-State relations to resolve problems does not help\nus in any way to uphold the purposes and principles of\nthe United Nations. On the contrary; it only gives rise\nto fear and doubt among the States Members of the\nUnited Nations, especially developing countries, which\nhave always turned to the Organization to protect them.\nThe peoples of the world are looking to the\nUnited States in the hope that that major Power will\nplay a positive and neutral role in international\nrelations and in the hope that it will always be a source\nof technological and economic assistance.\nIt goes without saying that the commitment of the\nUnited States to the strict implementation of United\nNations resolutions  in particular those of the\nSecurity Council  without the use of a double\nstandard strengthens our trust in the United Nations\nand reinforces its credibility as a forum for the\nresolution of international problems.\n32\n\nThus we are justified in asking ourselves whether\nthese humanitarian and political responsibilities are\nincumbent on the United States in this era of\nglobalization. We might ask ourselves why the United\nStates is threatening to use force against Iraq, when\nsanctions have been imposed on that country for more\nthan 10 years.\nWhy does the United States not speak of the\nelimination of the weapons of mass destruction\npossessed by Israel, which threaten the Arab States, as\nwas noted previously? Israel could destroy the\nEgyptian high dam, even though a peace agreement\nwas signed between Israel and Egypt more than 24\nyears ago. Mr. Hans Blix has stated that he had no\nevidence that Iraq had any weapons of mass\ndestruction.\nWhen the political negotiations began, the Arab\ncountries took a neutral position. Israeli Prime\nMinisters Rabin and Peres visited certain Arab States\nand an attempt was made to normalize Israeli-Arab\nrelations. When Yitzhak Rabin was killed in 1995 and\nauthority was handed over to Mr. Netanyahu, progress\ntowards peace was impeded. The Arab countries halted\nthe process of normalizing relations with Israel.\nNevertheless, at the 1996 Arab Summit they said that\npeace was an Arab strategy that would not be\nabandoned. Despite five years of negotiations between\nIsraelis and Palestinians, however, expectations were\nnot fulfilled.\nGreat sacrifices were made on our part. During\nthe Camp David summit, an aide to President Clinton\ndenied that Barak wanted to give the Palestinians a\nlarge part of Palestinian territory. Israel was to keep 10\nper cent of the territory along the Jordanian border,\nwith three early-warning systems in the West Bank and\nthe establishment of a mutilated Palestinian State with\nno sovereignty.\nThe events of 11 September 2001 led to a\nhumanitarian catastrophe that shook the conscience of\nthe world. All countries of the world, including Arab\nand Muslim countries, stood in solidarity with the\nAmerican people and expressed their intention to\ncombat terrorism in all its forms. We were surprised,\nhowever, that the United States Administration refused\nto acknowledge that the Sharon Government was\nperpetrating acts of State terrorism. The Arabs put\nforward a political initiative at the Arab Summit in\nMarch, in the hope that they would be able to make an\neffective contribution to ending the Arab-Israeli\nconflict with a view to ratifying a peace agreement\nwith Israel. This Arab initiative, which provided for a\nwithdrawal by Israel from lands occupied since 1967\nand the establishment of a Palestinian State with Al-\nQuds as its capital, was endorsed and welcomed by the\nUnited States and the European States. It is not enough,\nhowever, to merely welcome the initiative. We believe\nthat implementing it would make a political settlement\npossible. Expressions of compassion and sympathy are\nwelcome but they must be supported by concrete\nactions if a settlement is to be achieved. The Arab\ninitiative includes all the essential principles necessary\nfor a settlement, in accordance with the provisions of\nthe Madrid Agreement and the principle of land for\npeace.\nSecurity Council resolution 1397 (2002) went\neven further in supporting the establishment of a\nPalestinian State that would be recognized by Israel.\nThis was accompanied by an American proposal. If\nIsrael rejects this comprehensive and fair proposal,\nhow much longer can it expect to continue in this\nclimate of animosity towards Arabs and constant\nthreats to their security? How long can Israel continue\nto occupy Arab territory and prevent Palestinian\nrefugees from returning home? The question of\nPalestine cannot be separated from the situation of the\nArab States, given all that the issue represents for them\nand for their future.\nIsrael must end the acts of aggression that it\ncontinues to perpetrate against Palestinians and their\ntowns. The Israeli army is continuing to assassinate\ncivilians and police and security officers. Sharon has\nbeen described as a man of peace, and it has been said\nthat Israel has a right to self-defence, even as it\ncontinues to occupy Arab territories and commit\nmassacres. The situation on the ground defies the\nimagination; it is very difficult to find a way to justify\nthe American policy. If the threat of terrorism is\nallowed to rule our lives, the world will become a\nbattlefield.\nIn conclusion, we and the other Arab countries\nwelcomed the American statement on the establishment\nof a Palestinian State. We reaffirm, however, that the\nborders of that State should be based on the\ndemarcation line of 4 June 1967, in accordance with\nCouncil resolutions. Its sovereignty must be assured,\nand Israeli forces must be withdrawn from all the\nterritory. We cannot agree to any temporary borders.\n33\n\nWe want a lasting settlement in keeping with the Arab\ninitiative put forward by Prince Abdullah of Saudi\nArabia  an initiative that is in keeping with relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions and with the principles of\nthe peace process.\nWe appreciate the role that the Quartet is playing\nin the peace process. No party should call upon the\nPalestinians alone to meet their demands. The Israeli\nforces must be called upon to revise their strategy and\nthe Israeli side must end its assassinations and attacks\nagainst citizens and refrain from using collective\neconomic sanctions, occupation and terrorism as a tool.\nIsrael must halt its ongoing assault, lift the siege\nthat has been imposed upon the Palestinian people and\nwithdraw completely from the occupied territories so\nthat the Palestinian Authority can implement the\npromised reforms and hold elections in the West Bank\nand Gaza, as well as in Al-Quds, under international\nauspices. There should be an international presence to\nguarantee the protection of the Palestinian people. This\nis a matter of urgency; the siege that is impeding the\ndaily life of our citizens must be lifted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The best wishes of the Peruvian people\nand their Government go also to the delegations\ngathered here for an event that coincides with our\n12\n\ncommemoration of the sad moments that one year ago\nput to the test the feelings and solidarity of humankind.\nHuman beings cannot and must not, either as\nindividuals or as a species, cease their efforts to make\nhistory rational. Because it is that effort to give a sense\nof freedom and justice to collective living that alone\ncan humanize life.\nAs President of Peru I reaffirm from this rostrum\nthe commitment of the Government and the people of\nPeru to the international community to fight resolutely\nin favour of democracy and international security,\nwhich my country considers fundamental to human\ndevelopment.\nThe world has put an enormous challenge before\nus, the challenge of globalizing security. Without that\nsecurity our economies cannot grow and our nations\ncannot develop socially, for it is clear that global\ninsecurity conspires against the poor.\nFor that same reason, and driven by our\ndemocratic convictions, I wish to reaffirm here,\nwithout ambiguity, my firm condemnation of the\ninsanity of the terrorist attacks perpetrated against the\npeople of the United States on 11 September 2001, and\nto reaffirm the solidarity of the Peruvian people and\nGovernment to our friend the United States of\nAmerica. My Government will continue to support the\ninternational community's efforts to confront, always\nwithin the framework of international law, the cruel\nand irrational ravages of international terrorism.\nIn that regard, Peru pledges before this Assembly\nto continue to cooperate with the Security Council's\nCounter-Terrorism Committee by making available the\nexperts it needs in order to counter with intelligence\nand resolve the threats and acts of international\nterrorism, consistent with the principles of the Charter\nof the United Nations and Security Council resolutions.\nWe are convinced that our nations must weave a\nvast network of commitments if we are to cooperate\neffectively in all fields in order to defeat terrorism.\nPeace, democracy and human rights, along with\nfreedom of expression, are the concepts that must be\ngiven priority in the process of globalization. And to\nthat end, Peru supports every effort to reach a\nconsensus in the negotiation of a draft comprehensive\nconvention against terrorism.\nPeru is a party to 12 United Nations conventions\nwhich relate to the fight against terrorism and, in that\nregard, we call upon those States that have not yet done\nso to sign and ratify these conventions. I refer in\nparticular to the International Convention for the\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism and the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of\nTerrorist Bombings. That would be a decisive step\ntowards the eradication of this scourge, which threatens\npeace, security and democracy, creating instability and\njeopardizing the development of our peoples.\nWe make this appeal from the perspective of a\ncountry that lived for more than 20 years with the\nviolence of terrorism, which took more than 20,000\nlives and cost billions of dollars in material losses.\nPeace is not just a beautiful sentiment; it is the\nprincipal value shared by peoples and a prerequisite for\nthe development of our nations. On the basis of that\nconviction, our Government is promoting, as one of the\nmain pillars of its foreign policy, a limit on military\nexpenditure at the regional level, with a view to freeing\nup resources for social investment and to combating\nwant and abject poverty.\nMy country's commitment goes beyond mere\nwords. In 2002, consistent with our proposals, we have\ntaken the decision to reduce our military expenditure\nby 20 per cent and to redirect the resources to health,\nnutrition and education. I am pleased to be able to say\nthat we have made progress in this respect, and we are\ngratified by our recent achievements in this area with\nour fraternal country Chile.\nToday more than ever, Peru would like to\nreaffirm, before the international community, that is it\ncommitted to the building of a participatory and\nefficient system of collective security. To this end, we\nare promoting the adoption of the Andean Charter for\nPeace and Security, which was approved in June by the\nministers of foreign affairs and defence of the Andean\nCommunity. Its resolute goal is to begin to formulate a\ncommunity policy of security and confidence-building,\nestablish an Andean zone of peace, improve and\nexpand confidence-building measures and thus reduce\nthe resources that are currently allocated to defence.\nPeru is pleased to announce that, in compliance\nwith its commitments under the Ottawa Convention, it\nhas completed the process of destroying its arsenals of\nanti-personnel mines. It is currently conducting its\nlargest demining operation to date, to reduce mines in\nborder regions, as part of an agreement signed in 1998\nwith the fraternal country Ecuador.\n13\n\nIn the same context, our Government reaffirms\nand renews its commitment to the creation of a South\nAmerican peace and cooperation zone, as declared in\nGuayaquil, Ecuador, on 27 July, during a meeting of\nSouth American heads of State or Government. We\npropose the inclusion in the agenda of the General\nAssembly of an item on the South American peace and\ncooperation zone and will encourage the adoption of a\ndraft resolution in that regard.\nWith regard of the promotion of democracy, Peru\nis today endeavouring fully to re-establish the\nfreedoms of its citizenry, strengthen its democratic\ninstitutions and resolutely fight against corruption. Our\nGovernment has begun this task with full respect for\ndemocratic values, as well as for the independence of\nthe branches of State power. I would also like to\nemphasize the efforts that we have been making to\nconsolidate our democracy through mechanisms of\ncoordination and political and social dialogue.\nIn July, my Government, the political parties, the\nbusiness sector, workers, churches and other civil\nsociety organizations signed a national accord that\ncontains 29 long-term State policies to be implemented\nby the current and future Governments over the next 20\nyears. This accord has characteristics that are unique in\nthe history of Peru, since for the first time various\npolitical institutions and representatives of civil society\nmet and together committed themselves to continuity in\nState policies in the areas of democracy, equality,\nsocial justice, competitiveness and transparency in\npolitical affairs.\nLikewise, I would like to emphasize the signing,\nat Peru's initiative, of the Inter-American Democratic\nCharter, adopted by the Organization of American\nStates on 11 September 2001. The Charter is an\neffective means of making the principles, norms and\nmechanisms of collective action consistent throughout\nthe region. That system includes sanctions, to be\napplied in cases of violations or breaches of democratic\ninstitutions, with a view to promoting, preserving and\ndefending democracy in the Latin America.\nIn the framework of the United Nations, we also\nencouraged the adoption by the Commission on Human\nRights of a draft resolution entitled \u201cFurther measures\nto promote and consolidate democracy\u201d, which set out,\nfor the first time within the United Nations system, a\nset of criteria to determine whether or not a regime is\ndemocratic. It includes so-called democratic clauses\nand legitimizes collective action for the protection and\ndefence of democracy.\nFrom another perspective, and bearing in mind\nthe objective of peace, the Government of Peru\nbelieves that building peace and good governance is a\nvital prerequisite for the preservation of liberty and the\nattainment of mutual and more equitable development.\nIn that regard, Peru is aware of the urgent need\nfor multilateral efforts \u2014 particularly by the richest\ncountries \u2014 to strengthen democracy. That is why we\nreiterate our proposal to create a mechanism of\nfinancial solidarity for the defence of democracy and\ngood governance.\nThe time has come to be creative \u2014 to create a\nmechanism for the financing of good governance and\ndemocracy among our peoples. We have said that\ndemocracy is costly. But democracy is a value that\ntranscends the vote, the ballot box and the institutions\nof the State. It is founded on the deepest aspirations of\nthe majority of our peoples, who are seeking their own\ndevelopment.\nFor that same reason, emerging democracies,\nwhich are today plagued by instability and uncertainty,\nurgently require new resources to facilitate public\ninvestment in the economies of the region aimed at re-\nenergizing them, generating employment and\nprotecting them from adverse financial shock. We are\nat a crossroads of Wall Street and Main Street, where\nwe must resolve the problems of our economies and yet\nlisten to the voices of our peoples demanding that their\njust aspirations be met. Our proposal, which we are\ntaking from door to door, forum to forum, and soul to\nsoul, is based on the conviction that Peruvian\ndemocracy is not an island in Latin America and the\nworld, and cannot therefore be evaluated in isolation\nfrom global realities. We must insert Peru and Latin\nAmerica in an interconnected world. We state this with\nthe firm conviction that what is at stake is more than\nPeru's democracy but rather the democracy of a system\nthat has proven to be the best.\nMy government, as I announced on the day when\nI took office, wishes to be remembered in history as\none that, with full respect for democracy and all the\nfundamental freedoms of men and women,\nstrengthened the development of Peru through\nproductive and dignified work and through the courage\nto invest more in better nutrition, health and education.\nFor this will be the best way to overcome the poverty\n14\n\nof nations. We are committed to facing the great\nproblems and challenges of our time by building\ndemocracy in a world that is more just and has greater\nsolidarity.\nToday, at the beginning of the twenty-first\ncentury, international democracy has a name: the\nUnited Nations. If the United Nations is weak, then it\nmust be strengthened; if it is slow, it must be given the\nmeans to act with greater effectiveness and speed. But\nwe cannot do without the framework of the United\nNations.\nPeru is firmly committed to policies and values\nthat support sustainable development. I am pleased in\nthis regard to announce that today I shall be depositing\nwith the Secretary-General the instrument through\nwhich Peru reaffirms the Kyoto Protocol. I call upon\nall other members of the international community that\nhave not yet done so to ratify that international\ninstrument in order to stem and reduce gas emissions\nthat harm our nations. This also relates to the\nphenomenon of El Ni\u00f1o, which has been afflicting Peru\nand the countries of the Pacific with increasing\nfrequency and intensity.\nI wish to reiterate the firm commitment of Peru,\nfirst of all, to cooperate with all States in the\ninternational fight against terrorism; secondly, to work\nfor peace and development, maintaining our proposal\nto limit military expenditures in South America and\ninstead to dedicate those resources to the fight against\npoverty; and thirdly, to strengthen international support\nfor democracy and good governance as an important\nstep in the battle that we are waging against poverty\nand extreme poverty in our nations."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to extend to\nMr. Kavan, on behalf of my delegation, sincere\ncongratulations on his election as the President of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-seventh regular session.\nMay I also thank his predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-\nsoo, whose tenure of office coincided with one of the\nmost trying periods in modern history following the 11\nSeptember terrorist attacks in the United States. We\nappreciate the excellent manner in which he handled\nthe fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. May I\nalso commend the efforts, courage and vision of the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, who has continued\nto be a beacon of strength and hope. We salute him. In\naddition, we also wish to welcome Switzerland to the\nUnited Nations and look forward to the admission of\nEast Timor.\nComing from a continent plagued with many\nobstacles, we believe that the fifty-seventh session of\nthe General Assembly affords us yet another\nopportunity to critically revisit the promises\nenumerated in the Millennium Declaration and to take\nstock of progress made so far. Two years down the line,\nwe should give an account of our commitment to the\nDeclaration. In many instances, I am afraid, we shall be\nfound wanting. We have not lived up to our promises\nand, as a result, many in the world are more desperate\ntoday than they were two years ago. They had placed\ntheir hope in our vision, our sincerity, our commitment\nand our sense of urgency and purpose.\nVarious United Nations conferences and meetings\nhave been held since the 1990s to address the\nchallenges confronting developing countries. It is\ntherefore regrettable that there has been insufficient\npolitical will to implement the decisions arising\ntherefrom. Meagre resources have been committed to\ndebt reduction, improving market access, human\nresource development and tackling the HIV/AIDS\npandemic and other diseases.\nThe current global financial framework has\ndemonstrated its inadequacy in dealing with the\nproblems facing developing countries. The decline in\nofficial development assistance flows and foreign\ndirect investment is an issue of concern. Despite efforts\nmade to achieve sustained economic growth and\nsustainable development, conditions in the\ninternational arena have not been adequately\nsupportive. For a start, my delegation calls for greater\nemphasis to be placed on concessionary lending and\ngreater use of grants.\nMoreover, global trade arrangements have tended\nto benefit industrialized countries. Africa's present\nshare of global trade is less than 2 per cent. While\nindustrialized countries continue to provide substantial\nsubsidies for their agricultural sector, developing\ncountries have been forced to cease similar support.\nThis, combined with tariff and non-tariff barriers to\ntrade, has meant that our products stand no chance of\ncompeting with the products from the North. We must\ntherefore build on the momentum achieved at Doha as\nwell as encourage initiatives, such as the African\nGrowth and Opportunity Act and the European Union/\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States trade\narrangements, to enable our countries take advantage\nof the opportunities in international trade.\nMany developing countries, including Kenya, are\nexperiencing a net outflow of resources, mainly due to\ndebt service obligations. As a result, there are fewer\nresources targeted towards basic social services, thus\ncompounding the poverty situation. We therefore call\n26\n\nfor an overhaul of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries\nDebt Initiative eligibility criteria so that countries\nfacing high levels of poverty and debt burden qualify\nfor debt relief.\nThe launching of the African Union and the New\nPartnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) have\nrekindled great hopes in the African continent. These\ninitiatives have made it clear that the primary\nresponsibility for the development of Africa lies in the\nhands of the Africans themselves. The decision by the\nUnited Nations General Assembly to hold a high-level\nplenary meeting on NEPAD on 16 September 2002\nrecognizes the importance of that initiative, which\nemphasizes the twin principles of ownership and\npartnership.\nKenya calls for genuine partnership in the\nimplementation of resolutions, commitments and,\nespecially, the Millennium Development Goals, the\nMonterrey Consensus and the Outcome of the just\nconcluded World Summit on Sustainable Development.\nThe special session of the General Assembly on\nchildren, held in May 2002, provided the international\ncommunity with an opportunity to renew its\ncommitment to the rights-based approach to children's\nprogrammes and activities. The Government of Kenya\nhas made continued efforts to improve the welfare of\nchildren. Kenya has ratified the Convention on the\nRights of the Child and has signed the Optional\nProtocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and\nchild pornography. Kenya has also ratified instruments\nprohibiting the involvement of children in armed\nconflict. A comprehensive Children's Statute was\nenacted in parliament and became operational on 1\nMarch 2002. Kenya also has in place an early\nchildhood development policy, safeguarding children\nfrom birth until the age of six.\nMy delegation notes with concern that the\nreduction in funding to the United Nations Population\nFund (UNFPA) by a major contributor will have a\nnegative impact on ongoing programmes in many\ndeveloping countries. The UNFPA continues to play\na critical role in assisting the most vulnerable in\nsociety \u2014 namely, women and adolescents. It is our\nhope that voluntary contributions to the organization\nwill be restored to their former level and further\nincreased as a matter of urgency.\nWith regard to the United Nations Centre in\nNairobi, my delegation welcomes the improvement in\nthe level of utilization of the conference facilities. We\nencourage the Secretary-General to take the necessary\nmeasures to ensure that all meetings and activities on\nenvironment and matters related to human settlements\nare held at the United Nations Office at Nairobi\n(UNON) so as to utilize the excellent facilities there\nand to further strengthen the role of the Organization in\nall matters charged to it in conformity with the\nheadquarters rule.\nMy delegation would like to commend the fifty-\nsixth session of the General Assembly for elevating the\nCommission on Human Settlements to a fully fledged\nprogramme now known as the Governing Council of\nthe United Nations Human Settlements Programme\n(UN-Habitat), and the United Nations Centre for\nHuman Settlements (Habitat) to be its secretariat. We\nhave no doubt that the upgrading will facilitate the\nimplementation of the Habitat Agenda and the\nDeclaration on Cities and Other Human Settlements in\nthe New Millennium.\nThe Secretary-General's programme budget for\nthe biennium 2002-2003 shows that the activities\nundertaken by the United Nations Environment\nProgramme (UNEP) and UN-Habitat continue to\ndepend heavily on extrabudgetary resources. This has\nseverely constrained the ability of both organizations to\nplay their roles effectively due to an unpredictable\nfinancial resource base and under-provision. We urge\nthe Secretary-General to ensure stability and\npredictability in funding UNEP and UN-Habitat\nthrough the United Nations regular budget.\nMy delegation would like to congratulate the\nnewly appointed High Commissioner for Human\nRights, His Excellency Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello. We\nwould like to assure him of our full cooperation, and\nwe look forward to working very closely with him. At\nthe same time, we wish to pay tribute to the outgoing\nHigh Commissioner, Her Excellency Mrs. Mary\nRobinson, for her able leadership.\nKenya wishes to underscore the importance of\ntreating human rights issues in a balanced manner. This\nvery Assembly has consistently reaffirmed:\n\u201cthat all human rights are universal, indivisible,\ninterdependent and interrelated and that the\ninternational community must treat human rights\nglobally in a fair and equal manner, on the same\n27\n\nfooting and with the same emphasis\u201d. (resolution\n56/165, seventh preambular paragraph)\nI am afraid that this has not always been so.\nThere is a genuine concern that too much\nemphasis has been given to political rights at the\nexpense of economic and social rights, such as the right\nto development. These are vital issues that the\ninternational community can no longer afford to take\nlightly as it endeavours to eliminate hunger and\npoverty and ensure a just standard of living for all\npeople.\nKenya holds the view that the General Assembly\nshould play a leading role in spearheading development\ninitiatives, as envisaged in the Charter. We welcome\nthe progress already made in the reorganization and\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. This organ\nshould now reclaim its leadership role in focusing and\nshaping debate on issues of global interest.\nOn issues of world security, Kenya has a long\nrecord of participation in peacekeeping operations.\nToday, Kenya is the sixth largest troop contributor to\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations in different\nparts of the world. We are particularly happy to be\nassociated with the success of United Nations\npeacekeeping operations in East Timor, Sierra Leone,\nand on the border between Ethiopia and Eritrea.\nGreater emphasis should be put on the\ndeployment of adequate force levels to missions in\nAfrica. In particular, we would like to see greater\nsupport in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nAfrica is a continent ravaged by conflicts and\ninstability. However, the recent progress in the\nresolution of some of these conflicts is very\nencouraging. In particular, the signing of a protocol\nbetween the Government of the Sudan and the Sudan\nPeople's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) in\nMachakos, Kenya on 20 July 2002 was a very welcome\ndevelopment. Other positive developments towards\nlasting peace in Africa include the signing of an\nagreement between the Democratic Republic of Congo\nand the Rwandese Republic, the holding of peaceful\nelections in Sierra Leone after years of bitter civil war,\nand continuing efforts towards reconciliation of the\nwarring factions in Somalia. We also welcome the\nrecent positive developments in Angola. Kenya will\ncontinue with its mediation efforts in the region and in\nthe continent as a whole.\nOn the important question of reform of the\nSecurity Council, Kenya calls for the speedy\nconclusion of negotiations aimed at equitable\nrepresentation and an increase in membership in the\nSecurity Council. With the establishment of the Peace\nand Security Council as an important organ of the new\nAfrican Union, Africa must now play its rightful role in\nmatters of international peace and security. It is time\nAfrica was accorded the elevated status it deserves in\nthe Security Council.\nKenya believes in the rule of law and will support\nall genuine efforts to this end. We subscribe to peaceful\nsettlement of disputes through regional efforts, the\nInternational Tribunals and the International Court of\nJustice. Kenya fully supports the historic milestone of\nthe adoption of the Rome Statute in 1998 and its entry\ninto force on 1 July 2002. Impunity for serious war\ncrimes is indeed a denial of justice, which must be\nbrought to an end.\nIn 2001, we witnessed the most devastating form\nof international terrorism in the multiple terrorist\nattacks of 11 September. As a country that faced a\nsimilar attack in 1998, Kenya strongly believes that\nterrorism can never be justified under any\ncircumstances. We fully support the implementation of\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) and have\nalready ratified the 12 anti-terrorism conventions. The\nprocess of domesticating them is already under way.\nIn conclusion, Kenya looks forward to greater\ncommitment to build a secure and more prosperous\nworld for all. The destiny of mankind is inextricably\nintertwined in spite of national boundaries. Events in\nthe global arena have clearly demonstrated that the\neffects of ignorance, poverty, disease and insecurity in\none region or another country can impact negatively on\nthe well-being of the rest of the world. Let us get\ntogether and build a world where all can live in peace\nand prosperity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like at the outset to join other\nspeakers in congratulating you, Sir, on your election to\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nseventh session. We are fully confident that, under your\nable leadership, the work of the General Assembly will\nfurther advance the cause of international cooperation\nin the interests of humankind.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\nwelcome the Swiss Confederation, which has become\nthe one hundred and ninetieth Member of our world\nOrganization. I am also pleased to extend a warm\nwelcome to the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste,\nwhich will soon be joining our global Organization.\nI believe that we are living in a fragile and fast-\nchanging world, a world of uncertainties and\nturbulence that has been seriously threatened by\nterrorism, the negative aspects of globalization, the\nrising effects of global warming and the impact of\nclimate change. The effects of these rising forces\nunderline our common vulnerability and recall the\nurgent need for more effective sustainable development\nin the world, without which the survival of humanity\nmay be jeopardized. I therefore believe that the\ncommon challenge we face today is perhaps the lack of\ncollective wisdom and political will to make our world\na better place for all, including future generations.\nThe recent World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment in Johannesburg rightly discussed the\nfundamental issues confronting humanity: climate\nchange, global sustainable development and poverty.\nThe dramatic appeal made by many leaders of the\nworld at that Summit must be taken very seriously as\nan important message about the need to save the Earth\nfrom destruction and to reverse the global trends of\nwidening development gaps, increasing poverty and\nenvironmental destruction.\nWith respect to the environment, I believe that\nhumanity as a whole is now confronting severe global\nwarming, unprecedented flooding and the increasingly\ndisastrous effects of greenhouse gases. This is no\nlonger just a scientific theory, but a living reality. For\nthe first time this year, we have experienced mega-\nfloods and serious droughts across continents \u2014 from\nAsia to Europe, from Africa to South America \u2014 that\nhave wrought immense destruction and cost billions of\ndollars. We must seek to reverse these negative trends\nfor the survival of humanity. In this regard, I think that\nwe should all welcome and strongly support the bold\nmessage of the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment, the ultimate goal of which was to ensure\nthe survival of humanity and to fight poverty and\nenvironmental destruction.\nI also wish to recall the 2000 Millennium\nDeclaration, which centred on fighting poverty,\ncombating HIV/AIDS, ensuring sustainable\ndevelopment and forging a common partnership for\ndevelopment. In the same vein, the United Nations\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, held in March in Monterrey, Mexico,\ncalled on the developed countries to provide greater\nassistance to the least developed. Without adequate\nresources, it will be difficult for the least developed\ncountries to break out of the vicious cycle of poverty\nand to catch up with the current process of\nglobalization. I believe that this is a question not of\ngenerosity, but of human dignity and of sharing the\nwealth of the world in which we all live in the most\nequitable way.\n(spoke in English)\nAs the world continues to be shaped by the forces\nof globalization, we are witnessing growing disparities\nand development gaps between the haves and have-\nnots. As a double-edged sword, globalization could\neither help to propel humanity as a whole to greater\nprosperity or further marginalize the poor. I believe\nthat reducing poverty could contribute to some extent\nto the fight against terrorism and effectively manage\nthe growth of transnational issues, such as human\ntrafficking and the prevalent HIV/AIDS epidemic.\nIn this context, the Cambodian Government,\nunder the leadership of Prime Minister Samdech Hun\nSen, has made the fight against poverty a top priority\nof its strategy. In addition, human rights and\ndemocracy in Cambodia have been further\nstrengthened. In February this year, Cambodia for the\nfirst time organized free and fair local elections as part\nof its decentralization policy and its efforts to\nstrengthen grass-roots democracy. Moreover,\nCambodia remains committed to contributing actively\ntowards the realization of integration of the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), so\n13\n\nthat ASEAN may move forward in a collective spirit\nand play its constructive role in deepening East Asian\ncooperation as a whole. In this regard, the forthcoming\nGreater Mekong subregion and ASEAN summits in\nPhnom Penh in early November will be important\nvenues for ASEAN leaders to further promote ASEAN\nintegration and build closer cooperation in East Asia,\nencompassing the 10 nations of South-East Asia,\nChina, Japan and the Republic of Korea.\nOn regional issues that concern the whole\ninternational community, I wish to raise the Middle\nEast conflict first. I believe that the international\ncommunity has to help find a viable solution which\ncould bring lasting peace to the region. Cambodia\nstrongly believes that violence in any form is not a\nsolution. On the contrary, violence provokes more\nviolence. The Palestinian people have an inalienable\nright to dispose of their own State, living in peace with\nIsrael. I think that both sides must have the wisdom to\nunderstand that they are condemned to living side by\nside forever. Therefore, it is better for both sides to\nremain at peace with each other than to engage in\nendless war.\nSecondly, with regard to the Iraqi situation,\nCambodia believes that Iraq's acceptance of the return\nof United Nations weapons inspectors is an important\nstep that will certainly contribute to defusing the\nsituation in the region.\nThirdly, on the Kashmir problem, I believe that\nwe need to avoid the escalation of that conflict. If not\nproperly managed, the Kashmir conflict could seriously\nescalate and thus threaten regional peace and security\nnot only in South Asia, but also in South-East Asia. We\nmust do what we can to ensure that the terrorists cannot\nseize the opportunity of that conflict to further\ncomplicate the present situation.\nOn a more optimistic note, I believe that the\nrecent positive developments in the Korean\npeninsula \u2014 especially the resumption of North-South\ndialogue and the historic visit of Japanese Prime\nMinister Koizumi to Pyongyang \u2014 are significant\nmilestones towards the normalization of the situation\nthere.\nAs far as the fight against terrorism is concerned,\nCambodia has signed and is in the process of acceding\nto all 12 conventions related to the combat against\nterrorism. ASEAN, for its part, has been forceful and\ndecisive in coming up with a number of initiatives and\nmeasures. The ASEAN leaders, at their Seventh\nSummit in Brunei in November 2001, adopted the\nASEAN Declaration on Joint Action to Counter\nTerrorism. In addition, there have been a number of\nagreements and specific action plans that ASEAN and\nthe ASEAN Regional Forum have put in place in order\nto tackle the threats of terrorism in our region. In July\nthis year, ASEAN and the United States signed an anti-\nterrorism declaration as a framework for more\ncooperation to prevent and combat global terrorism.\nNow, I wish to address the issue of reforming the\nUnited Nations, particularly the Security Council,\nwhich I believe we should not simply ignore or take a\nstatus quo approach to. I believe that the United\nNations cannot continue to work in its current modus\noperandi if we want to further improve this important\nglobal institution and to have it truly reflect the needs\nand political realities of the world in the twenty-first\ncentury, to which it should be adapted as soon as\npossible. Any attempt to further delay United Nations\nreform, in my view, will only undermine the credibility\nof this universal institution.\nAccordingly, I wish to reiterate Cambodia's call for the\nexpansion of the Security Council to include other new\nmembers. In that regard, Cambodia would support\nJapan, the Federal Republic of Germany and India as\nnew permanent members of the Security Council,\ntaking into account the growing political and economic\nroles of those countries in world affairs.\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate that peace,\nstability and poverty are all interrelated and affect all\npeoples and nations of the planet. From that point of\nview, it is essential that we continue to work together\nto build a caring community of nations, where the\ndevelopment gap between the developed and the\ndeveloping countries is reduced, the threat of terrorism\nis totally eliminated, the menace of the HIV/AIDS\npandemic is curbed, poverty is alleviated and global\nwarming is kept in check. That will be possible only by\nbuilding better cooperation and closer partnership,\nfostering mutual respect, cultivating greater tolerance\nand enhancing the spirit of a real United Nations for\nall. I strongly believe that we can do that through\ncollective will and strong determination, as well as\nbetter ethics and moral responsibility, which will help\n14\n\nus make a better world for all peoples in the twenty-\nfirst century.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, it gives\nme great pleasure to join others in congratulating you\non your election to the presidency of this session of the\nGeneral Assembly. This is not only a recognition of\nyour wisdom and ability to successfully guide the work\nof this important session, but also a demonstration of\nthe high regard the international community has for\nyour country, the Czech Republic.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to pay\ntribute to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Han\nSeung-soo of the Republic of Korea, for the exemplary\nmanner in which he guided the work of the fifty-sixth\nsession.\nOn behalf of my Government, I would like to\nextend a very warm welcome to Switzerland on its\nadmission to the membership of this Organization. We\nare eagerly looking forward to welcoming the\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste into our midst\nshortly.\nEight days ago, the friendly people of the United\nStates remembered, with profound sorrow, the death\nand destruction inflicted upon them by murderous acts\nof terrorism on 11 September 2001. Those brutal and\ncowardly acts sent waves of deep shock and anger\nthroughout the world. My country was quick to\ncondemn the attacks and to express its solidarity with\nthe people of the United States. We shared their grief,\nand we extended our sympathies to the American\npeople. Today, with our modest resources, we stand\nwith the international community in the global fight\nagainst terrorism and in banishing the scourge of\nterrorism from the face of the earth.\nMy country believes that the United Nations, the\nprimary global organization responsible for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, must\nplay the central role in the fight against terrorism. We\nwere encouraged by the swift response of the Security\nCouncil, taken under Chapter VII of the Charter, after\nthe horrifying attacks on the United States last year.\nTotal compliance with Security Council resolution\n1373 (2001), which details the measures to be taken by\nthe international community in combating terrorism, is\nof utmost importance. My country also believes that it\nis essential to strengthen the existing national, regional\nand international legal framework against terrorism if\nwe are to effectively fight this war. The proposed\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism\nand the international convention for the suppression of\nacts of nuclear terrorism need to be finalized as soon as\npossible.\nThe unprecedented economic ramifications of the\nevents of Nine-Eleven were enormous. Small island\ndeveloping States like my own have not recovered\nfrom the adverse economic effects of the events yet,\nthus demonstrating the vulnerability of our economies.\nOur losses were immeasurable. Nonetheless, recent\ndevelopments in the area of international economic\ncooperation appear encouraging. The Doha agenda and\nthe Monterrey consensus offer new hope for achieving\nsustainable development. The transformation of those\ncommitments into concrete action, and achievement of\nthe Millennium Development Goals depends on forging\na new form of partnership with shared responsibility\nbetween the developing countries and the rest of the\nworld. We expect the developed countries to fulfil their\npart of the understandings, while the developing\ncountries endeavour to fulfil their obligations.\nMy country, the Maldives, has made considerable\neconomic strides in the past. With the continued\nassistance of the international community, we have\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of official development\nassistance (ODA). It is true that two decades of\npolitical stability, and sound social and fiscal policies,\n5\n\ncombined with hard work, have improved the standard\nof living of our people. We are immensely proud of our\nmodest achievements and grateful to those who helped\nus. Yet, our narrow economic base poses formidable\nchallenges to our desire for continued economic\ngrowth.\nGlobalization and trade liberalization have added\nnew dimensions to our difficulties. The inherent\nstructural weaknesses of our economy convince us that\nthe preferential access to markets and concessional\ncapital we now enjoy as a least developed country have\nno alternative form of compensation. Quite simply, we\ncannot sustain our development without these special\ntreatments.\nThese considerations compel us to strongly resist\nthe call for the graduation of our country from the list\nof least developed countries. We genuinely believe that\nthe international community should continue assisting\nus in our quest to overcome the structural constraints\nimpeding our arrival at a level of sustainable growth\nuntil we overcome the inherent vulnerabilities of our\neconomy.\nThe Committee for Development Policy will\npresent its recommendations on the question of\ngraduation of the Maldives from the list of least\ndeveloped countries to the substantive session of the\nEconomic and Social Council in the year 2003. We\nurge the Committee to complete the necessary\ngroundwork, in accordance with all the relevant\nEconomic and Social Council and General Assembly\nresolutions, before it gives its views on this very\nimportant matter.\nA fortnight ago, we met in Johannesburg at the\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development to take\nstock of our achievements since the Earth Summit in\nRio 10 years ago. The facts are disappointing and\ndiscouraging. What we have achieved over the past 10\nyears is far less than what we have not. And, while\napathy keeps progress curbed, environmental\ndegradation of the world is continuing unabated. If we\nare to halt and reverse environmental degradation, we\nmust not only pledge urgent action but also take it. As\nPresident Abdul Gayoom of the Republic of Maldives\nemphasized in his address to the World Summit on\nSustainable Development, for sustainable development\nto happen,\n\u201cAgenda 21 must be implemented. The Kyoto\nProtocol must be universally honoured. The\nBarbados Programme of Action must be carried\nout. The Millennium Development Goals must be\nreached\u201d.\nMy country, the survival of which is threatened by\nclimate change, therefore remains concerned over\ninaction and indifference with regard to the\nimplementation of the plans of action for\nenvironmental protection and sustainable development.\nTurning to another issue, we have been\nwitnessing an unprecedented deterioration of the\nsituation in Palestine and the Middle East. The Israeli\nGovernment has killed the peace process and has\ndriven the region to the brink of war. Its acts of\naggression and the use of excessive force, coupled with\npolitical assassinations, the destruction of vital\ninstallations and infrastructure, blockades and\neconomic suffocation of the Palestinian people, are all\ndesigned to frustrate the prospects for an independent\nPalestinian State. We condemn these dastardly actions\nand call on the international community to persuade\nIsrael to withdraw from all occupied Palestinian\nterritories and to respect all relevant Security Council\nresolutions. The Maldives has consistently supported\nthe just struggle of the Palestinian people to regain\ntheir inalienable rights and to establish an independent\nPalestinian State with Al-Quds as its capital.\nWe believe that the United Nations has an\nimportant role to play in bringing the two sides back to\nthe negotiating table. We recognize the efforts of the\nQuartet, and encourage its members, especially the\nUnited States, to remain actively engaged in the search\nfor a just, permanent and lasting peace in the region.\nDisarmament and arms control measures should\nremain a high priority on the international agenda. The\ninternational community must unite and act\ncollectively to strengthen and enforce the non-\nproliferation regimes. The Maldives is party to all\nmajor multilateral instruments relating to arms control\nand disarmament, including the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We call on\nthose countries that are not party to those instruments\nto accede to them as soon as possible. Furthermore, my\ncountry believes that the establishment of nuclear-\nweapon-free zones and zones of peace in various parts\nof the world can contribute immensely to the efforts of\nthe international community in this regard.\n6\n\nAs well, we should vigorously pursue our efforts\nand enforce verifiable measures to rid the world of\nbiological and chemical weapons that can cause mass\ndestruction. My country, therefore, believes that\nbilateral, regional and multilateral approaches must be\nreinforced and that they must complement one another\nif we are to free the world of those deadly weapons. We\nbelieve also that, on global issues, there should be a\nsincere commitment to multilateralism and trust in the\nmultilateral institutions. The United Nations must not\nonly be placed at the centre of multilateral processes,\nbut should remain the principal player responsible for\ngrappling with these important global issues, which\nhave such a great bearing on international peace and\nsecurity.\nIn conclusion, allow me to reiterate the firm\ncommitment of the Maldives to the principles and\npurposes enshrined in the Charter of the United\nNations. We firmly believe that the United Nations\nrequires reform and restructuring. The aim of the\nreform process should be the enhancement of the\ncredibility, legitimacy and universal character of the\nO1rganization. This involves the reform of the Security\nCouncil, a new working relationship, and a strong\nenforcement regime within the United Nations and\namong its Member States.\nTogether with other members of the international\ncommunity, the Maldives will work to uphold and\npromote the objectives of the United Nations. We\nremain convinced that the United Nations is the only\norganization that is capable of creating a more peaceful\nand prosperous world for humanity.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is\nimperative, now more than ever before, that all the\npeoples of the world act in a spirit of solidarity. The\nUnited Nations embodies this spirit. In joining the\nUnited Nations, Switzerland sends you a message of\nsolidarity. This makes me proud and happy.\nI would like to add my thanks to those expressed\nlast Tuesday by Kaspar Villiger, the President of the\nSwiss Confederation, on the occasion of Switzerland's\nformal admission to the United Nations. I would also\nlike to thank all the Members of the United Nations for\nthe warm welcome they have given my country.\nSwitzerland feels welcomed. We feel that we are where\nwe belong.\nI would also like to give Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan my profound thanks. His sincerity and wisdom\ncontributed greatly to convincing the people of\nSwitzerland of the need to join the United Nations.\nI would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection. I already know and value your qualities and\ntalents and I know that you will put them to the best\nservice of the United Nations. Switzerland is pleased to\nbe working with you towards the success of this\nsession of the General Assembly.\nThe Swiss people have decided to join the United\nNations. They have said yes' to increased cooperation\nwith the United Nations. They have said yes' to a\nstronger international commitment. They have said\nyes' to taking greater responsibility for meeting the\nchallenges that face humankind.\nThe challenges facing the international\ncommunity at the beginning of the twenty-first century\nare immense. A number of regions suffer from terrible\npoverty. Crises and wars are rife on all continents.\nThere are millions of refugees. We see the hideous face\nof terrorism. Criminal networks exploit human beings\nand traffic shamefully in drugs and arms. New diseases\nare emerging and, day after day, we continue to destroy\nthe Earth's ecological balance.\nThere are no simple answers to any of these\nproblems, but there is a place where we can all meet to\nfind solutions: the United Nations. The world needs a\nstrong United Nations, as it is the only universal\nOrganization working at the global level. It alone can\nanalyse problems at the world level. It alone can create\na consensus between States on common goals. Finally,\nas stressed by the Secretary-General, there is no\nsubstitute for the unique international legitimacy\nprovided to principles and choices of action by the\nUnited Nations.\nSwitzerland has joined the United Nations as a\nneutral country and we intend to remain neutral. Our\nneutral status, however, in no way diminishes our\ndesire for cooperation. On the contrary, it is an\nadvantage for our peace activities. Our membership of\nthe United Nations is not a change in direction, but the\nlogical consequence of our foreign policy.\nTo quote our Constitution, the Swiss\nConfederation is committed \u00d6 to a just and peaceful\ninternational order'. The principal aim of the United\nNations is to maintain international peace and security.\nFor us, therefore, the United Nations is the ideal place\nto carry out this vital mission. As a Member of the\nUnited Nations, Switzerland will devote itself\nresolutely to international peace and security. That\ncommitment will be focused, above all, on armed\n27\n\nconflicts. The logic of armed conflicts today forces us\nto adopt a multidimensional approach to peace\nprocesses. If we are to succeed, we must work in\nseveral different areas in parallel: military, diplomatic,\nhumanitarian and economic. We must also involve all\ninterested players in the process. All this demands a\nmajor effort of coordination, and Switzerland will\ncontribute to that.\nSecurity problems, moreover, must be addressed\nfrom a broader angle  that of human security. The\ninhabitants of this world must be able to live without\nfear of war, starvation and despotism. In particular, we\nmust protect vulnerable individuals and groups.\nSwitzerland will therefore pursue its efforts in favour\nof human security. This includes stopping the\nrecruitment of child soldiers, eliminating anti-\npersonnel mines and halting the proliferation of small\narms.\nIn this context, I welcome the Secretary-\nGeneral's appeal to make full use of multilateral\ninstitutions. This is especially valid for the\nmaintenance of international peace and security. There\nis only one source of legitimacy for the use of force:\nthe United Nations.\nIraq has been discussed on several occasions\nduring these past days. There is undeniably a need to\nact, and to act with determination, in order to ensure\nthe implementation of United Nations resolutions, but\naction must be taken together, within the United\nNations. Only the United Nations can confer\ninternational legitimacy to any action against Iraq.\nSwitzerland is convinced that peace and\ndevelopment can be sustained only if they go hand in\nhand with freedom, democracy, and respect for human\nrights. Human dignity is our most precious asset. It\nmust be defended at all times and in all places. We will\nchampion this conviction at the United Nations to the\nfull and without concessions. For as long as men and\nwomen are exploited, children are mistreated and the\ndeath penalty is carried out, Switzerland will do\neverything within its power to defend human dignity.\nAt the General Assembly this year, we will strive\nin particular to promote the adoption of the draft\noptional protocol to the United Nations Convention\nagainst Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading\nTreatment or Punishment. This protocol is needed to\ngive better protection to people in detention against\ntorture and mistreatment. That is why we have been\nsupporting this initiative for years.\nIn its capacity as the Depositary State,\nSwitzerland feels a special responsibility to promote\nawareness of and respect for the Geneva Conventions\nand their Additional Protocols. At the United Nations,\nwe will continue tirelessly to defend these instruments.\nIn this area, Switzerland has submitted to a number of\ncountries involved in the Middle East conflict a\nproposal which aims to ensure the better\nimplementation of international humanitarian law. We\nadvocate two mechanisms: one for promoting dialogue\nto allow the parties to settle problems concerning the\napplication of international humanitarian law; the\nsecond, a mechanism to monitor respect for\nhumanitarian law.\nWe are also convinced that the International\nCriminal Court will ensure the better application of\ninternational humanitarian law. This new Court is an\nessential tool for dealing with serious violations of the\nfundamental human freedoms. We will therefore\nremain on our guard to ensure that it can function\nefficiently and we will pursue our efforts to convince\nthose States that have not yet signed the Rome Statute\nof the need for such a Court.\nTwo days ago, we commemorated the tragic\nevents that shook the United States and the world one\nyear ago. The causes of terrorism must be eradicated. I\nam thinking, inter alia, of injustice, disregard for the\nrights of minorities, and poverty. That is one of the\nobjectives of our development cooperation and of our\nhuman rights policy.\nSustainable development and the elimination of\npoverty remain mankind's main challenges today. We\nsaw that again at Johannesburg. They are global\nchallenges that require a global strategy and global\nsolidarity. In other words, they require coordinated\naction by the United Nations institutions, as well as\ngreater cooperation between the United Nations, the\ndevelopment banks, civil society and the private sector.\nDevelopment cooperation must be coordinated.\nSwitzerland will contribute to strengthening the\ncoordination efforts vital to ensuring that our activities\nenjoy the success they merit.\nThe struggle against poverty also requires greater\nexchange of expertise and better transfer of technology.\nSwitzerland is closely involved in the preparation of\nthe World Summit on the Information Society, the first\n28\n\nphase of which will take place in Geneva in 2003. The\nmain challenge of that Summit is the very gap between\nNorth and South in terms of access to new information\ntechnologies. Therefore, I call on all to contribute\nactively to the success of that conference.\nThese thoughts lead me to refer to Geneva, the\ninternational city that is a close and longstanding link\nbetween my country and the United Nations.\nSwitzerland is proud and grateful to be able to host the\nEuropean Headquarters of the United Nations and\nmany specialized agencies. Geneva is the main\ninternational hub of disarmament, humanitarian aid,\nsocial development, the promotion of human rights and\nenvironmental protection. That gives me great\npleasure, because Swiss citizens are particularly\nconcerned about these issues. However, that also\ninvolves the special responsibility of offering\ninternational organizations optimum working and\nliving conditions. You can also count on Switzerland in\nthat area.\nBefore Switzerland became a Member, the United\nNations was already a universal Organization, but with\nSwitzerland  and soon Timor-Leste  the United\nNations will be even more universal. The United\nNations is the greatest world forum. Switzerland will\nprovide it its full support in the interests of humanity\nand the interests of we, the peoples of the United\nNations."

        "file_text": "\ufeffA\nyear ago, the General Assembly had to be postponed\nbecause of the ruthless crime committed on 11\nSeptember. There was then a worldwide wave of\nsolidarity towards the people of the United States and,\nparticularly, towards the families of the almost 3,000\ninnocent victims of that unjustifiable terrorist attack.\nThe conditions were created for setting up a\ngenuine international alliance under the auspices and\nleadership of the United Nations, with absolute respect\nfor the purposes and principles enshrined in its Charter.\nNearly all countries, above and beyond ideological,\npolitical, cultural and religious differences, expressed\nour willingness to collaborate actively with this\nendeavour of unmistakable common interest.\nHowever, another vision was imposed. In an\nunusual fashion, it was stated that whoever did not\nsupport the war decided upon by a single country\nwould then be on the side of terrorism. It was even\nannounced to the Security Council that that country\nreserved the right to launch future attacks on its own\nagainst other nations. A unilateral war was then\nunleashed, whose death toll is still unknown to us and\nwhose most tangible consequence is probably the blow\nto the credibility of the United Nations and to\nmultilateralism as a means to cope with the complex\nchallenges currently ahead of us.\nWhat is the outcome today? There are greater\nfeelings of hatred, vengeance and insecurity, which are\nnot helpful in the fight against terrorism. Dangerous\nxenophobic and discriminatory tendencies threaten the\nexistence of a plural and democratic world. There has\nbeen a step backward in the field of public freedoms\nand civil rights.\nIn the meantime, there is a lack of political will\nby certain powers to rigorously apply, without\nselectivity and without double standards, the 12\nexisting international legal instruments on terrorism. In\naddition, no advances have been made in the definition,\nso indispensable today, of State terrorism.\nFor its part, Cuba \u2014 a victim of terrorist acts for\nover four decades, which stated its opinions in the\nAssembly with poise and firmness and unwaveringly\ncondemned the crime of September 11 and terrorism as\nsuch, but which also opposed the war out of ethical\nconsiderations and the respect for international law \u2014\nsigned and ratified the 12 international conventions to\ncombat terrorism and adopted a national law to fight\nthis scourge. It has cooperated fully with the work of\nthe committee set up for such purposes by the Security\nCouncil and, at the bilateral level, it proposed to the\nUnited States Government the adoption of a\nprogramme to combat terrorism, which was,\nincomprehensibly, rejected by that Government.\nUntil today, and despite the fact that it has not\ndeveloped and has no intention ever to develop nuclear\nweapons, Cuba has not been a State party to the Treaty\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, for it is\nan insufficient and discriminatory instrument allowing\nthe establishment of a club of nuclear powers without\nany concrete disarmament commitments. However, as a\nsignal of the clear political will of the Cuban\nGovernment and its commitment to an effective\ndisarmament process that ensures world peace, our\ncountry has decided to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons. In doing so, we\nreaffirm our hope that all nuclear weapons will finally\nbe totally eliminated under strict international\nverification.\n20\n\nIn addition, and despite the fact that the only\nnuclear power in the Americas pursues a policy of\nhostility towards Cuba that does not rule out the use of\nforce, Cuba will also ratify the Treaty for the\nProhibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and\nthe Caribbean, known as the Treaty of Tlatelolco, that\nwas signed by our country in 1995.\nOn a day like today, I would like to repeat Cuba's\nremarks at the last session of the General Assembly:\n\u201cOnly under the leadership of the United\nNations will we be able to defeat terrorism.\nCooperation, and not war, is the way. The\ncoordination of actions, and not imposition ... is\nthe method. ...\n\u201cCuba reiterates its condemnation of\nterrorism in all of its forms and manifestations.\nCuba reiterates that it will not allow its territory\never to be used for terrorist acts against the\npeople of the United States or of any other\ncountry.\u201d (A/56/PV.50, pp. 21 and 22)\nWhy have we not seen the same zeal with which\nthe war in Afghanistan was unleashed in the search for\na just and lasting solution for peace in the Middle East?\nWhy have some refrained from uttering even a single\nword to condemn the aggressions against the territory\nof Palestine and the crimes against its people? Why has\nthere not been any condemnation of the selective\nassassinations and the use of the armed forces against\nthe civilian population? Why are there assurances of\nimpunity for the actions of the Israeli army, thus tying\nthe hands of the Security Council? Why have there not\nbeen any firm actions to implement the Security\nCouncil resolutions that ensure the proclamation of an\nindependent and sovereign Palestinian State, with East\nJerusalem as its capital? Why is the only superpower\non the planet acting differently from one case to the\nother? Why is there no end to the suffering of the\nPalestinian mothers whose children are also murdered,\nlike the innocent people on 11 September? These\nquestions should be answered by those who in this Hall\ncarry upon their shoulders the responsibility for what is\ncurrently happening in the occupied Palestinian and\nArab territories.\nA new war against Iraq already seems inevitable;\nan aggravation of the situation of constant aggression\nthat that people has lived in over the last ten years. The\nbuzzword now is \u201cpre-emptive war\u201d, in open violation\nof the spirit and the letter of the United Nations\nCharter.\nCuba defends principles, not expedience.\nTherefore, although its supporters may feel upset, it\nemphatically opposes this war. Cuba is not driven by\nan anti-American spirit, even when its Government\nmaintains and strengthens a 40-year-old blockade\nagainst our people. But refraining from telling the truth\nout of cowardice or political calculation is not\ncharacteristic of Cuban revolutionaries. Therefore,\nCuba hereby states that it opposes a new military\naction against Iraq. It does so while recalling that at\none point it supported the Security Council resolution\nasking the Iraqi Government to end the occupation of\nKuwait.\nWe believe that the development of weapons of\nmass destruction today would be insane, because the\nonly possible way that we envision for world peace is\nthrough general and complete disarmament, including\nnuclear disarmament, and the rechannelling of the\nmoney currently spent on weapons to address the dire\nsocio-economic problems of humankind.\nThe Arab countries have been emphatic in their\nrejection of this war, and most European countries do\nnot approve of it. The international community is\nincreasingly concerned about the announcement of a\nnew war on the basis of unconfirmed allegations and\ndisregarding the obvious reality that Iraq cannot pose a\ndanger to the United States.\nIf the United States Government unleashes a new\nwar against Iraq, either by imposing it on the Security\nCouncil or by deciding upon it unilaterally in\nopposition to international public opinion, we will bear\nwitness to the emergence of a century of unilateralism\nand the forced retirement of the United Nations. It will\nthen seem that the cold war years \u2014 with its distant\nmemory of bipolarism, mistakes and contradictions \u2014\nwere not as futile and perilous as the era that is now\ninexorably looming over the world.\nThe United Nations has to be saved. Cuba\ndefends the need both for its preservation and for its\nmost profound reform and democratization, but all this\nmust be accomplished through respect for its Charter\nand not by rewriting it or distorting its purposes and\nprinciples. The General Assembly must ultimately be\nallowed to play the role laid down for it in the Charter.\nThe Security Council has to be rescued from the\ndisrepute and doubts that are so rightly weighing it\n21\n\ndown, so that it may become a truly representative\nbody. I am talking about the presence of the third world\nand not about military power as a justification for\nmembership of a democratic body; I am talking about\neliminating the veto and other antidemocratic practices\nfrom a transparent body; and I am talking about putting\nan end to the secret conspiracies and to the substantive\ndecisions made in private by a mere few and then\nimposed on the rest.\nToday, when it is more threatened than ever, Cuba\nstrongly defends the need to preserve multilateralism in\ninternational relations. That is why we have witnessed\nin frustration the disappointing completion of the\nnegotiations for the establishment of the International\nCriminal Court, which Cuba supported on the\nunderstanding that it would be a truly impartial, non-\nselective, efficient and independent body to\ncomplement national justice systems. To use the\nSecurity Council as a tool to amend de facto the\ninternational treaty that gave birth to the Court, or to\nimpose upon others humiliating bilateral agreements,\ncompelling them to violate their international\nobligations deriving from that instrument, is not only\narrogant, but also irresponsible.\nThe International Criminal Court now vaunted is\nnot the body that we need and have fought for, subject\nas it is to hegemonic political interests and already a\npotential victim of manipulation, and bound from its\ninception to the decisions of a permanent member of\nthe Security Council. What real international justice\ncan be expected of a body that lacks a definition of the\ncrime of aggression or that will receive instructions\nfrom the Security Council either to call off or to\npostpone a trial indefinitely at the request of one of its\npermanent members? Who can guarantee that the Court\nwill not end up becoming an instrument at the service\nof interventionism and domination by the most\npowerful countries?\nCuba reiterates here today what it expressed at\nthe recent Johannesburg Summit: a reworking of\ninternational financial institutions is called for. A\nlegitimate replacement for the International Monetary\nFund is called for. It is essential that the work of the\nWorld Bank be aimed at supporting the genuine\nexercise by over 130 third world countries of their right\nto development. It is essential that the United Nations\nsystem be provided with new financial resources to\nfight poverty, underdevelopment, disease and famine. It\nis essential that the World Trade Organization be\nrescued from the interests of a handful of rich and\npowerful countries and transformed into an instrument\nat the service of a fair and equitable international\ntrading system.\nThe meagre results derived from the Monterrey\nand Johannesburg conferences and the justified wave\nof annoyance and uncertainty in their wake once again\nraise the issue of the lack of political will by the major\nindustrialized Powers to relinquish a portion of their\nprivileges in order to produce a real change in the\nunfair and unsustainable world order that is currently\nvisiting impoverishment and hopelessness upon two\nthirds of the planet's population.\nI recognize that Cuba's remarks may not be\naccepted by some in this Hall. I even understand that\nthey could be interpreted as a tirade against a country\nin particular. However, that is not the reason. Words\nmust be used to uphold the truth and that is what Cuba\nhas done and will always do. We are a small, noble\npeople that long ago proclaimed that, for all Cubans,\n\u201cmotherland is humankind\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me start by\ncongratulating the President on his unanimous election\nto preside  over the fifty-seventh session of the United\nNations General Assembly. His election is an honour to\nhim and to his country, the Czech Republic. The\ndelegation of the State of Eritrea assures you of its full\ncooperation and support.\nAllow me also to extend to his predecessor, Mr.\nHan Seung-soo of the Republic of Korea, my\ndelegation's deep appreciation for a job well done\nduring the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\nProfound appreciation is also due to our Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his tireless efforts to\nmake our United Nations more responsive and\neffective.\nOn this happy occasion, my delegation welcomes\nthe Swiss Confederation to the family of nations with\ngreat pleasure. We commend the decision taken by the\nSwiss people in allowing their great country to become\na full Member of the United Nations. The same words\ngo to the soon-to-be 191st Member of our\nOrganization, the Democratic Republic of East Timor,\na country whose sovereignty and independence has\nbeen won with sweat and blood, like that of my own\ncountry. Warm welcome from Eritrea, East Timor!\nThe fifty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly is taking place at a time when the wounds\nand scars from the 11 September terrorist attack one\nyear ago, in three locations over the soil of the United\nStates, are still healing. Grief, pain and anger are still\nlingering.\nAt a gathering here at Headquarters this 11\nSeptember to commemorate the first anniversary of the\nattack, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said,\n\u201cOn 11 September grief enveloped the\nworld, not only out of solidarity with the people\nof the United States, but out of shared loss. More\nthan 90 nations lost sons and daughters of their\nown \u2014 murdered that day for no other reason\nthan that they had chosen to live in this country.\nToday, we come together as a world community\nbecause we were attacked as a world\ncommunity.\u201d\nThe loss of almost 3,000 innocent lives in a single\nday is so painful. The Eritrean people share the pain\nand the grief. They reiterate their condolences to those\nwho lost their loved ones, and they stand in solidarity\nwith the American people at this trying time. Indeed,\nthe attacks of 11 September have inevitably changed\nthe way we live and the way we see our world. This\nday has symbolized the alarm clock that rung around\nthe world to wake us all. My delegation regrets that it\ntook attacks of such magnitude to shake us from our\nunwatchful sleep.\n22\n\nTerrorism is not a new phenomenon in my\ncountry. The State of Eritrea has suffered it since its\nformal independence, in 1993, as the youngest country\nin Africa. The Eritrean Islamic Jihad Movement and\nthe so-called Eritrean Popular Islamic Conference were\ncreated and sponsored by Al Qaeda and other regional\nand international Islamic groups to perpetrate\nsubversive acts in Eritrea for the last 10 years. In 1994,\nEritrean security forces intercepted a mixed group of\nterrorists that included in their ranks Al Qaeda-trained\nnationals from several countries. In 1995, this group\nmurdered four Belgian tourists inside Eritrea in cold\nblood. Sporadic cross-border acts of terror and\nsubversion continue to this day.\nIn a statement contained in document S/1997/517\nof 7 July 1997, my Government first warned the\ninternational community, and subsequently the then\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) and the Security\nCouncil, that international terrorist threats from\nextreme fundamentalist Islamic groups were on the\nway.\nThe Eritrean Jihad terrorist movements, which are\nmembers of the Al Qaeda network, are now part of the\nso-called Alliance of Eritrean National Forces. This\numbrella organization has bases and physical presences\nin some neighbouring, and a number of Western,\ncountries. These groups continue to obtain sanctuary,\nas well as financial and other forms of assistance, from\nWestern capitals.\nAs the fight against international terrorism\nassumes high priority and warrants concerted action,\nthe Government of Eritrea requests full cooperation\nand joint action from the countries where these terrorist\nelements live, plan and launch their operations. At this\njuncture, I also wish to reiterate to the Assembly that\nthe people and Government of Eritrea will continue to\nfight terrorism in all its forms.\nDespite the declaration by the 1999 Algiers\nSummit of the OAU to make the year 2000 the year to\nend conflicts and to start a new momentum for peace in\nAfrica, conflicts have continued to take a heavy toll on\nAfrican peoples in many countries of the continent.\nThis is indeed disappointing.\nI come from the Horn of Africa, a subregion\nwhere conflicts and wars have been a way of life for\nmany decades. The Horn of Africa is also a place that\nhas seen many misfortunes. Recurring conflicts over\npast decades have claimed hundreds of thousands of\nlives, displaced a staggering number of people and\nforced millions out of their countries to live as refugees\nin foreign lands.\nThe internal conflict in the Sudan is now the\nlongest running one in Africa. Under the framework of\nthe Inter-Governmental Authority on Development\n(IGAD), a subregional entity, the State of Eritrea,\ntogether with the other member countries, is doing its\nbest to bring about a resolution to this conflict. We\nhave come a long way in bringing the conflicting\nparties to face-to-face  talks. There are encouraging\nsigns, but we cannot congratulate ourselves yet. Our\nefforts may be considered a success once quieter days\nof peace, stability and sustained prosperity prevail in\nthat sisterly country. I must admit that we need the help\nof the international community to end the suffering of\nour brothers and sisters in the Sudan.\nIn the same vein, the problem in Somalia, another\nsisterly country in the Horn, continues to be a serious\none that the international community cannot ignore.\nThe vicious conflict in Somalia will have long-term\ncatastrophic humanitarian consequences if the\ninternational community abandons this unfortunate\ncountry. The United Nations and the world community\nat large must help the Transitional National\nGovernment of Somalia to stabilize peace and security\nin the country. The international community should\nrush to save Somalia.\nNow, on a positive note, let me tell the Assembly\nthe good news regarding the border conflict between\nmy country and Ethiopia. On 13 April this year, the\nEritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission, a panel of five\njudges established by the Algiers agreement, made a\njudicial ruling on the entire 1,000-kilometer border\nbetween the two countries. The people and\nGovernment of Eritrea are pleased to see a legal\nsolution to a conflict they never chose.\nMy Government believed from the very\nbeginning that this conflict could not be settled by\nmight, but by peaceful means alone. The pacifist A. J.\nMuste said it all: \u201cThere is no way to peace. Peace is\nthe way\u201d.\nThe Boundary Commission has drawn the new\nborder and is currently in the process of physically\ndemarcating the lines on the ground. Completion of the\ndemarcation is expected in the next few months.\nAccording to the Algiers agreement, which both\ncountries signed, the decision of the Commission is\n23\n\nfinal and binding. Eritrea has reiterated its acceptance\nof the Commission's decision of 13 April 2002. Eritrea\ntherefore believes that territorial claims and counter-\nclaims ended on that day. In legal terms, the conflict\nended then too.\nNow that the conflict has legally been put to rest,\nthe people of Eritrea want to leave this awful\nexperience behind them and move on with life afresh.\nAs Carl Bard said, \u201cThough no one can go back and\nmake a brand new start, anyone can start from now and\nmake a brand new ending.\u201d What matters is the\ndestination point. The people and Government of\nEritrea are committed to turning things around.\nAt the end of this saga, my delegation finds it\nfitting to pay tribute at the General Assembly to our\npeace-loving friends and partners who helped us to get\nhere. Allow me therefore to particularly thank the\nformer Organization of African Unity, now the African\nUnion; President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria; the\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan; the Government of the United States of\nAmerica; and the European Union. We are grateful to\nthem all for their valued efforts in this difficult and\nlong peace process.\nThe year 2002 saw five important international\ngatherings aimed at bringing peace, security, human\ndignity and economic prosperity to the peoples of the\nworld, big and small alike. Those meetings included\nthe International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment in Monterrey, the Second World\nAssembly on Ageing in Madrid, the special session on\nchildren in New York, the World Food Summit in\nRome and, lastly, the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment in Johannesburg. The promises and\ndeclarations of all these international events are tied in\nwith the goals of the 2000 United Nations Millennium\nDeclaration.\nAs we all know, those goals embrace the key\ndimensions of human development \u2014 related to\npoverty, hunger, education and health \u2014 stated as a set\nof time-bound targets. Those targets are: halving\npoverty and hunger, achieving universal primary\neducation and gender equality, reducing under-5\nmortality by two thirds and maternal mortality by three\nquarters, halting the spread of HIV/AIDS and halving\nthe proportion of people who lack access to safe water.\nWith 1990 as the base year, those targets are to be\nachieved by 2015.\nDespite the promises of globalization and the\nmany initiatives launched at various times to help the\ncontinent, Africa's economic growth is still lagging far\nbehind. The success of development in Africa still\ndepends on the political will of rich countries to\nprovide financial assistance, on the one hand, and on\nthe full ownership and effective execution of national\ndevelopment programmes by African countries\nthemselves, on the other.\nHaving said that, I shall now, for the benefit of\nour partners, reiterate the five core principles\nunderlying Eritrea's development strategy: first,\ndeveloping the capabilities of our people as the\nprincipal asset and driving force of our development\nendeavours; secondly, establishing strong public-\nprivate sector partnerships; thirdly, striving to achieve\nself-reliance and avoiding chronic and debilitating\ndependency; fourthly, protecting the environment from\nthe adverse effects of development programmes; and\nfifthly, establishing effective development partnerships\nwith multilateral and bilateral development agencies,\nwith Governments and with non-governmental\norganizations.\nI would be remiss if I failed to bring to the\nattention of the Assembly the looming drought that\nthreatens the lives of more than 1 million men, women\nand children in Eritrea. The failure of vital rains\nexpected in the months of April and May has put their\nlives at risk. Famine is imminent if international aid\ndoes not reach the Eritrean people soon. I wish to use\nthis occasion, therefore, to appeal to the donor\ncommunity to respond to this pressing humanitarian\nneed.\nIn conclusion, I wish to express my delegation's\nconfidence that, under your able leadership, Mr.\nPresident, the fifty-seventh session will see much\nsuccess.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to congratulate\nmy friend Mr. Jan Kavan on his election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly and to wish him\nsuccess. I also thank the Secretary-General for his\nleadership and his dedication to right what is wrong\nand to light the lamps of hope.\nThe eleventh of September gave rise to a new\nworld. We find ourselves facing a new confrontation:\nborderless, merciless, indiscriminate and inhumane.\nThe target this time was the United States \u2014 a United\nStates that in the past helped so many nations defend\ntheir freedoms and their liberty. Now the United States\nhas been challenged again to defend our freedom by\nprotecting its own and to safeguard our lives by\nsecuring its own.\nThe attack on the World Trade Center precipitated\na new division in our epoch and in the years to come \u2014\na divide created by groups that preach and cause death\nand agony. On the wrong side of the divide are those\nwho are trying to destroy the free world, which is\ndiversified and heterogeneous, cherishing the right to\nevery thought and religion as well as the principle that\nevery human being has the right to be different and yet\nto prosper and live in security.\n10\n\nThe front from Bin Laden to Saddam Hussein is a\nmenace to us all. It will not enable peace, nor will it\npermit freedom \u2014 for all people or for their own\npeople. In countries that harbour terror, women are\ndiscriminated against, men are oppressed, civil and\nhuman rights are violated, and the poor cannot escape\nfrom their poverty They force us to defend our\ninalienable right to look ahead with hope. They\nimposed on us a war of self-defence \u2014 the defence of\npluralism and of the promise of science. They reject the\nincredible technologies that may carry us from the\nlimits of land to the discovery of uncharted provinces.\nThe culture of death forces us to defend the culture of\nlife, to win battles that we did not initiate, to triumph in\nthis uninvited war.\nWe never imagined that it could be dangerous to\nwalk our streets, to fly our skies, to breathe the air or to\ndrink the water. We cannot agree to this. We cannot\nallow dark forces \u2014 which, as we are aware, could\ndestroy the lives of innocent people on a whim \u2014 to\npossess weapons of mass destruction. We shall not turn\nour lives into a series of sleepless nights and\nnightmarish days.\nWe do not have the right to ignore the danger. We\ndo not have the option to postpone it; it is imminent.\nWe have to win as soon as possible.\nTerror is destined to lose. It will be defeated\nbecause it carries no hope. It respects neither human\nbeings nor the values of humanity.\nScience and technology made the economy\nglobal, and science and technology globalized terror as\nwell. Now strategy also is globalized, because ballistic\nranges have replaced geographic distances, because\nnon-conventional warheads have replaced measurable\nexplosives, because terrorism transcends frontiers and\nfronts. Terrorists do not respect the rule of law. They\ndo not answer to independent judges or relate to\nelected leaders. They mock international lines. They\ndestroy universal norms. They shed blood. They\nintroduced dullness and stopped affluence. Nothing is\nto be expected from them but death.\nTerror creates poverty more than poverty creates\nterror. Terror leads to backwardness. We have to offer\nthe economic potential to open prospects and horizons\nfor all nations, poor and rich. New opportunities can\nbring enfranchisement. We have to close ranks to\nprevent distorted dreams from becoming a raging\ntyphoon that reaches all four corners of the globe. We\nhave experienced in our own country the terrible\neffects of terrorism.\nBabies were shot in the arms of their mothers.\nPeople at prayer were killed while praying. Yes, it hurt\nus, but it did not change our goals. We mourn, but we\ndid not bury peace.\nIt harmed the Palestinians in the United States\nand in other countries. It prevented the occupation\nfrom ending. It introduced additional problems and did\nnot solve a single existing problem.\nAlas, the Middle East is still replete with\nnational, religious and territorial disputes. The land is\nsmall; the agony is great. But the real tragedy is that\nwithout terror we could already have resolved these\ndisputes. Terror entrenched them. Terror changed\npriorities \u2014 security before policy. It affected\nresources \u2014 arming young men, for example, instead\nof desalinating vital water. If it continues, battlefields\nwill create deserts of sorrow and days of darkness.\nCampuses of learning will be replaced by camps of\nviolence.\nBut this is neither a decree of heaven nor the\nverdict of man. It can, it should, it will be different.\nSouth Africa, Ireland, Yugoslavia and the Congo\nachieved more by talking than by shooting, more by\ndialogue than by dispute. We offered the Palestinians a\ncomprehensive solution without the terror \u2014 a solution\nthat was close to their national aspirations. We related\nto their desire to be free, to be equal, to be\nindependent. We agreed that they would have their land\nin accordance with United Nations resolutions. But\nterror postponed their destiny. Terror postponed our\nwillingness to end control over their lives. Smoking\nguns replaced the torches of peace.\nNow we are following the profound debate taking\nplace among the Palestinians. We respect it, because\ndebate is the beginning of democracy. When\ndemocracy prevails, peace undoubtedly will arrive. The\nFatah organization apparently issued a call that\ncontains some new approaches. I shall quote one of\nthem:\n\u201cWe will build an independent State of\nPalestine and a political system in accordance\nwith the principles of democracy, the rule of law,\nwith an independent judicial system, separation\nof power, respect for human rights, civil liberties\nand a market economy.\u201d\n\n\nWe look upon these words as the dawn of a\ndifferent season; we hope that it is spring. Reducing\nviolence will shorten political distances. Political\nhorizons are, in my judgement, within reach. Israel\naccepts President Bush's vision. That vision is\nsupported by the Quartet; it is endorsed by Arab\ncountries; it outlines a political goal and a timetable. It\ncan be considered as both a road map and a calendar.\nWhat is needed now are wheels to propel the vehicles\nof peace. An economic wheel is needed in order for us\nto move to a global market economy that leads to\nscience-based industry. A market economy can open\ngates and skies. An ecological wheel is needed to let\nair and water flow cleanly. Pollution is not national; we\nhave to work together to control it. Ecology has\nchanged history. In the past, bloodshed was about real\nestate, and real estate created divisions, demarcation\nand, unfortunately, wars as well. In our era, the battle is\nnot for real estate but for air, for water and for energy;\nit is about the fertility of the land, rather than its size.\n\u201cNon-real\u201d estate is not marked, nor can it be divided.\nEither we respect it unanimously, or we will be\nvictimized by its loss.\nThen there is the cultural wheel. Three\ncivilizations were born in the Middle East. They were\nmade manifest in the Bible, in the New Testament and\nin the Koran. We read them in different languages, yet\nwe pray to the same heavens. The descendants of\nAbraham should behave like a family \u2014 with tolerance\nand solidarity. Spiritual leaders should pray for peace,\nbut they also need to preach it, call upon it and\ncontribute to it.\nThe political wheel should not rotate in the same\nmisguided orbit as in the past. We have been through\nfive wars in five decades \u2014 Palestinians, Egyptians\nand Jordanians lost generations of young people. We\npaid heavily with young blood as a result of three terror\ncampaigns. The time has come to comprehend that the\nreal triumph is in the harvest of peace, not in the seeds\nof another war. When we replace the war maps with\npeace maps, we will discover that the differences were\nminimal. The wars were appalling. We shall see that\nthe promised land could have become the land of\npromise a long time ago.\nWithout wars, our region will be able to bloom\nagain. We can separate politically into two States and\ncoordinate one economy. That will enable us to take\nadvantage of the exceptional invitation that came from\nboth the United States and a united Europe to partake\nin their economic opportunities.\nTourism can flourish when terrorism has ended.\nIslands of high-tech excellence can be established.\nMillions of trees can be planted to produce a new\nclimate. We can make green our arid lands. We can\nbecome contributors, not dependants.\nThe call of the future cannot be harmonized with\nthe voices of the past. Only new solutions can evoke a\ngrandeur equal to the past. We do not have the right to\nsuspend it in the face of our children. Young Israelis\nand young Palestinians are entitled to a new life \u2014 a\nlife of their own. While fighting terror, let us not fight\npeople. While seeking freedom, let us not extend\nsubjugation.\nI should like to direct a comment to Syria. The\nsame principle that enabled us both to participate in the\nMadrid conference a decade ago is still valid.\nA word to Lebanon: Israel is committed to the\nterritorial integrity of Lebanon. Israel respects its need\nfor real political independence. Lebanon should not\npermit Hezbollah to destroy its own country. Hezbollah\nis not a party, it is a dangerous agenda. Lebanon should\nimmediately free Israeli prisoners and prisoners of war.\nThe people of the Middle East should let bygones\nbe bygones. Let us return to our traditions, where\nprophets, not terrorists, told the future. Let us return to\nour landscape, where the blue skies did not surrender to\nthe heavy clouds of despair; to a time when justice\npromised equal opportunities for individuals and for\nnations. Let us join, together, the march of mankind\ntowards new discoveries that will make life more\npurposeful and may bring security to posterity.\nWe were born in the cradles of hope, not in the\ntombs of despair. We guard our spiritual heritage, and\nit is not antithetical to building a new Middle East. The\nworld is new.\nI should like to conclude with an old verse from\nour scriptures:\n\u201cThe Lord led Adam through the Garden of\nEden and said to him, \u2018All I created, I created for\nyou. Beware lest you spoil and destroy my world,\nfor if you spoil it, there is no one to repair it after\nyou'.\u201d\nWe are here to repair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me\nfirst to salute fellow leaders, whose tireless work and\n26\n\ntimeless commitment within and beyond the halls of\nthe United Nations help shape a more secure world for\nour peoples. Improving the human condition is a\ncharge to which we must remain resolutely committed.\nThis we can achieve only through meaningful\npartnership.\nLast year's efforts and the promise of\ncommunity-building should not be excluded from this\nyear's agenda. To build community partnership is\ncrucial; but, more importantly, we need equity. To fulfil\nexpectations of a better world, and to extract the lauded\nbenefits of globalization, much harder work is required\nto reduce the gap between rich and poor nations and\nthe haves and have-nots in our societies.\nHow can we explain the excruciating truths of a\nglobal marketplace where countries which are\ntechnologically deficient and heavily dependent on\nagriculture for their survival are encouraged, and even\ncoerced, into opening their economies and embracing\nfree trade, while larger and richer economies\nsystematically subsidize their domestic agricultural\noutput, mostly for political reasons, at a rate of\nbetween 22 to 60 percent annually.\nMr. President, your mandate this year \u2014 a very\ncritical one \u2014 will be to ensure that the peoples of the\nworld who suffer as a result of this inequity can truly\nrenew their faith in us and believe again in the values\nof the United Nations.\nMy delegation has said repeatedly that\nglobalization is not a bad thing. However, it continues\nto be managed badly. We insist that the current\nstructure of the global economy is inherently flawed. It\nserves to reward the powerful and to punish the weak.\nWhile we appreciate that our world is undergoing\nprofound and necessary changes, we cannot\ncountenance abandoning the principles and values that\nbind us within the human family and the family of\nnations.\nGlobalization, in our view, must include true\nuniversal equity in its application of shared\nresponsibility and good governance. The selective\nprocesses by which the agendas of the powerful few\nare advanced to the exclusion of the small, poor and\neconomically vulnerable States must be addressed with\na willingness to correct it. My delegation believes that\nthe United Nations is uniquely positioned to respond to\nthis challenge. Hence, my Government questions\nattempts to transform certain United Nations organs\nsuch as the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP) into advisory bodies, and away from\ndevelopment assistance, which poor developing\ncountries need now more than ever.\nThe United Nations must evolve as a dynamic,\nreceptive and representative body to stem the tides that\nthreaten us. It must build or strengthen social safety\nnets in many developing nations, not oversee processes\ngeared at dismantling them. We must recommit to\nimproving lives and to re-energizing our fight against\npoverty, hunger and ignorance. The United Nations has\na significant role to play in this endeavour. Improved\ncoordination of United Nations agencies is critical in\nachieving these objectives.\nMy delegation urges Member States to pledge\ntheir support, and hopes that they will, to ensure that\nthe three conferences sponsored by the United Nations\nthis year \u2014 the International Conference on Financing\nfor Development, the special session on children and\nthe World Summit on Sustainable Development \u2014 bear\nfruit. We remain hopeful that continued dialogue,\npartnership and the instrumentality of the United\nNations will enable us to make meaningful progress.\nA year has passed since the barbaric acts of\n11 September. The foundations of our world views\nhave changed dramatically, as has the way we look at\nourselves and at our commitment to personal, national\nand international security. Again, Saint Kitts and Nevis\nunreservedly denounces any act of terrorism, anywhere\nin the world. We do not believe that the indiscriminate\nkilling of innocent people as an expression of despair\nor oppression is an acceptable means of redress. We\nvalue highly the sanctity of life, and my Government is\ncommitted to its protection. We will work together in\nthe United Nations to find international solutions to\naddress this outrage. Let us ensure that the continuing\nwar against terrorism is waged within the structures of\ninternational institutions such as the United Nations.\nYear after year, we call on the international\ncommunity to join our noble campaign to halt the\ntrans-shipment of nuclear wastes through our\nCaribbean region, but this call goes unheeded. I\nreiterate our appeal today. Saint Kitts and Nevis urges\nsustained follow-up action to give meaning and life to\nthe United Nations resolution adopted in 2000\ndeclaring the Caribbean Sea a special area in the\ncontext of sustainable development.\n27\n\nRepresentation is crucial to the peoples of the\nworld, and, as my delegation has done in the past, I\nwish to re-emphasize the status of the people of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan. Membership in this\nOrganization is in itself a validation and celebration of\na people's fundamental human rights. We therefore\nlament the continued stalemate that results in the\nexclusion of the people of the Republic of China on\nTaiwan from the United Nations family.\nThe contribution of the 23 million people of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan to the global market, to\nthe international community in the areas of technology,\ntechnical assistance and development assistance is\nunmistakably significant. Its participation in\ninternational activities can rival, and in many instances\nsurpasses, that of many developed countries who are\nfull Members of the United Nations. It is unfortunate\nand most regrettable, therefore, that the United Nations\nhas been unable to create a meaningful and practical\nformula that would allow the Chinese people on both\nsides of the Taiwan Straits to resolve this impasse,\nwhich stymies the genuine hopes and desires of\nmillions of people who adhere to the principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter and whose nation is a model\ninternational citizen.\nWe have witnessed how involvement by the\ninternational community can facilitate positive\ndevelopments, such as the emergence of nationhood.\nOn behalf of my Government and in my own name, I\nwelcome East Timor to the United Nations family. I\nsalute it and its great leaders and pledge my\nGovernment's support in working with it in the years\nahead on issues of mutual interest and, of course, of\ninterest to the international fraternity of nations. I also\nextend a hand of welcome and friendship to the\nGovernment and the people of Switzerland. It has\nobserved the United Nations for many years, so it is no\nstranger to its proceedings. The Organization will\nbenefit greatly from its participation, and Saint Kitts\nand Nevis looks forward to collaborating with it in the\nfuture.\nThe incidence of HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean\nregion is a real and growing threat to our security at a\nnumber of levels. In human terms, it threatens to\ndevastate families and to create a generation of\norphans. At the economic level, it places a tremendous\nburden on the health resources of our countries and has\nalready begun to undermine the economic\ninfrastructure of our countries. The most productive\nand able-bodied are at risk, and those infected with the\ndisease are less and less able to contribute to the\neconomic activity and growth of their countries.\nInstead, they require medical and financial support.\nResources earmarked for other areas have to be\nredeployed to address the new pandemic.\nIt is clear that pharmaceutical companies and\nGovernments that support them can do much more to\nreduce the cost of antiretroviral drugs. Private-sector\ncompanies must also do more to assist employees and\nfamilies suffering from HIV/AIDS. It is regrettable that\nthe $10 billion in resources required by the Global\nFund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria are\nyet to be realized.\nSaint Kitts and Nevis repeats its call for new\nparadigms to redress the inequities of globalization. We\nurge the international community to develop\nappropriate frameworks to promote fundamental\nfreedoms as a comprehensive whole, not only in terms\nof political rights, such as the right to self-expression\nand the right to vote, but also the human right to\neconomic development. Only when we respond to the\ngenuine needs of humankind \u2014 only when the hungry\nare fed, the vulnerable made strong, the weak,\ndispossessed, disenfranchised and oppressed\nempowered and made to feel a sense of belonging, and\nwhen they are free to participate fully in issues relating\nto their future \u2014 can we have a world where anarchy,\nterrorism, inter-State conflicts and war recede.\nWhat we ask for is certainly attainable. We\nsimply call on the United Nations to facilitate systems\nwhere partnership, collective responsibility and respect\nfor each other are allowed to flourish. This is possible\nonce States realize that national policies in a global\neconomy have international consequences. Politics may\nstill be local, but when we take action locally we must\nremember that we are also global citizens. Thus, a\nprincipal goal of globalization should be to level the\nplaying field to provide equal opportunity. Strategies,\nas a consequence, should reflect confidence-building\nmeasures for free trade and sustainable development.\nIn conclusion, let me say that the United Nations\nhas stood firm for peace, prosperity and security for all\npeoples. It has done much to ensure peace and justice\nthroughout the world, consistent with the principles of\ninternational law. It has set itself lofty goals for this\nmillennium: basic education for all, eradicating\npoverty, reducing HIV/AIDS, and ensuring sustainable\n28\n\ndevelopment for all. Our people and, indeed, all\ncitizens of the global community pray that the political\nwill will be found to translate those lofty goals into\nreality on the ground. Positive action, rather than\neloquent speech, must become the defining quality of\nthe United Nations in the third millennium.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn addressing this\nhonourable Assembly, I first wish to convey the\ngreetings of the people of the Republic of Vanuatu. Our\nfuture will be determined by the nations represented\nhere today.\nI also take this opportunity to congratulate you,\nSir, on your assumption of the presidency of the fifty-\nseventh session of the General Assembly. You have\nassumed the presidency during a turbulent period in\ninternational relations, and my delegation pledges its\nfull support and cooperation to you, as you guide this\nnoble Organization through this difficult time. I also\ntake this opportunity to acknowledge with deep\ngratitude the contributions of your predecessor, who so\ncompetently steered the work of the fifty-sixth session\nof the General Assembly to its conclusion.\nI acknowledge with much gratitude and\nadmiration the outstanding leadership and diplomatic\nskills of Secretary-General Kofi Annan. His\noutstanding wisdom has made it possible for the United\nNations to maintain its credibility and relevance not\nonly in maintaining international peace throughout the\nworld, but also in ensuring that this Organization\ncontinues to address the development challenges\nconfronting the world, including Vanuatu.\nI am pleased to welcome the Swiss Confederation\nas a Member of the United Nations. I am looking\nforward to the imminent admission of the Democratic\nRepublic of Timor-Leste, a nation where Vanuatu was\nhonoured to have participated in the United Nations-\nadministered peacekeeping process.\nThe deeply disturbing events of 11 September\nwill remain etched in our memories for a long time. On\nbehalf of the Government and people of Vanuatu,\nI have the solemn duty of conveying to the\nGovernment and people of the United States of\nAmerica, including the families of the innocent victims\nof 11 September 2001, our sincere condolences for the\nmany innocent lives lost on that fatal day of the most\ninhuman act of modern history. The barbaric and\ncowardly acts of 11 September have shaken the\nfoundations and principles on which this Organization\nis built. They have ushered in a new period of global\nuncertainty.\nTerrorism has become the scourge of our time.\nThis complex phenomenon has scarred our planet. As\nresponsible members of the international community,\nwe must work closely together in order to eradicate it.\nHowever, any action of reprisal or punitive measures\nmust receive universal support through established\nmultilateral and international structures, beginning\nwith the United Nations, the most universally\n2\n\nrepresented organization. It is very dangerous to take\nany action outside such mechanisms. We request that\nall actions undertaken must, above all, serve the\npurpose of guaranteeing justice, peace and security in\nthe future world.\nIn particular, we call upon the initiators of a\nmilitary action against Iraq to show great wisdom and\nresponsibility to ensure that their decisions do not\ncreate a new world order of insecurity, hatred and\nconflict, defined by cultural, ethnic and religious\ndivisions. All actions taken must be consistent with the\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter\nand established international law.\nAlthough the fight against terrorism has taken\ncentre stage, it must not lead us to forget or to neglect\ndevelopment issues and security concerns inherent to\nthe developing world, in particular, to the small island\nStates. Some resources will inevitably be reallocated to\nthe growing problem of security, but it must not\novershadow the development agenda of the developing\nworld. It is in that context that my delegation wishes to\nassociate itself with the statements made by other\nPacific island countries in endorsing the Pacific Islands\nForum declarations that have been distributed as a\nUnited Nations document.\nThe recent World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment held in South Africa unambiguously\nreminded us that much remains to be done in\naddressing the challenges inherent to the world's many\ndeveloping economies. The environment and the\nnegative impact of climate change are of extreme\nconcern, and we urge those countries that have not yet\ndone so to ratify the Kyoto Protocol as soon as\npossible. The ratifications of Japan, the European\nUnion, China and Russia have been most welcome.\nThe aggressive policies of developed countries\ncontinue to marginalize many of the world's very small\ndeveloping economies, such as that of Vanuatu.\nBinding commitments to international declarations and\nlegislation are the cornerstone of a peaceful and just\nworld in which justice prevails above all. There must\nbe equitable partnerships and cooperation so that we\ncan all contribute our support and confidence.\nWhile small nations, such as Vanuatu, are being\nforced to comply with conditions imposed by\ndeveloped countries, some of those same nations\ndecide at the same time to impose policies that\nencroach upon national and regional positions.\nVanuatu is firmly opposed to the proliferation of\nnuclear weapons in all their forms. In that context, my\nGovernment once more unreservedly condemns the\nongoing transfer of radioactive materials in the Pacific\nOcean. The flagrant disregard for national and regional\nopposition is a clear demonstration of the policies of\nthe powerful. That negligence is shameful in the light\nof the many ideals and principles espoused by this\nOrganization and its various entities. Given the recent\nadoption of the Pacific Islands Regional Oceans Policy\nat the Pacific Islands Leaders Forum in the Republic of\nthe Fiji Islands, I strongly call on the shipping States to\nrespect the efforts of the Pacific Island countries to\nsafeguard their principal resource: the sea.\nThe conditions imposed by the powerful with\nrespect to the initiatives of the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are\nanother clear demonstration of the game of the\npowerful, in which we see the big nations manipulating\nthe world order to their own advantage. Those\nabominable policies affect the very boundaries of\nnational sovereignty for the benefit of the developed\ncountries. We must put an end to all this hypocrisy, if\nwe, the small nations, are to be treated fairly and as\nequal partners in the international community.\nVanuatu opposes discriminatory policies and\nlegislation which expose our vulnerability to a very\nvolatile global environment. Some of our national\nefforts to stimulate economic growth are being stifled\nby the enormous pressure exerted by the club of the\nrich, which does everything to ensure that their\nposition prevails. Where does that leave us? I must\nstress this because Vanuatu has done its best to comply\nwith the OECD initiatives, including through\nlegislation to prevent money-laundering and to ensure\ntransparency in financial transactions. Yet, that rich and\ninfluential organization continues to put forward\nfurther demands. We are ready to negotiate within a\ntime-frame that must first suit our economic and\npolitical requirements. But the OECD must, in turn, be\nready and able to provide immediate relief and\nsolutions. Any decision by the OECD to blacklist\ncountries such as Vanuatu is premature and\nunwarranted. It would serve the interests of the OECD\nalone. Vanuatu is confronted with a dilemma because\nthe countries that introduced the tax-haven policy\nduring the colonial period continue to place\nunreasonable demands on our already weak economy.\n3\n\nOn that note, I must also mention the complicated\nand extreme difficulties that my country is facing as it\nstruggles through its reform process. Given the\nestablished millennium priorities, there is still an acute\nshortage of financial assistance necessary to effectively\nimplement national development priorities. We have\nbecome accustomed to receiving plenty of foreign\nadvice that is, unfortunately, not backed up by real\nfinancial support. That has placed an extreme burden\non the already scarce resources available in the\ncountry. I believe that it is important that our\ndevelopment partners try to better understand the\nparticularities and unique characteristics of not only\nVanuatu but also other small and fragile economies of\nthe Pacific islands.\nThe existing ban on exports of kava to Europe\nand the United States is another indication of the unfair\nand discriminatory policies practised by the powerful\nnations. We expect that other countries will, in turn,\njoin the ban. However, there is no scientific evidence to\njustify those trade sanctions, which have impacted\nnegatively on the economy of Vanuatu. We therefore\nseek the support and understanding of the international\ncommunity in order to allow time for the adequate\nscientific research to be carried out before such trade\nrestrictions are imposed. Kava products exported to\nEurope and other destinations are mixed with non-kava\nproducts. For the moment, it is completely unfair and\ndiscriminatory to impose such a ban.\nMy Government fully supports the efforts to\nreform the United Nations system in order to create a\nstronger and more efficient organization. On this issue,\nmy delegation endorses the position of other\ndelegations on the need to restructure the membership\nof the Security Council so that it may better reflect the\ngeographical representation and the under-represented\ngroups of Member States without affecting the\nCouncil's authority.\nThe question of Taiwan must also be adequately\naddressed here. Resolution 2758 (XXVI), adopted by\nthe General Assembly in 1971, resolved the legal and\npolitical representation of the People's Republic of\nChina as a Member of the United Nations. Therefore,\nany attempt by Taiwan to gain admission to the United\nNations or to any of its affiliated organs or special\nagencies will not be supported by my Government. The\nUnited Nations must ensure that it does not become\ninvolved in the conflict between China and Taiwan,\nwhich is a matter totally within China's purview.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to\nmention the problem of West Papua. At the Millennium\nSummit, the then-Prime Minister of Vanuatu touched\non the important matter of the principle of self-\ndetermination for the people of West Papua. The\nquestion of West Papua has always occupied a special\nplace on Vanuatu's foreign policy agenda. The Charter\nof the United Nations espouses the principles that\ncontinue to guide the Organization's efforts with regard\nto self-determination. We are completely convinced\nthat, if the United Nations is to be consistent in its\ndecisions to promote recognition and respect of the\nfundamental right to self-determination, the question of\nWest Papua must be placed on the agenda of the\nSpecial Committee on the Situation with regard to the\nImplementation of the Declaration on the Granting of\nIndependence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. The\nclosed-door policy with regard to the pleas of West\nPapuans continues to undermine the credibility of the\nUnited Nations in terms of its ability to address an\nessential matter. I think it is in the best interests of the\ninternational community that the question of West\nPapua be revisited. We also request that a commission\nof inquiry be deployed to verify information on\natrocities alleged to have been committed in West\nPapua.\nIn conclusion, we must continue to support the\npivotal role of the United Nations in efforts to create a\njust and equitable world. We must stem the growing\ngap between the developed and developing worlds in\norder to guarantee economic and social prosperity for\nall \u2014 a critical prerequisite to guaranteeing political\nstability, peace and security throughout the world. The\neffective implementation of the United Nations agenda\nfor development, in particular the Millennium\nDeclaration and the Monterrey and Johannesburg\nDeclarations, will advance that process. A more\nfavourable international environment will assist the\ndevelopmental priorities of developing countries and\nwill address the great economic imbalances prevailing\ntoday. True goodwill, respect, tolerance and equality\nwill be necessary if we are to move forward. The role\nof the United Nations will be crucial in that process,\nbut only if support is forthcoming from its Members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe\ntragic events of 11 September 2001 awakened the\ninternational community to the gravity of a new\nmenace to world peace and security. The lighting of the\neternal flame during the commemorative service in\nBattery Park was mirrored by the outpouring of\nsympathy from around the globe and the world became\none again, reaching out to those who lost their loved\nones on that fateful day.\nThe global community responded promptly and\ndecisively to the scourge of terrorism. Over the past\nyear, international cooperation has been strengthened\nin our relentless campaign against terrorism. The\nSecurity Council, in particular, has played a\ncommendable role in this process through its Counter-\nTerrorism Committee. The Republic of Korea has been\nan active member of the international coalition against\nterrorism. We are now working with other countries to\ncontribute to the rehabilitation of Afghanistan.\nAs we conduct our resolute fight against\nterrorism, we should also consider that deprivation,\nlack of good governance and marginalization from the\nprocess of globalization can serve as a breeding ground\nfor fanatics who can go so far as to take their own lives\njust to harm others. The international community\nshould, therefore, take a holistic approach, while\nbearing in mind at all times that terrorism cannot be\njustified by any cause or under any circumstances\nwhatsoever.\nThe events of 11 September have also brought\nhome to the world the appalling dangers of weapons of\nmass destruction falling into the wrong hands.\nMoreover, the prevailing international reality\nunderscores the urgent need to make progress in\ndisarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction.\nIt is essential that we achieve universality of non-\nproliferation regimes  including the Treaty on the\nNon-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the Chemical\nWeapons Convention and the Biological Weapons\nConvention  while ensuring full compliance by all\n18\n\nStates parties to such regimes. We also hope that a total\nban on nuclear testing and fissile material production\nwill be achieved through the early entry into force of\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and an\nexpeditious conclusion of a fissile material cut-off\ntreaty. In that regard, I would like to underline the\nRepublic of Korea's full commitment to strengthening\nmultilateral collaboration to promote the cause of\ndisarmament and non-proliferation.\nSince its inception, the United Nations has played\na key role in securing peace and stability in the\ntroubled corners of the world. Indeed, the work of the\nUnited Nations in conflict prevention, peacemaking,\npeacekeeping and peace-building has expanded in\nrecent years.\nEast Timor is the latest success for which the\nUnited Nations deserves praise. As a Member State\ncommitted to the coalition of the willing, the Republic\nof Korea has actively taken part in the United Nations\nefforts in East Timor and other parts of the world.\nMoreover, our overall financial contribution to United\nNations peacekeeping operations has grown\napproximately tenfold over the past three years. The\nRepublic of Korea intends to strengthen its\ninvolvement in these crucial United Nations activities.\nThe Korean peninsula is still one of the world's\nmost volatile areas. Nevertheless, President Kim Dae-\njung's unwavering pursuit of his engagement policy is\nfundamentally reshaping inter-Korean relations. That\nengagement policy is, in essence, a strategy for peace\nthrough engagement, designed to cope with the\nmultiple challenges inherent in inter-Korean relations\non the road to eventual unification. As such, it aims at\nfostering inter-Korean reconciliation, promoting\ncooperation and exchanges, reducing tension and\nbuilding durable peace on the peninsula.\nThe highlight of the engagement policy was the\nholding of the historic summit between South Korea\nand North Korea in June 2000. The summit set in\nmotion an inter-Korean peace process. After ups and\ndowns along the way, the peace process is finally back\non track and moving forward again. Inter-Korean\nmeetings at various levels have resumed, as have\nexchanges in all areas. In fact, on this very day, at\nMount Kumgang, the fifth round of reunions between\nseparated family members is taking place. Next week,\nSouth Korea and North Korea will hold the long-\nanticipated ground-breaking ceremonies marking the\nstart of construction work for the reconnecting of\nrailways and roads that have remained severed for five\ndecades. Since those projects literally involve a\nbreakthrough in the heavily fortified border and require\na certain level of military-to-military cooperation, they\nwill hold not only great practical benefit but also\ntremendous symbolic significance. As we look ahead to\nthe completion of the trans-Korean railway, this clearly\npromises to have far-reaching interregional\nimplications for accomplishing the vision of an iron\nsilk road, a rail link joining Asia and Europe.\nThe overall progress report to date amply\ndemonstrates that the engagement policy works. The\nKorean people on both sides of the peninsula today\nenjoy a stronger peace than ever, and the risk of war is\nat an all-time low since the end of the Korean War, in\n1950. However, it is not yet time to be complacent, as\nwe have still a long way to go if the peace process is to\nprove irreversible and fully sustainable.\nOne important challenge to the peace process\nrelates to the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction. We continue to believe that the 1994\nGeneva Agreed Framework holds the best hope for\nremoving concerns over nuclear proliferation from the\nKorean peninsula. However, at the moment, the Agreed\nFramework has reached a critical juncture. As the light\nwater reactor project progresses, it is now essential that\nfull cooperation with the International Atomic Energy\nAgency begin without further delay for the\nimplementation of the safeguards requirements of the\nAgreed Framework.\nThe path to world peace runs through more\nequitable economic and social development. In that\nregard, we attach great importance to the United\nNations Agenda for Development and, in particular, to\nthe implementation of the United Nations Millennium\nDeclaration. The International Conference on\nFinancing for Development, held in Monterrey in\nMarch of this year, was a success in the area of\nenhancing shared awareness of the primary\nresponsibility of developing countries themselves, as\nwell as in emphasizing the need for more substantial\ninput from developed countries. The Political\nDeclaration and Plan of Implementation adopted at the\nrecent World Summit on Sustainable Development are\nalso of great significance, as they have set out a time-\nbound plan of action for humanity's quest to preserve\nthe planet for posterity. The unprecedented advances in\ninformation and communication technologies are also\n19\n\nwidening the gap between the front runners and those\nwho lag behind. We hope that the United Nations and\nother relevant international organizations will become\nmore proactive in bridging the digital divide between\ndeveloped and developing nations.\nThe last century witnessed the steady advance\nand triumph of democracy and human rights as\nuniversal values around the globe. As it has been so\neloquently put, liberty, when it begins to take root, is a\nplant of rapid growth indeed. The human rights\nsituation in any given country is no longer an\nexclusively domestic affair. The issue of human rights\nhas become a priority agenda item for the international\ncommunity. During the last session of the General\nAssembly, special attention was paid to the human\nrights of such vulnerable groups as children and the\nelderly. We sincerely hope that the pledges made at the\nSecond World Assembly on Ageing, as well as at the\nspecial session on children, will be translated into\nconcrete action.\nThe Republic of Korea has a firm commitment to\ninternational cooperation for the promotion of\ndemocracy and human rights. We plan to host the\nsecond Ministerial Conference of the Community of\nDemocracies in Seoul in November of this year. We are\nworking with other Convening Group countries to\nensure that this proves a momentous occasion in the\nprotection, consolidation and advancement of\ndemocracy the world over. We also welcome the\nrenewed commitment of the international community\nto combat such growing problems of horrific\ntransnational crime as the trafficking in persons.\nOver the past half century, the United Nations has\nmade outstanding contributions to causes of great\nimportance to humankind. However, the world body\ncannot possibly meet all expectations. Given the\nlimited means and resources available to it, the United\nNations should focus on areas in which it can excel,\nmaking the best use of its comprehensive mandate and\nthe universality of its membership. In that regard, the\nRepublic of Korea strongly supports the ongoing\nreforms that Secretary-General Kofi Annan has been\npursuing with a view to achieving a more effective and\nefficient United Nations.\nIn closing, I would like to say that the United\nNations is the embodiment of globalism and the\nepitome of multilateral cooperation. As such, the\ninternational community looks to the United Nations\nfor guidance and effective action in the whole spectrum\nof areas under its mandate.\nThe Republic of Korea reaffirms its firm\ncommitment to working in concert with other Member\nStates to make the United Nations more relevant and\nefficient, and thus better able to meet the challenges\nahead  global challenges indeed.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy warmest\ncongratulations go to you, Sir, on your early election as\nPresident of the General Assembly, which was the first\nfruit of the revitalization efforts of your predecessor,\nMr. Han Seung-soo. We congratulate both of you on\nsuccessfully implementing these new procedures.\n9\n\nAfter the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001,\nthe world joined the United States in expressing grief\nand outrage. Citizens from nearly one half of the\nUnited Nations Member States perished. A swift,\ndetermined United Nations response set the stage for a\nunited global effort to weed out terrorism. Never in\nrecent history have so many States acted in such unison\nas members of one international community as they did\nin the months following 11 September.\nThat was not inevitable. The international\ncommunity could easily have fractured after 11\nSeptember . Hence, it is useful to reflect on the forces\nthat brought us together and on what key lessons we\nhave learned.\nAfter 11 September 2001, the international\ncommunity rallied together because we all realized that\nthe challenges posed by those events affected the\ncommon interests of all States. The common menace of\nterrorism elicited a cohesive psychological response.\nEveryone is vulnerable. In Singapore, we discovered\nterrorists belonging to a regional network with links to\nAl Qaeda, whose tentacles spread to Indonesia,\nMalaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and even Australia.\nIts targets were United States, Israeli, British and other\nforeign interests.\nBut a cohesive response also requires a\ngalvanizing force. The United Nations provided that.\nThe United Nations also legitimizes international\naction. On 12 September 2001, the Security Council\nadopted, by consensus, its resolution 1368 (2001),\ncondemning the terrorist attacks and expressing its\nreadiness to take all necessary steps to respond to the\nattacks. It was followed shortly by a consensus\nresolution of the General Assembly, resolution 56/1.\nWithin three weeks of the attack, the Security Council\nnegotiated and adopted, again by consensus, its\nresolution 1373 (2001), a landmark resolution which\ndealt comprehensively with counter-terrorism and\nprovided a common legal basis for all States to take\naction against terrorists and their supporters.\nThe Security Council's response to 11 September\nwas impressive and was possible only because all the\nmajor Powers agreed on the need to respond decisively\nto the terrorist threat. Indeed, the war on terrorism has\nreordered international priorities and has created new\nopportunities for partnership, casting a new strategic\noverlay over great-Power relationships.\nTerrorism is not a new phenomenon. Many of us\nhave long had unhappy experiences with it. But 11\nSeptember focused us on its globalized nature and\nstressed the need for coherence and coordination in\ninternational cooperation. After 11 September, a\nnumber of international, regional, subregional and\nnational plans of action and strategies to combat\nterrorism emerged. Some of these proposals took the\nform of specific and practical counter-terrorism\nmeasures. Others assumed a more normative character.\nThese efforts are the building blocks for coordinated\ninternational action against terrorism.\nThis commitment to collaborative international\naction, however, has only recently begun to take shape.\nSince 11 September, various organs of the United\nNations system have examined their respective\nresponsibilities and available tools so as to undertake\nthis collaborative mission in the most effective manner.\nThe report prepared by the Policy Working Group on\nthe United Nations and Terrorism is a clear example.\nCoordination and coherence within the United Nations\nsystem should certainly be enhanced. The common\nenemy we face has built up a sophisticated and\ncomplex global network that requires an appropriate\nresponse.\nBut as we consider new international mechanisms\nto fight terrorism, we should pause to reflect on a key\nquestion: how can we ensure effective coordination\nbetween the United Nations, other regional and\ninternational organizations and Member States? How\ncan we synergize respective international, regional and\nnational competencies to maximize operational\neffectiveness against terrorism? The United Nations\ncomparative advantage and aptitude reside in its\nconsultative, coordinating and facilitative functions.\nUltimately, however, the contributions made by\nthe United Nations must depend on the political will\nand resolve of its Member States to make its laws and\nnorms work. Achieving the right equilibrium of\nresponsibilities and obligations is crucial if we are to\nsucceed in our common mission to defeat international\nterrorism.\nThe battle against terrorism has also to be fought\nat the philosophical level. Some terrorists have tried to\ndepict the current global anti-terrorism campaign as a\nwar against Islam. This is obviously not true. No\nreligion tolerates terrorism, and Islam certainly does\nnot, but we should not ignore the extent to which the\n10\n\nappeal of extremists such as Osama bin Laden\nresonates with the marginalized and disenfranchised,\nfeeding upon stereotypes and prejudices. At a time of\nconfusion and uncertainty, the value of cross-cultural\nunderstanding and communication cannot be\nunderestimated.\nAs an international Organization with near\nuniversal membership, the United Nations can play a\nkey role in promoting tolerance and understanding\nbetween nations, cultures and religions. The United\nNations dialogue among civilizations is a key initiative\nthat we should build upon. The dialogue among\ncivilizations celebrates diversity and introduces a new\nparadigm of international relations, promoting a\ndialogue among the major world religions and cultures.\nDialogue between the different cultures and religions\nwould help to reduce the sources of prejudice and\nintolerance that currently colour individual and societal\nperceptions.\nAnother longer-term challenge is to address the\neconomic and social conditions that encourage\nterrorists. International economic integration is\nultimately the only guarantor of prosperity, but the fact\nis that globalization is both incomplete in scope and\nuneven in its distribution of costs and benefits. Many\ndeveloping countries remain imperfectly integrated into\nthe world economy. These problems must be addressed\nby capacity-building and infrastructure development\nwithin developing countries, with whatever\ninternational assistance is necessary, and by the\nelimination of trade barriers and protectionism in the\ndeveloped countries.\nThe events of 11 September underscored that, in\nan interdependent world, no one is invulnerable. Local\nproblems can easily be transformed into global\nproblems. Each day that we do not act to address and\ncontain these problems increases their potential to do\nmore harm. Our collective security is dependent on our\nability and willingness to confront new challenges. We\nshould not await another catastrophe on the scale of 11\nSeptember before we are forced to act on other equally\nchallenging global problems that confront us. The war\nagainst terrorism has to be waged with both guns and\nbutter.\nI would like to conclude by sharing our\nexperiences on the Security Council. Almost two years\nago, members of the General Assembly gave Singapore\nthe honour and privilege of serving as one of the\nelected members of the Security Council. Our term\nends this December. I want to thank all those who\nshowed their trust in us by giving us this unique\nopportunity.\nOur experience has been a fulfilling and\nenriching one from which we have drawn important\nlessons and insights. The Security Council has gone\nthrough many phases. Designed first of all to deal with\ninter-State conflicts, the Security Council has\nincreasingly moved towards handling intra-State\nconflicts in the post-cold-war era. But the terrorist\nattacks of 11 September were an unprecedented\ndevelopment. They produced a new era, confronting\nthe Security Council with a new and distinct threat to\ninternational peace and security. Singapore has\ntherefore served in two very different Security\nCouncils  one before 11 September and another after\nthose tragic events.\nFor the Security Council to remain effective, it\nhas to demonstrate that it can respond effectively to\nnew challenges. Otherwise, its relevance and\ncredibility will be compromised. As a small State, we\nare vulnerable to such terror attacks. As a member of\nthe Security Council, we have supported initiatives\nwhich address this new threat.\nA key lesson that we have learnt is that, for all its\nimperfections and occasional failings, the Security\nCouncil often does work. It is nevertheless too early to\ngauge the success and effectiveness of the Security\nCouncil in responding to the scourge of terrorism.\nWhether the Security Council can continue to develop\nappropriate responses over the long run at this plastic\nphase of the creation of a new strategic era will be a\ncritical test of its relevance in the new century.\nIt is naive to expect that the swift unity of global\naction post 11 September will henceforth be\ndemonstrated on all global issues. Our experiences in\nthe Security Council attest to protracted processes\nbeing the norm rather than the exception for coalescing\ninternational action. But where international consensus\nhas not yet consolidated over situations posing serious\nand immediate threats, the lack of international\nconsensus in itself cannot be an excuse for inaction.\nThat would be an abdication of individual and\ncollective responsibility.\nFinally, as one of two Asian elected members of\nthe Council, we were pleased to make a small\ncontribution to the East Timor success story. This\n\n\nsuccess was made possible only by the hard work and\nsacrifices of its people, with the support of the\ninternational community. Today, the United Nations\ncontinues to play a critical role in preserving the peace\nin East Timor and in ensuring that the Government and\npeople of East Timor have the opportunity to succeed\nin their quest to build a democratic, stable and viable\nState. We look forward to welcoming East Timor as the\n191st Member of the United Nations.\nLet me conclude by warmly congratulating\nSwitzerland for becoming the 190th Member of the\nUnited Nations. Switzerland may be a new member;\nhowever, it has also provided the second most\nimportant venue for United Nations activities. It has\ntherefore long been a partner of the United Nations\nand, I believe, this partnership will be deepened with\nits membership.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI\nam pleased to convey to Mr. Jan Kavan the warm\ncongratulations of my Government on his election as\nPresident of the fifty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly. We equally extend our congratulations to\nthe other members of the Bureau. We assure them that\nthe Ivorian delegation will spare no effort in making its\ncontribution to the success of this session.\nWe would be remiss if we did not mention here\nthe tremendous work of His Excellency Mr. Han\nSeung-soo, former Minister for Foreign Affairs of the\nRepublic of Korea, who, with his great experience led\nthe difficult fifty-sixth session to a positive conclusion,\nof which we are all aware. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is grateful for\nthat. A reconciled C\u00f4te d'Ivoire conveys its fraternal\ngreetings to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, with\nparticular thanks for his tireless efforts. It is a great\npleasure for my Government to welcome and\ncongratulate the Swiss Confederation upon its\nadmission as a State Member of the United Nations.\nMembers will agree with me that the fifty-sixth\nsession was a very difficult one. How can we forget the\nsad memory of 11 September 2001, which will cast a\nshadow over the work of our Organization for a long\ntime to come. This session in particular, as it\nimmediately follows the fifty-sixth, must learn all the\nappropriate lessons from the last session and provide a\nnew dimension to international relations.\nIn the opinion of the delegation of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire,\nthe renewed need to recast multilateral inter-State\nrelations can be articulated, inter alia, around the\nfollowing themes: United Nations reform; a steadfast\nfight against poverty; human rights; and international\nsecurity.\nIt has become a truism to say that if the United\nNations had not existed, it would have had to be\ninvented. After more than 50 years of existence \u2014 and\nthis has been recognized over and over again \u2014 on the\ndawn of the third millennium, the United Nations\nwould do well to shake off the dust and adapt itself to\nthe new times.\nAlong these lines, for almost 10 years we have\nseen negotiations on reform of the membership and of\nthe working methods of the Security Council. It is time\nfor specific measures to be taken so we may have a\ncomprehensive debate based on the positions of the\nvarious regional groups. For our part, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is\nconvinced that two permanent seats and three non-\npermanent seats for the African continent would be in\nkeeping with the times. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is ready to make\na contribution to any resolution or decision which\nwould help modernize the Security Council.\nFor 30 years following the Second World War, the\npriorities of the international community were such\nthings as reconstruction, decolonization and the cold\nwar, to name a few. Nowadays, misery and poverty,\nwhich appeal to human conscience, are, as far as we\nare concerned, the number-one threat to international\npeace and security.\nThe greater the gap between rich and poor\ncountries, the more emigration there will be to the rich\ncountries, whose forecasts and development\nprogrammes will then be undermined. Contrary to what\nsome might think, in the opinion of my delegation the\nfight against poverty is an essential component of\npreventive diplomacy. Both inside and outside a given\ncountry, the fight against poverty is the prime operation\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security.\nMy Government has understood this, and we have\ndecentralized our administration through the\nestablishment of district councils. Now it is up to the\n58 administrative districts to identify their own needs,\nto establish their priorities and carry out their\ndevelopment projects financed from the annual budget\nunder the appropriate national legislation.\nWith respect to the financing of a decentralized\nadministration, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire takes this opportunity to\nthank its developmental partners for their aid and\nsupport, and we appeal to the international community\nto make additional contributions to our decentralization\n15\n\npolicy. I reaffirm that C\u00f4te d'Ivoire has enormous\npotential and, now more than ever, offers extraordinary\nopportunities for investment and partnership.\nWe welcome the results of the International\nConference on Financing for Development, which was\nheld at Monterrey from 18 to 22 March 2002, as well\nas the World Summit on Sustainable Development,\nheld in Johannesburg, and the 2001 Doha meeting of\nthe World Trade Organization. We would like to see the\nconclusions of those three important meetings turned\ninto concrete action.\nWe cannot repeat it enough: the efforts of\ndeveloping countries will be in vain unless measures\nare taken to ease the debt burden and unless the\ninternational community succeeds in preventing the\nnegative effects of globalization.\nAfter the fall of the Berlin wall, the market\neconomy became part of the economic standards of the\ninternational community. This new economic\nunderstanding means more than ever that we must\nabandon the logic that says that we should have, on one\nhand, those who produce only raw materials and, on\nthe other, those who produce only finished products. To\nenable the developing countries to enter the industrial\nage and have access to markets throughout the world,\nwe need a better organization of international\nsolidarity, and scrupulous respect for the resolutions\nthat have been adopted.\nIn the opinion of my delegation, with the\nimplementation of the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment (NEPAD), Africa now offers a favourable\nframework for the exercise of international economic\nsolidarity. NEPAD must remain a programme that\nassists the African Union, and not a new overlapping\ninstitution. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is happy to see the\nestablishment of the African Union, and it will play its\nrole in consolidating this unique tool of international\ncooperation.\nWhile we welcome the progress realized in the\npromotion and protection of human rights, C\u00f4te\nd'Ivoire is still deeply concerned about issues relating\nto the right to health. My delegation would like to\nreturn to the question of HIV/AIDS which, more so\nthan malaria, is the number-one public health problem\nthroughout the world. According to the Joint United\nNations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO), in 2001 40 million\npeople throughout the world, 58 per cent of them\nwomen, were infected by the HIV virus. Of the 40\nmillion people who are HIV-positive, nearly 29 million\nlive in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease is progressing,\nand in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire it is especially hitting the most\nactive segments of the population, namely the 14-to-45\nage group.\nIn spite of the many praiseworthy efforts made by\nC\u00f4te d'Ivoire, which has also pledged to implement a\nuniversal health insurance system, and those made by\nthe international community in its fight against the\nHIV/AIDS pandemic, the results do not yet meet\npeople's expectations. As we await a miracle cure for\nthe mutant AIDS virus, more than ever we have to\nredouble our efforts regarding prevention on the one\nhand, and access to medicine for the neediest segments\nof society on the other. It is also important that the\nstruggle be waged within the framework of ongoing\ninternational coordination, which is the only guarantee\nof success, and that decision-makers show more\ninterest in implementing the outcomes of such\ncoordination.\nPeace and the security of goods and persons are\nthe alpha and omega of any development. While the\nend of the cold war seemed to justify a certain\nsatisfaction, we must recognize that recent events do\nnot give us much reason to rejoice. The destruction of\nlight weapons in a few places should not let us ignore\nthe submerged part of the iceberg. In spite of pledges\nmade, the sale of light arms in particular continues to\nprosper, with the resulting child soldiers and disabled\npeople, not to mention all the refugees and the\nhomeless fleeing conflict areas.\nThe United Nations Conference on the Illicit\nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its\nAspects, which was held last year, delivered some\nconclusions which were generally accepted by\neveryone. My delegation hopes that very soon a report\nof the Secretary-General will enable us to assess the\nresults of that Conference to date.\nIn terms of nuclear weapons, the key event of the\npast two years was the end of the 1972 Treaty on the\nLimitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems between\nthe two greatest nuclear Powers. This situation is of\nconcern to C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Therefore, my country is very\nhappy to see that in the framework of a new agreement\nrecently signed by the United States of America and\nthe Russian Federation, those two nuclear Powers have\ndecided on a two-thirds reduction of their nuclear\n16\n\narsenals over a 10-year period, zero level being the\nultimate objective to be achieved as soon as possible.\nLike other countries in the international community,\nC\u00f4te-d'Ivoire has taken note of this major event, and\nencourages the two parties to pursue their efforts\ntowards a total reduction of the nuclear threat.\nHere, my delegation would like to thank,\ncommend and encourage France, our long-standing\npartner, which for the last three years, through its\nvigorous policy of disarmament, has significantly\nreduced its nuclear arsenal.\nLet me reaffirm the position of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire on\ndisarmament, which does not differ from the position\nof the group of non-aligned countries. It is imperative\nthat everyone respect the non-nuclear zones established\naround the world, including the one created in Africa\nunder the Pelindaba Treaty.\nThe events of 11 September 2001 were an\nappalling atrocity which caused the immediate loss of\nlife of more people than ever in the history of terrorist\nattacks. Our objective should be to avoid a repetition of\nsuch attacks through concerted action, supported by the\nappropriate means. To combat this scourge, in our\nopinion, we must grasp the problem at its roots and\nunderstand all its political, economic, psychological\nand moral components. So that we do not play into the\nhands of the terrorists, the fight against terrorism\nshould help bring peoples together. Therefore, the\nsimultaneous dialogue among civilizations and cultures\nmust inspire the action of the international community.\nC\u00f4te d'Ivoire has taken legal and economic measures\nto combat terrorism. It has set out to collaborate with\nother parties and to develop specific legislation to fight\nagainst terrorism by defining and punishing infractions.\nMy country will continue to assume the\nobligations of international solidarity against terrorism,\nas laid out in Security Council resolution 1373 (2001).\nTo do this, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire wishes to have, in addition to\nthe financial and logistical means it sorely lacks, the\nsupport of the international community with regard to\ntraining in the legal, banking and police areas. But no\nmatter what, my Government will continue its\ncooperation with the Security Council Counter-\nTerrorism Committee, so that the fight against\ninternational terrorism will yield results which will\nhelp us preserve international peace and security.\nThe crisis which has shaken the Middle East for\ndecades is without a doubt a serious threat to\ninternational peace and security. The persistence of this\ncrisis is a challenge that appears to expose the\nimpotence of the international community to deal with\na conflict that, if we are not careful, could come to be\naccepted as commonplace. Yet we can at least say that\nsince the start of the conflict, the international\ncommunity has not folded its arms. Indeed, the United\nNations resolutions on the questions are innumerable.\nThe best known of them are Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 and 338\n(1973) of 22 October 1973, resolutions supported by\nsuch forums as the Oslo and Madrid Conferences.\nAt the centre of the conflict are the inevitable\nissues of the need for the Palestinians to have a viable\nindependent State, and of the need for the State of\nIsrael to live in security and in peace with all its Arab\nneighbours, within internationally recognized borders.\nThat is why it is important to welcome the Saudi\ninitiative which recognizes Israel's right to exist next to\na Palestinian State.\nIn that regard, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is very happy to\nembrace Security Council resolution 1397 (2002) of 12\nMarch 2002, in which the Council, with the\nconcurrence of its five permanent members, affirmed a\nvision of a region where two States, Israel and\nPalestine, live side by side within secure and\nrecognized borders.\nIn Africa, we are happy to see the return of peace\nin Sierra Leone, in Eritrea and Ethiopia, and in Angola.\nWe must thank the political leaders of those States and\nall others who, one way or another, contributed to the\nend of hostilities in those countries. We call on them to\nhelp in the ongoing process of reconciliation and\nreconstruction.\nWhile we welcome those positive developments,\nwe are concerned by the ongoing hostilities in Liberia,\nthe Sudan, Somalia and the Great Lakes region. We\nmust all support the initiatives and the efforts of well-\nknown individuals such as former President Nelson\nMandela and President Bush, and those of the\ninternational community, particularly the United\nNations, the African Union, the Economic Community\nof West African States (ECOWAS) and the Southern\nAfrican Development Community (SADC), for the\nreturn to peace and stability in this large region of our\ncontinent.\nWe urge all the sons and daughters of the region\nto understand that the return of peace and\n17\n\nreconciliation depends first of all on them. Only their\nwill peacefully to settle their disputes, whatever their\nnature, will make it possible to put an end to the\nsuffering of their peoples.\nThanks to the intelligence and good will of its\npeople, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire has been able to reconcile and\nfind an Ivorian solution to its recent political\ndifficulties. It encourages all parties to conflicts to\nhave confidence in themselves and in their ability to\nfind appropriate solutions to the issues that divide\nthem, in the interest of their populations and,\nultimately, that of Africa.\nI would like in conclusion to state that while the\nUnited Nations has \u201cpushed back the frontiers of\nracism\u201d (A/49/PV.14, p. 7), to quote former President\nNelson Mandela, it can, with genuine political will,\nachieve equally impressive results in other areas. We\nmust thus do everything we can to push far back the\nfrontiers of hatred, intolerance, violence and poverty or\nindeed to destroy those evils. Let us build a better\nworld, a world of peace and progress for ourselves and\nfuture generations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, allow me to congratulate\nMr. Jan Kavan on his election to the most prestigious\npost of President of the fifty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly. My delegation is fully confident\nthat his skilful leadership will bring success to this\nsession.\nI wish to avail myself of this opportunity also to\ncongratulate the outgoing President, Mr. Han Seung-\nsoo of the Republic of Korea, for his tireless efforts\nand dedication in performing his duties.\nThe United Nations community has recently\nbecome richer with the admission to its membership of\nthe Swiss Confederation. Though the valuable\ncontribution of that country to the goals of the United\nNations was undisputed even before its formal\nmembership, I congratulate the Swiss Federation on\nthis decision. We are also looking forward to East\nTimor's joining the Organization, which will take place\nsoon.\nThe heinous acts of 11 September 2001, which\nstruck New York, Washington and Pennsylvania, have\nbrought the international community to a critical\njuncture, where it is faced with an ultimate challenge:\nhow to find a way to successfully cope with the\nindiscriminate effects and devastating consequences of\nacts of international terrorism.\n18\n\nThe promptness with which the world reacted and\nthe solidarity expressed through the broadest coalition\never against terrorism was exemplary. The United\nNations took the lead in combating international\nterrorism. The Republic of Macedonia, itself a victim\nof terrorist aggression, has joined the international\ncoalition and is making its contribution to this end.\nTwo days ago, on Sunday, 15 September, my\ncountry held, for the fourth time, free and democratic\nelections. They marked the progress achieved over the\npast year, and the fact that they went smoothly\nreaffirmed our commitment to democracy and to the\nrule of law. They also reaffirmed the maturity of\nMacedonian society, its Government and its citizens,\nthus once again establishing its position as an equal\nand respected member of the European family.\nOur elections  an outstanding democratic\nachievement  are clear proof that all along\nMacedonia has been seeking political and democratic\nsolutions. They represent an outstanding example of\nthe fact that democracy, elections and political freedom\nare the most effective mechanisms for a society and its\nneeds, and the most efficient answer to violence as an\ninstrument for achieving political goals.\nTerrorism has more than once proved itself not\nonly an unworthy ally, but also a dangerous\nbedfellow  one that always turns against those who\nuse it in their pursuit of social change or justice.\nTherefore, there must be no double standards\nwhen dealing with political extremism and terrorism,\nbecause, as we have proved, there is not one issue that\ncannot be dealt with politically, or, better yet, through\nelections and dialogue, as we have done.\nThe crises in recent history have shown more\nclearly than ever the importance of cooperation and\nsolidarity among the countries of our region, as well as\nthe importance of developing regional collective\nsecurity mechanisms in South-eastern Europe.\nMacedonia, for its part, is making every effort to make\nits contribution to strengthening cooperation within\nvarious regional organizations and initiatives. Further\nimprovement of good-neighbourly relations remains\none of the priorities of the foreign policy of the\nRepublic of Macedonia.\nAllow me in this context to reiterate our firm\nstance as to the need for the full implementation of\nSecurity Council resolution 1244 (1999) concerning\nKosovo. The Republic of Macedonia has provided\ncontinuous support for the efforts of the international\ncommunity and has always met the requests of the\nUnited Nations Interim Administration Mission in\nKosovo (UNMIK) and KFOR in regard to the\nsuccessful fulfilment of their mandate. We support the\nUNMIK policy of benchmarks' and believe that it\nwill facilitate the building of a democratic, multi-ethnic\nsociety and strengthen the rule of law in Kosovo.\nLet me recall here the agreement on delineation\nand demarcation of the border between the Republic of\nMacedonia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,\nwhose implementation on the ground is to start soon.\nAt this point, let me stress that efforts aimed at\nundermining the validity of the Agreement, such as the\nones we witnessed early this year by the local self-\ngovernment and Assembly of Kosovo, should be\ndefinitively rejected and nullified. In that sense, we\nsupport the reaction of the Security Council, which\ndetermined that this action was null and void.\nThere are still many challenges ahead of us in the\nregion. All of our goodwill and efforts to provide\nsustainable stability will not yield results unless we\nseriously address the real problems present in the\nregion as a consequence of 10 years of wars and\ninstability. Organized crime, various forms of\ntrafficking in drugs, arms, human beings and so on,\nwhich most often spur extremism and terrorism, have\nnot been adequately taken into account. National\nmeasures do not suffice to eliminate these phenomena.\nStrong involvement and support on the part of the\ninternational community is also indispensable.\nAllow me to inform the Assembly that the\nRepublic of Macedonia will once again this year\nsubmit a draft resolution on the maintenance of\ninternational security, good-neighbourliness, stability\nand development in South-eastern Europe. The draft\nresolution addresses the complexity of the problems of\ndisarmament, stability and development in this region.\nThe combat against terrorism must not distract us\nfrom other important issues on the United Nations\nagenda. The Millennium Summit and the Secretary-\nGeneral's road map towards the implementation of the\nUnited Nations Millennium Declaration have both\nidentified the direction of future United Nations\nactivities, to which we commit ourselves: the\neradication of poverty, the struggle against AIDS,\nconflict prevention and protection of the environment.\n19\n\nThe draft resolution will address the complexity of the\nproblems of disarmament, stability and development in\nthis region.\nThe struggle against terrorism must not detract\nfrom other important issues on the United Nations\nagenda. The Millennium Summit and the Secretary-\nGeneral's road map towards the implementation of the\nUnited Nations Millennium Declaration (A/56/326) go\nhand in hand in identifying the direction of future\nUnited Nations activities, to which we commit\nourselves: the eradication of poverty, the struggle\nagainst HIV/AIDS, conflict prevention and the\nprotection of the environment.\nGlobalization remains one of the most important\nissues on the international agenda. It is obvious that\nthere are some essential problems that need to be\naddressed immediately. In the new millennium, it is\ncrucial that the international community address the\ndevelopment agenda in a more comprehensive way and\nimprove the status of the protection of and respect for\nother fundamental human rights and freedoms. In that\ncontext, the implementation of the goals set at the\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment and at the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment  together with the special session on\nchildren, the most important events of the United\nNations this year  require the strong political will\nand commitment of Member States during the\nforthcoming review period. In that regard, I wish to use\nthis opportunity to welcome the United Nations\nDeclaration on the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment adopted yesterday by the General\nAssembly as resolution 57/2.\nThere is a need to build stronger partnerships\nwith other relevant organizations beyond the United\nNations system, such as the World Trade Organization\n(WTO), the World Bank and the International\nMonetary Fund, as well as with the business\ncommunity, non-governmental organizations and\nothers, in order for them to be closely engaged in the\nprocess. The fact that every fourth State Member of our\nOrganization is classified as least developed is\ncertainly no credit to any of us. That is why this issue\nmust be given the highest priority.\nOn disarmament matters, while the United\nNations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms\nand Light Weapons in All its Aspects and the adopted\nProgramme of Action marked a significant first step at\nthe global level towards preventing, combating and\neradicating the illicit trade in small arms and light\nweapons, we believe that there is a need for an\nenhanced follow-up process. The problem of small\narms and proliferation has been a particular concern of\nthe Republic of Macedonia and the broader region. It\nposes a serious threat not only to my country's security\nand stability, but also to the region at large. Therefore,\nit is necessary to take strong action to combat the illicit\nflow of small arms and light weapons.\nStrengthening the role and relevance of our\nOrganization should remain a topical issue on the\nUnited Nations agenda. Additional efforts should be\nmade particularly to strengthen United Nations\npreventive and peacekeeping capacities.\nMaking progress on issues of equitable\nrepresentation and reform of the Security Council is no\nless important. We are looking forward to the\ndeliberations this year of the Open-ended Working\nGroup, aimed at achieving meaningful progress\ntowards making the Security Council more\nrepresentative and transparent, while preserving and\nimproving its effectiveness for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and stability.\nThe Republic of Macedonia has from the very\nbeginning been a strong supporter of the establishment\nof the International Criminal Court (ICC) and was one\nof the first 60 States to ratify the Rome Statute, which\nentered into force on 1 July 2002. We support the\nefforts of the ICC to become truly universal, while\nbelieving that the concerns expressed regarding the\npossibility of politically motivated prosecutions can be\naddressed in a way that will not compromise the spirit\nof the Court.\nThe world today faces new challenges.\nUndoubtedly, the most important is the redefinition of\nthe very essence of international relations. That effort\nto instil new values is questioned by regimes and rogue\nleaders who belong to the past and who, contradicting\nprogress, have survived.\nWe are, at this moment, all mesmerized by the\ndevelopment of events surrounding Iraq and the Middle\nEast as a whole. Problems like these demand solutions.\nMany measures are being considered today, but they\nmust be based on a common conviction that our main\ntask is to construct a new and better world and that\nthese extraordinary steps are not our primary goal.\n20\n\nTherefore, it is the firm conviction of the\nRepublic of Macedonia that our most important tools\nmust be dialogue and mutual understanding. We know\nthat very well. The Republic of Macedonia  being at\nthe heart of the Balkans and of South-Eastern Europe,\nwhere over centuries various cultures and civilizations\nhave left many traces, where Christianity and Islam\nhave struggled for dominance and where ethnicities\nhave become interwoven  had every reason to\nsupport the proclamation of 2001 as the United Nations\nYear of Dialogue among Civilizations. As a follow-up\nand a practical contribution implementing the Global\nAgenda for Dialogue among Civilizations, the\nRepublic of Macedonia will host in November of this\nyear, in Ohrid  a World Heritage city of the United\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization  a regional forum on dialogue among\ncivilizations, the first gathering of that kind in the\nregion of South-Eastern Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe recognized leadership of Mr. Jan Kavan\nwill guarantee the success of our debates. Together\nwith congratulating him on his election to the\npresidency, I should like to assure him that he can\ncount on my Government's full cooperation in his\nwork.\nI come to this universal forum on behalf of a\npeople which last November renewed its commitment\nto democracy. Representing the constitutional\nGovernment headed by Mr. Ricardo Maduro Joest, who\nhas made the welfare of his people the essence of his\nmandate, I come with a message of peace and\nfriendship from Honduras addressed to all the nations\ngathered here.\nMy country's Government, born of the will of the\npeople through a free and transparent election regarded\nas a model, has in a few months brought about changes\nthat have strengthened Honduran democracy. It has\nimplemented historic institutional reforms, such as the\ndepoliticization of the Supreme Court of Justice, the\ndisallowing of participation in the presidential election\nfrom positions of political advantage, the creation of a\nhigher accounting tribunal to exercise overall monetary\ncontrol, and the depoliticization of the national\nelectoral tribunal. Moreover, it has developed civil\nsecurity schemes and measures that are effective and\nrespectful of human rights, all within a context of\ntransparency in administrative management and a head-\non campaign against corruption and extreme poverty.\nAs a Government, we are doing what we\nresponsibly must do, and in that work we wish to\ncontinue to rely on the friendly and respectful\nassistance of the international community, to which we\nlikewise offer our solidarity and cooperation.\nMoreover, I come to the Assembly with the firm\n37\n\nresolve to associate my country with the efforts of all\nMember States to realize fully the purposes and\nprinciples of the San Francisco Charter. I come to the\nOrganization also to offer my Government's\ncooperation in the building of peace, in the\nmaintenance of international security and in the forging\nof a global alliance for human development.\nThe day 11 September 2001 is an indelible date in\nthe history of humanity. The unprecedented terrorist\nattacks changed for ever the face of New York, the\niron Babel', which, despite its great sorrow and grief,\ncontinues to offer us its hospitality. Thousands of\nfamilies belonging to many peoples of the United\nNations, including mine, were plunged into grief and\npain on that fateful day. Our condolences and solidarity\nare with them.\nAs it did on that tragic occasion, the Government\nof Honduras condemns terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations. Accordingly, I take this opportunity to\nreaffirm in this world forum our unswerving\ncommitment to use all our skill and energy to combat\nthis scourge that threatens civilized coexistence among\nnations. With the same conviction, Honduras reaffirms\nits resolve to cooperate with other democratic nations\nin the common undertaking to eradicate this evil, thus\nbuilding a better and less violent world.\nSince 11 September 2001, many things have\nchanged. However, other threats persist and continue to\nloom over our peoples, making increasingly imperative\nthe quest for new consensus and greater commitments.\nFollowing the Millennium Summit, three conferences\nat the highest level and of the most far-reaching\nimportance have been held in recent months. Our heads\nof State or Government met first in Monterrey to\nconsider the issues of financing for development, later\nin Rome to address the problem of world hunger and,\nmost recently, in Johannesburg to debate the great\nchallenges of sustainable development. From each of\nthose conferences, we have emerged moderately\nsatisfied in terms of concrete results. However, we\nrecognize that the dialogue must continue so that we\ncan together seek new forms of cooperation to alleviate\nthe hunger and pain of a large part of humanity, whose\nvery survival is in danger as a result of the vortex of\neconomic development taking place at the cost of the\nplanet's destruction.\nAll of those commitments demand a United\nNations revitalized in its action and strengthened in its\ninternal structure. The time has come to reconsider\ncreatively and with greater determination the\norganizational structure of the Security Council, an\norgan that cannot continue to turn its back on a reality\nis very different from that of 1945. Honduras will not\nrest in its insistence on the need to abolish or restrict\nthe right of veto enjoyed by some Members of the\nOrganization. Likewise, my country believes that the\nStates contributing to development should have a seat\nand participate in the debate and work of that important\nUnited Nations organ.\nThe time has come to join in our resolve to seek\nmechanisms and decisions that will secure the full\nparticipation of all the peoples and nations of the Earth.\nIt is time for those who have been Members of the\nOrganization to return. For that reason, Honduras\nbelieves that we should not continue the practice of\nexcluding from our debates and our work concrete\nrealities such as Taiwan, a country whose participation\ncould offer new opportunities for cooperation for the\nbenefit of many peoples, and which, in turn could\nbenefit from our activity and decisions.\nIn essence, Honduras pleads for a new United\nNations in which all peoples and nations enjoy full\nrepresentation and in which there is more just and\nbalanced representativity in the discussions and in the\nresultant resolutions. In this context, Honduras\nwelcomes the accession of Switzerland and the\nincorporation of Timor-Leste into our world\nOrganization. I take this opportunity to wish them the\nwarmest of welcomes.\nIn the broad and comprehensive vision of what, in\nmy Government's opinion, this Organization should be,\nspecial mention must be made of the International\nCourt of Justice, since it is the jurisdictional organ of\nthe United Nations system and all States Members have\ncommitted themselves to complying with its decisions\nin the cases to which they are party.\nJust as Honduras endorses the principles and\npractices of international law that promote human\nsolidarity, respect for the self-determination of peoples,\nnon-interference and the safeguarding of universal\npeace and democracy, we also proclaim the validity\nand compulsory application of international arbitration\nand judicial rulings to be irrevocable. Consistent with\nthis state philosophy, my country is absolutely\nconvinced that compliance with international rulings\nhanded down by a competent international court, as\n38\n\nwell as good-faith compliance with the commitments\nundertaken by means of treaty, will guarantee peace,\nharmony and security among peoples and\nGovernments.\nHonduras feels that the very credibility of a\ncountry is at stake when it complies or fails to comply\nwith the obligations arising from an international\nruling. As for Honduras, the resolution of a competent\ninternational court has constitutional weight and its\neffects require immediate execution, for we believe\nthat law and legality are unshirkable imperatives of the\nnew international order. Moreover, in my\nGovernment's opinion, they are the cornerstone of\ninternational society in this century.\nPrompted by this conviction, in January my\ncountry turned to the Security Council, in its capacity\nas guarantor of the implementation of the rulings of the\nInternational Court of Justice, in seeking the requisite\ncooperation to ensure compliance with the ruling that\nthe Court handed down 10 years ago in the dispute\nwhich, by common agreement with the Republic of El\nSalvador, we submitted to it for consideration and\ndecision. Recent events in our countries have led us to\nbelieve that the implementation of the ruling will begin\nvery soon as a result of talks between the Presidents of\nthe two nations. We sincerely hope that this may be the\ncase, both because we do not wish to distract the\nSecurity Council's attention from this matter, which is\nof importance to our peoples and to the validity of\ninternational public law itself, and because we wish to\npromote the process of integration to which the whole\nof Central America is now committed.\nThe Central American isthmus is going through a\nspecial moment in its history. There is a resolve among\nour Governments to grasp the future together and,\naccordingly, we have agreed to promote the creation of\na customs union among the partners of the regional\nintegration system, which should be established by\nDecember 2003. This renewed integration, as we call\nit, offers opportunities both for our collectivity and for\nour neighbours and partners in development, as in the\ncase of Mexico with the Puebla-Panam\u00b7 plan.\nImportant challenges are also being met in concert,\nsuch as the negotiation of a free-trade treaty with the\nUnited States of America. We intend later to repeat the\nexperience with the European Union.\nDespite the significant progress that has been\nmade, and as in other regional systems of States,\npractices persist that impede the full development of\nour trade relations. Fortunately, we are striving to\novercome these obstacles through dialogue and\nsolutions appropriate to civilized nations which\nunderstand that, given our common past, we share a\ncommon future.\nAt the present time, there are grounds for grave\nconcern in the face of events and realities that threaten\ninternational peace and security. The situation in the\nMiddle East has been a constant cause of concern to\nall. Honduras appeals to the men and women of that\nregion to repudiate and renounce violence and thus\ngive peace a chance for the sake of a generation of\nchildren who see and experience nothing but violence\nas they grow. This and other bloody conflicts require us\nto rethink and reformulate new ideas for prompt action.\nWe need to globalize solidarity and human\ndevelopment. The great challenges of this century\nrequire us to increase the worldwide presence of the\nUnited Nations Development Programme, the World\nFood Programme, the World Health Organization, the\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization, the United Nations Environment\nProgramme and other entities and agencies of our\nsystem, whose work effectively contributes to\nestablishing the conditions to ensure that all boys, girls,\nmen and women of all ages, regardless of their ethnic\norigin, colour or religious creed, may live in an\nenvironment conducive to the full exercise of their\nrights.\nIn this context, the peoples of the world are\ncalling for concerted action on the part of our\nGovernments to make the United Nations the world's\nmost efficient Organization for addressing the\nchallenges posed by the millions of men, women and\nchildren infected by the HIV virus; by others, suffering\nunemployment, who have entered the most destitute\nsectors of society; and by the more than 40 million\nboys and girls who wander or simply live on the\nstreets.\nOver time, crimes against humanity have\nmotivated concerted action on the part of all peoples to\ndevelop new and advanced schemes for international\nprotection. That is the case with the new International\nCriminal Court, to which Honduras is honoured to be\nparty. We applaud this revolutionary effort in the\nadministration of criminal justice and hope that, sooner\n39\n\nrather than later, all the States Members of the United\nNations will join it.\nI wish to conclude my statement by emphasizing\nthat the great challenges we face in today's world\ndemand concerted and global action. If we truly wish\nto see the planet survive and, with it, the human race,\nthe time has come to work together responsibly to\nforge real partnerships for human development and\nsustainable development for all the peoples of the\nUnited Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the\ndelegation of Uganda, I congratulate you, Sir, on your\nelection to preside over the deliberations of the fifty-\nseventh regular session of the General Assembly. We\nexpress appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Han\nSeung-Soo, for a job well done. We also congratulate\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the\noutstanding work he continues to perform on behalf of\nthe United Nations and the international community.\nUganda welcomes to the membership of the United\nNations two new members, the Democratic Republic of\n5\n\nEast Timor, which is soon to become a Member, and the\nSwiss Confederation, whose admission to the United\nNations brings closer to realization the goal of\nuniversality of membership of this global Organization.\nOne year after the tragic events of 11 September\n2001, the primary role of the United Nations to maintain\ninternational peace and security must be strengthened, in\norder to ensure that the tragedy that befell New York City\nand Washington D.C., last year is not repeated anywhere\non this globe. The United Nations, together with all\nMember States, must make every effort to eradicate the\nscourge of terrorism from the world. The Government\nand people of Uganda stand united with all peace-\nloving countries of the world in condemning and\nresisting acts of terrorism carried out by cowardly and\nbarbaric forces. The use of indiscriminate violence\ncannot be justified under any circumstances and,\ntherefore, must be roundly condemned.\nThe people of Uganda have been victims of\nsenseless acts of terrorism perpetrated by terrorist\ngroups such as the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and\nthe Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) for many years.\nUganda is committed to efforts to bring the\nperpetrators of terrorism and their collaborators to\njustice. Uganda is ready to cooperate with other\ncountries in the implementation of the provisions of\nexisting international anti-terrorist conventions, as well\nas the conclusion of new international instruments to\ncounter terrorism comprehensively.\nAt the domestic level, Uganda recently enacted a\nlaw called the Suppression of Terrorism Act. The\nenactment of that law is clear testimony to the\ncommitment of the Government of Uganda to fight\nterrorism both at home and abroad.\nThe scourge of conflicts on the African continent\nhas for decades been one of the major contributors to\nsocio-economic decline, causing untold suffering, as\ncivilian populations are forced into living as refugees\nand internally displaced persons.\nBearing that in mind, we welcome the historic\ndecision of the inaugural Assembly of the African\nUnion to establish the Peace and Security Council of\nthe African Union to deal with the scourge of conflicts\nin Africa and to ensure that peace, stability and\nsecurity prevail on the African continent. Uganda has\nduly signed the Protocol relating to the establishment\nof the Peace and Security Council. As a collective\nsecurity and early-warning body, the Peace and\nSecurity Council will enhance Africa's capacity to\nmanage conflicts by facilitating timely and efficient\nresponse to conflict and crisis situations on the\ncontinent. I wish to call upon our development partners\nand upon the international community at large to\nsupport Africa in this new endeavour.\nIn conformity with our commitment to restore\npeace and stability in the Great Lakes region, and\nconsistent with the spirit of the Lusaka Ceasefire\nAgreement, the Presidents of Uganda and the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo signed an Agreement in Luanda,\nAngola, on 6 September 2002. That agreement provides\nfor total withdrawal of Ugandan troops from the territory\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo, normalization\nof relations and cooperation in the economic and social\nfields. Under the Agreement, Uganda undertakes to\nwithdraw all its troops from Beni, Gbadolite and Bunia\nwithin a period of 100 days. As of now, we have\nwithdrawn all our troops from Beni, and by the weekend\nwe shall have no troops in Gbadolite. At the same time,\nthe two countries agreed to establish a joint security\nmechanism for the western slopes of the Rwenzori\nmountains in order to address Uganda's security concerns.\nAlso of importance is the undertaking by the parties to\nrefrain from all types of military and logistical support\n\u2014 including the provision of bases and sanctuary to\narmed groups, inter-ethnic militias, subversive\norganizations and all rebel movements \u2014 against each\nother. Uganda is indebted to the Government of The\nRepublic of Angola for its crucial engagement, which\nled to that breakthrough.\nAs Chair of the regional initiative on Burundi,\nUganda has played a leading role in efforts to find a\njust and lasting solution to the internal conflict in\nBurundi. We welcome the conclusion of the Arusha\nPeace Accord, and I should like to appeal to all the\nparties to honour the ceasefire and to support fully\nefforts to implement the Arusha Accord. I thank, in that\nregard, the Governments of South Africa, Tanzania and\nGabon for their tireless efforts. In addition, we pay\ntribute to former President Nelson Mandela of South\nAfrica for his role as Facilitator. Uganda and the other\ncountries in the region will continue to exert every\neffort to bring about peace and stability in Burundi. We\ncall upon the United Nations and the rest of the\ninternational community to support our efforts to\nrestore peace in Burundi.\nSince the Nairobi Agreement, signed in\nDecember 1999 between the Governments of the Sudan\n6\n\nand Uganda and facilitated by former President Jimmy\nCarter of the United States and by President Daniel\narap Moi of Kenya, relations between Sudan and\nUganda have continued to witness steady and\nsatisfactory progress. To date, the Sudan and Uganda\nhave agreed to restore cooperation in the political,\nsecurity and diplomatic fields. We have also agreed to\nestablish a joint ministerial commission to oversee\nfurther cooperation in all areas.\nUganda strongly supports and is actively\nparticipating in the negotiations initiated by the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development aimed at\nresolving the conflict between the Government of the\nSudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/\nSudan People's Liberation Army (SPLM/SPLA), which\nculminated in the breakthrough of the Machakos\nProtocol on 20 July 2002. Indeed, it was in the spirit of\nhopeful anticipation of peace that President Museveni\nhosted a historic meeting in Kampala on 27 July 2002\nbetween President Al-Bashir of the Sudan and the\nChairman of the SPLM/SPLA, Dr. John Garang de\nMabior. Therefore, it is extremely unfortunate and\nregrettable that the second phase of the Machakos\nnegotiations between the two Sudanese parties has\nstalled. The Government of Uganda calls upon the\ninternational community, especially the countries of the\nregion, to demand a return to the negotiating table by\nthe Sudanese parties so that a comprehensive, just and\nlasting settlement can be reached.\nThe situation in Somalia continues to be volatile\nand the prospects for peace elusive. Following the Arta\nagreement and the formation of the Transitional\nNational Government of Somalia, the position of Uganda\nhas been to encourage the reconciliation process and an\nall-inclusive and broad-based administration for that\ncountry. It is in that context that Uganda looks forward to\nthe convening of the forthcoming Somali peace and\nreconciliation conference, which is due to start in\nNairobi, Kenya, on 15 October 2002.\nUganda is concerned at the lack of progress in\nefforts to find a just and permanent solution to the\nquestion of Western Sahara, which has remained\nunresolved since the former colonial Power abandoned\nthe territory in 1975. We urge the United Nations to\nhold, as soon as possible, a referendum to enable the\nSaharawi people to exercise their inalienable right to\nself-determination, in accordance with the relevant\nGeneral Assembly resolutions.\nUganda supports the right of the Palestinian\npeople to a homeland, and we appeal to the two parties\nto resume negotiations with a view to finding a just and\nlasting solution to the Middle East crisis. Uganda\nsupports the establishment of a Palestinian State to\nexist side by side in peace with the State of Israel.\nUganda participated actively and at the highest\nlevel at the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment, held at Johannesburg, South Africa. The\nSummit was clearly one of this year's major events in\nthe field of development. Uganda welcomes the\noutcome of that conference, which reaffirmed the\nprinciples and priorities of Agenda 21. In focusing on\npoverty eradication, the Summit established the\nessential integration of the three concepts of people,\nplanet and prosperity. We believe that the challenge\nnow before the international community is to\nimplement, fully and expeditiously, the concrete\nagreements reached at the conference. This session of\nthe General Assembly must, therefore, translate the\naspirations of the developing countries expressed at the\nconference into reality. We believe that all countries\nhave an obligation to implement the Johannesburg Plan\nof Action and Declaration on sustainable development\nand, by so doing, to contribute towards the achievement\nof the Millennium Development Goals, adopted by the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-fifth session.\nUganda welcomes the international consensus\nreached at Monterrey in March this year, including new\ndevelopment assistance commitments for financing the\ndevelopment of developing countries. We appeal to our\ndevelopment partners and to international financial\ninstitutions to provide additional resources and to\nhonour the agreed targets for official development\nassistance. The priority accorded to the eradication of\npoverty by the Millennium Summit and, in particular,\nthe goal of reducing poverty by half by 2015 will not\nbe realized unless all countries \u2014 especially developed\ncountries \u2014 honour the obligations and commitments that\nhave been agreed to by the international community.\nUganda is committed to fulfilling the objectives\nand goals of the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment (NEPAD). In that connection, we\nwelcome the Group of Eight (G-8) Africa Action Plan,\nadopted by the heads of State or Government of the\neight major industrialized countries at their Summit at\nKananaskis, Canada. NEPAD recognizes that the\nprimary responsibility for Africa's future and for its\ndevelopment rests with Africans, but Africa needs\n7\n\nsupport from its development partners. It is against that\nbackground that Uganda appreciates the commitment\nmade by the G-8 Governments to mobilize and\nenergize global action, to marshal resources and\nexpertise, and to provide impetus in support of\nNEPAD's objectives. We welcome the adoption of the\nUnited Nations Declaration on the New Partnership for\nAfrica's Development by this session of the General\nAssembly (resolution 57/2) and the overwhelming\nsupport that NEPAD has received from the\ninternational community.\nUganda believes that trade \u2014 especially free and\nfair trade \u2014 is the engine of growth and development.\nIn that regard, we urge the international community to\nmake every effort to ensure that the multilateral trading\nsystem caters for the special needs of the least\ndeveloped countries with practical measures that can\nimprove their terms of trade, enhance their export\ncapacity and sustain their balance of payments.\nThe major agricultural products of the least\ndeveloped countries, such as coffee, cotton, bananas\nand tea, are exported to several markets, notably the\nEuropean Union, the United States of America and\nCanada. Because of that fact, conditions of market\naccess are of critical importance for defining the\ntrading opportunities of the least developed countries.\nWhile Uganda welcomes the African Growth and\nOpportunity Act adopted by the United States and the\nEuropean Union's Everything But Arms initiative, we\nbelieve these positive developments should be\ncomplemented by simplified rules of origin and\ncoordinated programmes of assistance by the donor\ncommunity to increase the capacity of least developed\ncountries to produce and market more. We are\nencouraged by Canada's unilateral decision to lift\ntariffs on African exports to Canada and to abolish\nsubsidies on agricultural products. We urge other\ncountries to emulate this positive example.\nThe collapse of commodity prices has contributed\nto a drastic decline in the terms of trade of the least\ndeveloped countries. This matter deserves urgent\nattention by the international community if the least\ndeveloped countries are to be fully integrated into the\nmultilateral trading system. We call upon the international\ncommunity to implement fully the provisions of the\nDoha Declaration in favour of the least developed\ncountries and, in addition, to provide technical support\nto build their capacity in ongoing negotiations.\nIn the short term, aid can be \u2014 indeed, it has\nbeen \u2014 beneficial for the development of developing\ncountries. In that respect, Uganda would like to appeal\nto the donor countries to make the necessary effort to\nhonour the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross\nnational product for official development assistance.\nWe thank those countries which have already reached\nor even surpassed that target.\nI would like to say that Uganda supports the\nSecretary-General's efforts to reform the United\nNations system to make it more efficient and effective.\nReform of the Security Council is, however, long\noverdue. We appeal to all Member States to expedite\nthe process of reform, including the expansion of the\nCouncil's membership in its permanent and non-\npermanent categories.\nFinally, I would like to reiterate Uganda's full\ncommitment to multilateralism and to the principles\nand purposes of the United Nations. We are ready to\nmake every effort to achieve the lofty goals set by the\ninternational community at the Millennium Summit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like\nat the outset to congratulate you, Sir, on your election\nto preside over the General Assembly at this session.\nWe are confident that with your renowned skills and\ndiplomatic experience you will guide the work of\nAssembly to a very successful conclusion. I assure you\nthat you will be able to count on the full support of the\ndelegation of Cape Verde.\nI would like to acknowledge the strong leadership\nand guidance of you predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo,\nwho presided over the Assembly during a particularly\ndifficult time, when important steps were taken to\nimprove the efficiency of the General Assembly with\nview to reinforcing the role of our Organization in\nresolving the issues confronting the international\ncommunity.\nAllow me also to convey a special word of\nappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the\nwise and capable manner in which he has guided the\nUnited Nations, especially in managing the millennium\nagenda, which has produced particularly important\nresults for the international community, such as the\noutcomes of the Monterrey and Johannesburg summits.\nCape Verde welcomes the admission of the Swiss\nConfederation to the United Nations. We are sure that\nSwitzerland's presence in the United Nations can only\nbe of to benefit the Organization, given that country's\nvaluable and renowned diplomatic experience.\nLikewise, we welcome the forthcoming\nadmission of East Timor to the United Nations. At this\ntime, I am pleased to recall that Cape Verde has always\nstood by the Timorese people in their struggle for self-\ndetermination and independence. That young country\nand its people have paid a very high price in order to\nhave their right to existence be recognized. It is\ntherefore a duty of the community of nations to\nmobilize all the support necessary to enable that young\ndemocracy to affirm itself and to make up for the\ndecades lost to destruction and violence.\nThe tragic events that struck vital and emblematic\ncentres in the United States on 11 September 2001\ndeeply shocked the world. The whole international\ncommunity mobilized itself and expressed its solidarity\nwith the United States of America, while at the same\ntime adopting measures adjusted to the challenges\nposed by international terrorism. Cape Verde was\namong the countries that reacted promptly to Security\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) and remains firmly\ncommitted to its implementation.\nThe shockwaves of that catastrophe were felt in\nall latitudes and affected many different aspects of the\nrelations between States. These are reflected adversely\nin lack of economic growth; in increased expenditures\nfor defence and security and the consequent impact on\nthe distribution of resources; and in the daily routines\nof citizens of every country in the world through\nrestrictions on the mobility of people. In certain\nregions of the world, there is an increased risk of\nmilitary confrontation that, should it occur, would have\nimmeasurable consequences.\nThus, today, the question of international security\nhas assumed unprecedented importance in the relations\nbetween States, and the United Nations is called upon\nto play a decisive role in its assessment and\n5\n\nmanagement. Diplomatic means should be privileged\nand pursued in the context of the Security Council.\nA safer world is a more just world. It is crucial\nthat the United Nations strengthen its intervention and\ncoordination capacities in international cooperation to\npromote economic and social development as the\nguarantee of a climate of peace and security throughout\nthe world. It is impossible to create a climate of peace\nand security while more than half of the world's\npopulation remains subject to poverty, malnutrition,\ndisease and ignorance. The international community\nhas to strengthen its commitment to ensure that the\nmillennium goals are achieved in time to give meaning\nto the lives of millions of our brothers and sisters,\nespecially those in the least developed countries, who\ntoday look to the future without any hope.\nAt the expense of great efforts, determination and\nhigh social cost, many of those countries have\nimplemented the deep reforms required by their\nbilateral partners and international financial\ninstitutions. Regretfully, in many cases, instead of\nreceiving increased support to consolidate the reforms,\nthese countries are being devastated by their debt\nburden, public development assistance is being\ngradually reduced and they have yet to enjoy access to\nforeign private investments. The populations are,\nhowever, still waiting for the reforms to produce the\npromised results.\nIt was against this backdrop that the Monterrey\nand Johannesburg summits prompted great\nexpectations, but the results turned out to be relatively\nmodest. Even so, if the consensuses reached at those\nsummits are effectively implemented, they may\nconstitute an important starting point for developing\ncountries. The financial commitments announced in\nMonterrey and the goals set in Johannesburg in the\nvital sectors of water and sanitation are a contribution\nof particular importance to the implementation of the\nmillennium goals. The most important thing now is that\nthe decisions adopted actually be implemented and\nefforts redoubled in order to reach new consensus in\nthe other sectors essential to the planet's sustainable\ndevelopment.\nCape Verde recognizes the efforts that have been\nmade by the United Nations to foster the development\nof the least developed countries and small island\nStates. In this regard, we welcome the creation of the\nOffice of the High Representative for the Least\nDeveloped Countries, Landlocked Developing\nCountries and Small Island Developing States, in\naccordance with the decisions of the Third United\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries.\nCape Verde has achieved positive results in its\nstruggle for economic and social development. The\npeople of my country have demonstrated an enhanced\npolitical maturity that ensures stability and peace and\nthe normal functioning of democratic institutions.\nPower changes have taken place at both the local and\nthe national levels. The most recent United Nations\nHuman Development Report ranked Cape Verde in a\nprivileged position on the African continent.\nHowever, in spite of significant advances made in\nthe past 20 years at the political, social and economic\nlevels, Cape Verde suffers from a structural imbalance\nbetween national production and domestic expenditures\nthat has resulted in a permanent deficit in the balance\nof current transactions, as well as other economic\nimbalances. Unemployment is high and poverty affects\na significant portion of the population.\nThe country's development has been marked by\nadvances and setbacks prompted by its natural\neconomic vulnerability as a small island with a lack of\nnatural resources, a weak production base and a strong\ndependence on external financial flows. These\nconditions are aggravated by the country's location in\nthe Sahel region, which subjects it to prolonged\ndroughts that weaken the environment.\nIn light of all this, and given the low rainfall\nregistered to date, we are facing the prospect of another\ndifficult year. This has prompted the Government to\nadopt emergency measures to alleviate the effects of\ndrought on the most vulnerable. To that end, we have\ncalled for the solidarity of all Capeverdeans while, at\nthe same time, we hope to be able to rely on the active\nsupport of the international community.\nPoverty is another of Cape Verde's limitations\nand poverty reduction is one of the major challenges\nfacing Capeverdean society. At this time, we are\nworking in collaboration with our bilateral partners and\nUnited Nations agencies on medium- and long-term\nstrategies to combat poverty.\nIn the coming years, the country will have to find\nrapid and durable solutions in order to maintain the\nfundamental macroeconomic balances, further and\nconsolidate structural reforms, expand the production\n6\n\nbase and create competitive advantages for the\neconomy at both the external and the internal levels \nin short, solutions leading to economic growth and a\nreduction of the unemployment rate. In that context,\nour efforts are more than ever in need of the proper\npartnerships and foreign private investment so that we\nmay pursue the country's development process begun\nwith national independence in 1975.\nWe are pleased to note that some encouraging\nsigns have begun to appear on our continent. There is a\nfresh wind blowing in Africa. This year, we saw the\nbirth of a new continental organization, the African\nUnion, as well as a new and original partnership, the\nNew Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD).\nWith these were also born renewed hopes for a more\npromising future for the African people. The globally\nfavourable reception to these two African initiatives is\na good omen for the continent. Africa thus seems to be\non its way towards finding its own path by\nstrengthening its endogenous capacities to resolve the\nproblems inherited from colonization and conflicts\noften prompted by external interests. Africa seems to\nbe on the way to finding its own path by strengthening\nits endogenous capacity to resolve the problems\ninherited from colonization and to settle conflicts often\nprompted by external interests.\nIn fact, the African Union and NEPAD are based\non a new foundation, as well as a new environment in\nour continent that is opening new prospects for peace\nand development. We note with satisfaction the\nsubstantial progress made in Angola, Sierra Leone and\nthe Great Lakes region, which points to the definitive\nresolution of conflicts that a year ago did not seem to\nhave a solution. In that context, we should recognize\nthe important role of the efforts of the United Nations\nand the Organization for African Unity in seeking\nsolutions to those conflicts, as well as the decisive\naction that some countries have taken to promote\nunderstanding between belligerent parties.\nWe congratulate the Angolan Government and\nUNITA on finally having found the solution to a\nconflict that for many years devastated that country.\nThe political conditions are now in place to carry out\nthe enormous task of national reconstruction. However,\nthe gravity of the humanitarian situation demands\nsubstantial support from the international community\nto help the Angolans find a rapid and suitable solution\nthat will prevent their problems from growing.\nThe positive signs that could predict a new era for\nAfrica should not cause us to lose sight of the scope\nand the complexity of the challenges we face, which\nresult from historical circumstances, environmental\ndisasters and an accumulation of human errors. The\nmost recent report of the United Nations Conference on\nTrade and Development on least developed countries\npoints out that sub-Saharan Africa is poorer today than\nit was 20 years ago. At the same time, the evaluation of\neconomic progress made in the past decade within the\nframework of the United Nations New Agenda for the\nDevelopment of Africa in the 1990s is disappointing.\nOn the other hand, the spread of pandemics, in\nspite of certain limited success in the fight against\nthem, and the serious food shortages that have affected\nsouthern Africa reveal the seriousness and persistence\nof the problems that Africans must solve.\nThe fact that United Nations cooperation with\nAfrica is being strengthened is noteworthy. That is\nattested to by the increased attention being devoted to\nthe continent's problems. Examples are recent Security\nCouncil meetings that have focused on the situation in\nthe continent, the creation of an Ad Hoc Advisory\nGroup of the Economic and Social Council on\ncountries emerging from conflict and yesterday's\nGeneral Assembly meeting devoted to NEPAD. In that\ncontext, we would also note some of the decisions\nstemming from the Monterrey and Johannesburg\nsummits.\nIt is our hope that this session of the General\nAssembly will make an important contribution to\nfacing the challenges and will enable the United\nNations to strengthen its role as a promoter of peace,\nunderstanding and cooperation among all people of the\nworld.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI\nwould like to begin by extending our sincere\ncongratulations to you, Sir, both personally and as a\nrepresentative of the Czech Republic, on your election\nas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nseventh session. I am confident that, at this important\njuncture of developing collective global action, you\nwill steer the work of this session with your recognized\nability and wisdom, stemming from your country's\nlong experience in confronting aggression and the\nhorrors it brings.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to pay\ntribute to your predecessor, our friend Han Seung-soo,\nand to his country, the Republic of Korea, whose\npositive and effective role led to results that we aspire\nto consolidate.\nI cannot fail to express our deep appreciation to\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, who for the past six\nyears has contributed his experience, wisdom and\nperseverance to reasserting the standing of the\nOrganization and the effectiveness of its role, and to\nstrengthening the principles upon which the Charter\nwas founded. He did all of that despite the inherent\nobstacles that were placed before him, either\ndeliberately or unwittingly, by those ignorant of the\nkey role of the United Nations in providing victors and\nvanquished alike an opportunity to benefit from the\ndevelopments of the age and to achieve the hopes and\naspiration of their peoples to a world that is safer and\nmore just for all. I wish to pay further tribute to the\nSecretary-General for the very courageous statement he\nmade yesterday before the Assembly, a statement in\nwhich he set out his very clear vision in addressing and\nresolving the world's problems.\nOn behalf of Egypt, I would also like to welcome\nSwitzerland as the most recent member of the United\nNations family. We look forward to its active\nparticipation in the work of the Organization, along\nwith that of Timor-Leste, which will soon accede to\nmembership.\nThe current session has been convened one year\nafter the horrific tragedy that befell the United Sates on\n11 September 2001. We reiterate our condolences to\nthe United States. We also emphasize the sense of loss\nwe share with the families of the victims, and we wish\nthe injured a speedy recovery. We hope that this strong\nnation will overcome its ordeal and look towards a\nfuture of cooperation with the rest of the world, a\nfuture forged by all of us for the benefit of all the\ninhabitants of the planet, regardless of their race or\nreligion, without discrimination, intolerance or bias.\nEgypt has stood by the United States throughout this\ndifficult ordeal, whose target was not only a friendly\ncountry but also the values and principles to which we\nall adhere and which relate to respect for humankind\nand its right to life and to choosing to build rather than\nto destroy as the basis for joint action. In that regard, I\nwould like to briefly make the following points.\nFirst, notwithstanding the gravity of the tragic\nevents that took place on that sad day, the world neither\nbegan nor ended on 11 September. Many peoples have\nknown terrorism before. They have suffered from it\nand have resisted it  sometimes alone  in the face\nof hardship and even unjustified criticism. What is new\nis that the heinous crime of 11 September has\ngenerated an unprecedented wave of constructive\ninternational solidarity. It has confirmed what we have\nbeen stating all along: that terrorism is a global\nphenomenon and that it is not associated with any\nparticular country, continent, race or religion. It is an\nexpression of a propensity for evil that remains\ndormant until the opportunity presents itself, either\nfrom within or due to prevailing circumstances, for it\nto awaken and wreak havoc. Thus, it is important to\nrepeat the call that President Mubarak has been making\nfor a number of years; for the convening of an\ninternational conference in which participating nations\nwould shoulder their responsibility to confront\nterrorism. That would lend authority to the\noverwhelming wave of solidarity extended to the\nUnited States in its hour of grief and agony.\nSecondly, the fight against terrorism should not\nbe the lens through which the world views every issue\nand every problem. Terrorism is one of the evil\nphenomena of the world, but it should not cause us to\nforget the evils of poverty, disease, occupation, the\ndenial of individual and national rights or the\nhumiliation of human beings and the destruction of\ntheir livelihood by means of bombs or any other\n6\n\nsimilarly harmful means. Terrorism has roots and\ncauses, but not justifications. I believe that, in most\ncases, a viable remedy for terrorism can be found only\nif we drain the tributaries of hopelessness, anger and\nfrustration that feed the river of evil; otherwise their\nconfluence can become explosive.\nThirdly, it is both necessary and fair that we not\nconfuse those who are unjust with those who are\nunjustly treated. The international community should\nnot confuse terrorism  which we reject, condemn and\nfight  with the legitimate right of self-defence in\nconformity with norms compatible with our values: the\nright to defend oneself against aggression, occupation,\nthe usurpation of rights or attempts to erase cultural\nidentity. That right was exercised by the resistance that\nliberated the United States more than two centuries ago\nand by that which liberated Europe from the Nazi\ntyranny that initiated the Holocaust but ended by\nperishing in its fire. Humanity and right were thus\nvictorious.\nI would like here to reiterate what everybody\nknows: no religion  Islam, Christianity, Judaism or\nBuddhism  preaches terrorism. Those are all\nreligions that proclaim lofty values and ideals. It is\ninappropriate to blame them for the sins of a few of\ntheir followers who have gone astray. Our fight against\nterrorism should proceed from our collective solidarity\nin cherishing life, and not from hatred, which is neither\na solution nor a refuge.\nThe world is at an extremely delicate juncture in\nits history. We are at a crossroads in international\nrelations. The enhancement of the Organization's\ncapacity to respond to the hopes and aspirations that\narose after the end of the cold war and its divisions\ncoincided with a trend towards neglecting that very\ncapacity, a deepening of new divisions and a resort to\nunilateral decisions. Such a trend can lead only to\ndeadlock and prevent us from addressing issues that\nmay determine the fate of humanity and its ability to\nreconcile itself with nature and with advanced\ntechnology and to take the opportunities that they\nprovide for the achievement of a better life free from\npoverty, want, disease, oppression and fear  a life in\nwhich justice and solidarity prevail.\nWe must therefore break this deadlock, which is\nof benefit to no party or cause, by renewing our\ncommitment to the Charter and reaffirming our\ndetermination to work together to strengthen the United\nNations, enhance its effectiveness, promote its\nprinciples and champion its purposes in confronting\nboth the old and the new dangers that face our world.\nOne of these dangers is the persistence of hotbeds of\nconflict and violence in the world, including the\nconflict from which we in the Middle East are\nsuffering.\nI would like to read out the statement made\nyesterday by the President of Egypt, Mr. Hosni\nMubarak. He said:\nI listened attentively to the statement made\nby President Bush to the General Assembly, and I\nwould like to welcome the positive elements in\nthat statement. First, I welcome the affirmation\nby the President of the United States that the\nUnited States is committed to the establishment\nof an independent Palestinian State, side by side\nwith Israel, and that all the parties must assume\ntheir responsibilities in order to achieve that goal.\nWe hope that the peace process will receive a\nstrong impetus through effective participation by\nthe United States, leading to a return of stability\nto the area and to a just and comprehensive peace\nas early as possible.\nSecondly, with regard to Iraq, I welcome\nthe fact that the United States has opened the\ndoor to the pivotal role that must be played by the\nUnited Nations, in particular the Security\nCouncil, on the question of Iraq. Such a course of\naction will break the deadlock and prevent any\nnegative effects resulting from the escalation of\nthe situation, thus maintaining the sovereignty\nand territorial integrity of Iraq.\nIn view of this, I am calling on the Iraqi\nleadership to make use of this opportunity to\nimplement all the relevant Security Council\nresolutions and accept the return of the inspectors\nimmediately so that we can prevent an escalation\nof the situation and the dangerous consequences\nthat would have a very negative impact on the\nsecurity and safety of the brotherly Iraqi people\nand of the Middle East as a whole.'\nThe Palestinian people continue to suffer under\nan oppressive occupation that rejects the judgement of\nhistory, embodied by the Charter, that the age of\ncolonialism has long gone. It is an occupation that\nclings to policies reminiscent of those of the era of\ndarkness and chaos and may even bring us back to that\n7\n\nera. The Arabs have extended their hand to Israel with\na unanimously adopted initiative that reflects their\ngenuine belief in a peace that guarantees  without\nexceptions or double standards  the rights of all. If\nIsrael genuinely desires peace, it must abandon its\ngreed and illusions, put a stop to its practices and\naggressive acts against the Palestinian people and their\nlegitimate leadership and agree to withdraw from all\nArab territories occupied in 1967 in Palestine, Syria\nand Lebanon. An independent Palestinian State, with\nEast Jerusalem as its capital, can then be established\nand can join all the Arab States that have demonstrated\ntheir readiness to establish normal relations with Israel\nand live with it in peace and security.\nJustice, right, mutual respect and the restoration\nto people of their rights were the building blocks on\nwhich peace between Egypt and Israel was established,\nsecuring safe borders and normal relations during the\npast 25 years. The other model, however, which Israel\nhas espoused with respect to our brethren in Palestine,\nhas achieved neither peace nor security; rather, it has\nresulted in victims on both sides, who fall each day,\npaying the price for an attempt to obstruct the natural\ncourse of events.\nThe international community must assume its\nresponsibility in this regard  without prejudice,\nstriving only for what is right; unswerving, moving\nonly towards justice; and without ambition, except for\na peace that will allow the peoples of the region to\nforge a better future. It must reaffirm the necessity of\nabiding by the Charter, United Nations resolutions and\nthe agreements that have been signed, and must reject\nany attempt to abandon them.\nThe debate on security and stability in the Middle\nEast relates also to the situation in Iraq  a situation\nthat must be dealt with in accordance with the\nprovisions of the Charter and relevant resolutions,\nwhich all parties must respect, steering away from a\ncourse of military action. Egypt reaffirms its rejection\nof military strikes against Iraq, whose unity and\nterritorial integrity must be respected and which, for its\npart, must respect the legitimate international will.\nWe must do everything in our power to put an end\nto the extreme suffering of the people of Iraq. We must\nend the embargo, which has inflicted great harm upon\nIraq, negatively affecting and the livelihood of its\ncitizens and damaging future generations.\nAny discussion of the United Nations, its\nachievements and its future would be incomplete\nwithout recalling the tangible contributions of the\nOrganization to focusing attention on the major issues\nof our times and forging an international consensus on\nsome of them. This contribution has been realized\nthrough a series of conferences convened during the\nlast decade of the twentieth century and the first years\nof this century on the environment, human rights,\npopulation, social development, women, financing for\ndevelopment and sustainable development. It has been\nachieved also through the recommendations of the\nMillennium Summit of the General Assembly, which\nattempted to shape a conceptual framework for the\nOrganization's work, based on peace and security for\nnations and individuals, economic and social\ndevelopment in its comprehensive sense, equality\namong States and respect for the cultural diversity of\nnations and societies.\nIn this regard, I would like to reaffirm the\nimportance of the faithful implementation, in both\nletter and spirit, of the outcomes of those conferences.\nIt is also important that no attempt is made to evade or\ncircumvent those mutual obligations. Ultimately, the\njudgement of history will be based not on the\nintentions or objectives contained in political\ndeclarations and final documents, but rather on the\nextent of our success in implementing them. their\nimplementation.\nAny just consideration of the international\neconomic situation must conclude that it is\nunacceptable to continue the present disparities in the\ndistribution of wealth among the peoples of the Earth,\nthe lack of democracy in international economic\ndecision-making and the persistence of arbitrary trade\npractices and monetary policies against the interests of\ndeveloping countries, which have often led to\nsuccessive financial crises and resulted in the economic\ncollapse of many developing countries and the\ndestruction, in a matter of days, of the development\ngains made over decades of arduous national effort.\nOur African continent and its issues occupy a\nspecial place in the international community's efforts\naimed at achieving economic and social development\nand maintaining international peace and security in\naccordance with the collective responsibilities we all\nassume under the Charter. These efforts proceed from a\nfirm conviction that the United Nations, the Security\nCouncil in particular, has primary responsibility for the\n8\n\nmaintenance of peace and security in that continent.\nThey also proceed from our conviction that we, as\nAfrican States, are indispensable partners that bear a\nspecial responsibility to resolve the conflicts that\nfragment our continent and to formulate the\nprogrammes that would extricate our peoples from the\nanguish of poverty to join the course of progress and\nprosperity.\nOur continent has demonstrated its seriousness by\nlaunching the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment (NEPAD), which was endorsed by\nAfrican heads of State at the Lusaka Summit of the\nOrganization of African Unity in 2001, and the African\nUnion, which was inaugurated at the Summit held in\nDurban in July 2002. If by embracing these two\ninitiatives African States have adopted an approach to\nbuilding their future on the basis of the highest ideals\nreflecting the noblest human thinking, then the\ninternational community for its part should support that\napproach in order to provide a better life for Africa's\npeoples, open markets for its products, inject foreign\ninvestment into its economies and assist it to solve its\nproblems.\nThe persistence of volatile conflicts and the\ndanger of the possession by States, organizations or\nindividuals of weapons of mass destruction make it\nincumbent upon us to be more diligent on disarmament\nissues. At the regional level, Egypt has repeatedly\ncalled for serious engagement to rid the Middle East of\nall weapons of mass destruction, first and foremost\nnuclear weapons, and to place all nuclear facilities in\nthe region, without exception, under international\nsupervision.\nPeace and security cannot be established in the\nMiddle East while a grave disparity persists in the\nrights and obligations of the States of the region, which\nupsets its balance of power. Regional stability will be\nachieved only when Israel accedes to the Treaty on the\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), because\nit is the only State in the region that has not yet done\nso. Such stability will also be attained through progress\ntowards the implementation of President Mubarak's\ninitiative to rid the Middle East of all weapons of mass\ndestruction and their delivery systems.\nIn addition, the world confronts other ills that\nrepresent both a challenge and an opportunity for us to\ndemonstrate our ability to work together for the good\nof all. Efforts to combat endemic diseases have fallen\nshort. Countries around the world suffer from the\nspread of HIV/AIDS, which threatens their stability;\nowing to their lack of capacity and resources they are\nunable to contain the pandemic, thus necessitating\nassistance for those countries in dealing with the crisis.\nThe world also confronts numerous\nenvironmental challenges such as those related to\nbiodiversity, climate change, drought and\ndesertification, all of which require the redoubling of\ninternational efforts to address them in order to\nsafeguard the right of future generations to a secure\nlife. Scarcity of water threatens the eruption of\nconflicts in several regions of the world. The\ninternational community must therefore maximize the\nbenefit from, and the proper management of, available\nwater resources while respecting and protecting the\nacquired rights of States and the international\nagreements that govern the rights to utilize those\nresources.\nThe sheer size, complexity and scope of all these\nproblems may lead some to yield to pessimism and\nfrustration, but we are confident that the forces of good\nin the world, armed with the noble principles of the\nCharter  to which we come here every year to\nreiterate our commitment  will remain resolute in\ntheir determination to fashion a better tomorrow. We\nare confident that humankind will overcome the\npropensity for evil so that together we can forge ahead\ntowards frontiers made possible by unprecedented\ntechnological progress at the outset of the twenty-first\ncentury, progress which God has commanded us to\ndedicate to our collective well-being so that the world\ncan live in peace, security, prosperity and harmony.\nThis will allow the young to flourish, potential to\nemerge, hope to overcome fear and pain, light to\nprevail over darkness and humankind to triumph over\nall that hinders its happiness, freedom and\nadvancement."

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President, may I\nbegin by congratulating you on your assumption of the\npresidency and assure you of New Zealand's\ncooperation during your term of office.\n13\n\nThe opening of this, the fifty-seventh session of\nthe General Assembly, came just one day after the\nanniversary of the terrorist attack of 11 September\n2001, which shocked this city and the international\ncommunity. The premeditated and callous mass murder\nof 3,000 people from 79 different countries was a sharp\nwarning to us of the ongoing threats to peace and\nstability in our world. It was to protect humanity\nagainst such threats that the nations of the world came\ntogether in 1945 to establish this Organization in the\nbelief that collective action was necessary to guarantee\nglobal peace.\nToday, in the second year of a new millennium,\nthe need to act multilaterally is greater than ever\nbefore. Terrorism, weapons of mass destruction,\nenvironmental degradation, people-smuggling, drug-\ntrafficking, diseases such as HIV/AIDS and the\nunsustainable depletion of our natural resources are all\nglobal matters that require a collective response.\nWe can be proud that a year ago the response by\nthe United Nations to a new and unprecedented level of\nterrorism was immediate, united and effective. The\nprimary victim of the attack, the United States, sought\nand secured international cooperation that achieved the\nincapacitation of the Al Qaeda terrorist organization\nand the removal of the Taliban regime that had hosted\nit. It was a model for international unity of purpose and\nmultilateral action. It was a lesson that should not be\nforgotten as this Organization tackles other problems\nconfronting humanity.\nNew Zealand has worked wholeheartedly under\nthe mandate provided by the United Nations to defeat\nterrorism. We have introduced legislation to deny\nterrorist organizations funding and resources in line\nwith Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). We have\nsought to assist our neighbours in the Pacific to do the\nsame. We have committed peacekeeping personnel to\nthe International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and\ncombat forces under Operation Enduring Freedom in\nAfghanistan. But we are also aware that actions to\nsuppress terrorism must be accompanied by measures\nto tackle the causes of terrorism. Injustice, lack of\nopportunity, hopelessness, desperation and the failure\nof legitimate channels to redress grievances all give\nrise to resort to terrorist actions.\nThe failure to resolve differences between Israeli\nand Palestinian people in the Middle East continues to\nbe a catalyst for recruitment into terrorism. The\nSecretary-General, in opening this session, spelled out\nthe basis for resolving the dispute. He referred to land\nfor peace, an end to terror and to occupation, and to\ntwo States, Israel and Palestine, with secure and\nrecognized borders. Both peoples are destined to live\nside by side. Both will benefit from an end to violence\nand a negotiated settlement. But agreement requires\ngood faith from each side and a determined effort by\nthe international community. We fully endorse the\nSecretary-General's renewed call for an international\npeace conference. Progress on this issue is now more\nvital than ever.\nThe situation in Iraq is also a threat to world\npeace, but we must look for solutions that will resolve\nand do not exacerbate that threat. No nation can be\nexempt from the requirement to comply with the\nresolutions passed by this Organization. That is\nnecessary if the rule of law is to apply internationally.\nNo nation can be allowed to commit aggression or to\nuse weapons of mass destruction against its own\npeople. The requirement to comply with United\nNations resolutions is not the instruction of one\ncountry to Iraq; it is collective instruction that should\nhave the unanimous endorsement of all Member\ncountries.\nIraq's non-compliance with Security Council\nresolutions is a challenge to the entire United Nations\nmembership. The United Nations must meet this\nchallenge. How the situation is resolved matters to us\nall, not least the countries of the region itself.\nThose who can exercise influence over Iraq\nshould do so to avoid the need for resort to other\nactions. The response chosen by the Security Council\nmust, however, take into account the need not to\nimpose further costs on ordinary Iraqi people innocent\nof any wrongdoing. The response should not involve\nactions that undermine, rather than strengthen, the war\nagainst terrorism.\nThe United Nations has shown that collective\naction can save lives and help rebuild nations. We will\nsoon welcome the world's newest nation, East Timor,\ninto the United Nations, and we should celebrate the\nsuccess of the United Nations peacekeeping mission\nand Transitional Administration in that country. I\ncongratulate Sergio Vieira de Mello, the Secretary-\nGeneral's former Special Representative, on his role,\nand I thank those countries that contributed so much to\n14\n\ngiving hope and opportunity to the people of that small\ncountry.\nNew Zealand has had a battalion of peacekeepers\ndeployed in East Timor since September 1999, and also\nhas peacekeepers serving in 12 other countries. We are\nproud that they have performed their role with\nprofessionalism and respect for the people in whose\ncountries they operate. Notwithstanding the small size\nof our population, New Zealand currently is the\ntwenty-second-largest contributor to the United\nNations peacekeeping personnel.\nThe promotion of human rights is another area\nwhere multilateral action by the international\ncommunity is essential. In the Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights and in the International Covenant on\nCivil and Political Rights, the United Nations has set\nout universal standards for the observance of human\nrights. There is no justification for any country to\ndeviate from those human rights standards. It is a mark\nof shame that States Members of this Organization\ncontinue to breach basic human rights and a disgrace\nthat other countries too often act as apologists for the\noffending regimes.\nAn important landmark in the last year has been\nthe entry into force of the Rome Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court. As the culmination of\nlongstanding efforts by non-governmental\norganizations, Governments and the international\ncommunity as a whole, it offers the prospect of\nbringing justice to the victims of the most horrific\ncrimes known to humankind and bringing their\nperpetrators to justice. It will serve as a deterrent where\nnone has existed before. We have listened carefully to\nthose who argue that the Court is not necessary and\nthat it unduly jeopardizes their peacekeepers, but we\ncannot agree. The status quo, relying on domestic\njurisdiction alone, has failed humankind throughout\nhistory and has borne witness to appalling crimes. The\nnew regime has carefully built-in safeguards to protect\nthe innocent.\nWe were dismayed by the actions of the Security\nCouncil in July. At that time, we challenged both the\nlegitimacy and the substance of the Council's action.\nWe do not believe that it was consistent with the Rome\nStatute or that the Council is able to arrogate to itself\nthe power to change treaty relationships.\nA further issue on which greater progress must be\nmade is that of disarmament. The fact that humanity\nsurvived the nightmare of potential nuclear destruction\nduring the cold war cannot be allowed to make us\ncomplacent about ongoing threats from weapons of\nmass destruction.\nWe welcome the Treaty of Moscow and the\nagreement between Russia and the United States to cut\nthe number of strategic nuclear weapons each country\ndeploys. These reductions, however, are not a\nsubstitute for irreversible cuts in, and the total\nelimination of, those weapons.\nIn some respects even greater danger is posed by\nshort-range tactical nuclear weapons. There is a real\nrisk that these could be launched by accident or in\nconfusion, with no time available for communication\nbetween opposing sides.\nOver the last year, two significant events have\nmade our world a most dangerous place. The first is the\nemergence of international terrorist groups that have\nshown their willingness to use weapons of mass\ndestruction \u2014 biological, chemical or nuclear \u2014\nshould they gain access to them.\nThe second is the situation in South Asia, where\nthe world recently came close to direct conflict\nbetween two countries with nuclear capability. The\ninternational community has not done enough to reduce\nthose risks.\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has\nnot been brought into effect. Progress towards the\nimplementation of undertakings made by nuclear-\nweapon States at the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review\nConference has stalled. Nations have not taken\nsufficient steps to stop the production of fissile\nmaterial and to reduce stocks.\nIn this and in many other areas much more needs\nto be done to address growing problems that affect all\nof us. The awful toll of HIV/AIDS, slowness in\nresponse to global warming and the growth in the\nsmuggling and trafficking of people are but three\nfurther examples.\nIt is essential that we renew our commitment to\nmultilateralism as the best way to address global\nproblems. That requires not simply money but, must\nimportantly, political will. It is not a case of putting\nglobal interests ahead of national interests. Global\n15\n\ninterests are national interests. The United Nations is\nour most valuable international organization, but we\nneed to do more to enhance its relevance, value and its\nunique authority. All of us are stakeholders in its\nsuccess.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt\ngives me pleasure to begin by congratulating\nMr. Kavan on his election as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-seventh session. I wish him every\nsuccess as he embarks on this task. I would also like to\nthank his predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, who so ably\nsteered the work of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nsixth session, which was convened amidst acute and\ngrave circumstances.\nI would be remiss if I failed to express my\nappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his\ntireless work to enhance the role of our international\nOrganization.\nIt is also my pleasure to congratulate the Swiss\nFederation on its admission to membership of our\ninternational Organization.\nLebanon considers the United Nations to be the\nmain body entrusted with the realization of\ninternational peace and security and with upholding\nrespect for the rules of international law. The United\nNations is a safe haven for States, particularly small\nones, which find in its Charter the reassurances they\nneed in a turbulent world. Therefore, any departure\nfrom the Charter, circumventing, disregarding, or\noverstepping its authority; any selective handling of its\nresolutions; or any attempt to impose settlements on\nand solutions to conflicts and disputes outside its\nframework flagrantly undermines the credibility of the\nOrganization and its organs, particularly the Security\nCouncil. Such acts are a devastating blow to the pillars\nof international order.\nLebanon believes that there is a causal\nrelationship between security and sustainable\n27\n\ndevelopment and calls for a renewed effort, under\nUnited Nations auspices, to eliminate poverty and\ndisease, bridge the gap between the North and the\nSouth, and reduce social disparities. These are the\nscourges that are often manipulated by those who\nharbour ill intentions towards humanity. In this context,\nLebanon welcomes the establishment of the African\nUnion and supports the principles on which the New\nPartnership for Africa's Development was built.\nThe work of this session coincides with the first\nanniversary of the horrific terrorist attacks and the\nterrible tragedy that struck the United States of\nAmerica. The world is still suffering from their terrible\nrepercussions. On behalf of Lebanon, I avail myself of\nthis opportunity to reiterate our sympathy with the\nbereaved families. Like us, they are heartbroken over\nthe loss of their sons, relatives and loved ones. We also\nrenew our commitment to cooperating with the\ninternational community to combat international\nterrorism in accordance with the provisions of Security\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) of 28 September 2001\nand other relevant United Nations resolutions.\nThe events of 11 September 2001 impeded the\nconvening of the ninth summit of the Francophonie,\nscheduled to be held last year under the theme of\n\u201cDialogue among civilizations\u201d. My country is proud\nto be hosting the conference in mid-October. There is\nno doubt that the choice of theme for the conference\nbefore these dramatic events arose from the foresight\nof its members and participants and from their\nconviction of the need to interact and to engage in\ndialogue, far removed from the logic of confrontation\nand hostility.\nLebanon itself was the target of terrorist acts\nprior to 11 September 2001 and its army stood up to\nthe perpetrators and overcame them. Lebanon and its\nArab brothers have been suffering from the State\nterrorism continuously practised by Israel without\ninternational deterrence since the Deir Yassin massacre\nand the massacres in the Qana and Jenin camps.\nIsrael has recently begun to manipulate the tragic\nevents of September 2001 and the international\ncampaign to combat terrorism, using them shamelessly\nas a pretext for persecuting the Palestinian people and\ndepriving them of their right to self-determination.\nIsrael has launched a slanderous campaign of threats\nagainst Lebanon and its legitimate resistance, as well\nas against Syria, while the origin of the conflict in the\nregion is the Israeli occupation of Arab territories.\nThe reality is that Israel has continuously defied\nresolutions of international legitimacy. Israel has\ndisregarded Security Council resolution 425 (1978) for\nmore than 22 years and has refused to implement the\nSecurity Council resolution calling for the\nestablishment of a fact-finding mission to investigate\nthe Jenin camp massacre. It has resorted to terror and\nviolence to implement expansionist and settlement\npolicies. It has accumulated weapons of mass\ndestruction in an arsenal primarily stacked with\nnuclear, biological and chemical weapons. It continues\nto oppose all attempts to reach a just and\ncomprehensive peaceful solution to the Middle East\nissue, and remains, nonetheless, in total impunity,\nnever held accountable or punished for its actions. That\nsituation can only strengthen the impression among\nArab Governments and peoples that there is a double\nstandard at play in international affairs, and that,\nregrettably, Israel is allowed to remain outside and\nabove the law.\nShimon Peres today accused Hezbollah of\nterrorism because it has effectively contributed to the\nlegitimate resistance against Israeli occupation and to\nforcing Israeli forces to withdraw from most occupied\nLebanese territory.\nHezbollah is represented in Lebanese parliament\nand participates in the political, economic and social\nlife of Lebanon.\nMr. Peres is in fact the last person who should\nhave the right to talk about terrorism. He is the one\nresponsible directly for the killing of 102 women,\nchildren and elderly at Qana when Israel bombed the\nUNIFIL tent where they had sought safety and shelter.\nIsrael should be held accountable for such crimes.\nIsrael was founded on terrorism and has used it to\noccupy land and establish faits accomplis.\nIf Israel's perpetration of the massacres of Dair\nYasin, Qana and Jenin is not terrorism, then what is\nterrorism?\nIs not Israel's daily breaking of the sound barrier\nover Lebanese cities and villages a form of terrorism\nand intimidation?\n28\n\nIs not Israel's kidnapping of Lebanese citizens\nfrom their homes and detaining them in Israeli prisons\nas hostages another form of terrorism?\nIs not leaving hundreds of thousands of\nlandmines in south Lebanon to kill civilians a form of\nterrorism that should be strongly condemned?\nIs not Israel's constant threat of invading\nLebanon and destroying its civil institutions,\ninfrastructure and development projects a terrible form\nof terrorism, devastating to our hopes in reconstruction\nand rehabilitation?\nAs if occupying Arab lands and terrorizing their\ncivilian populations were not enough, Israeli greed\nprompts Israel to usurp our natural wealth and water\nresources, contravening international laws and\ninstruments. The Israeli Prime Minister directly\nthreatened to attack Lebanon, using the pretext that we\nare diverting the course of the Hasbani and Wazzani\nrivers. However, the fact is that Lebanon is trying to\ndraw limited amounts of water for some poor southern\nvillages that have suffered from the Israeli occupation\nfor many years, which will lead us to pump a total of\napproximately 9 million cubic metres annually. By all\nstandards, that amount is far below our legitimate\nrights, it represents only one tenth of our right.\nLebanon again rejects those Israeli threats and\ndraws the attention of the Assembly and the Security\nCouncil to the danger those threats represent and to\ntheir direct negative impact on international peace and\nsecurity. It is difficult for any human society to strive\nfor security in the absence of political, economic and\nsocial justice. We, therefore, believe that security\napproaches and partial interim solutions alone cannot\npossibly succeed in resolving the Middle East conflict.\nTherefore, we call for the adoption of an approach that\ntakes into account the priority of the political\ndimension of the conflict and the need to arrive at a\njust and comprehensive solution to the conflict in the\nregion in all its aspects.\nIn that context, Arab leaders unanimously\nadopted an integral, indivisible peace initiative at the\nArab Summit, held in Beirut on 28 and 29 March 2002,\nbased on the following conditions.\nFirst, Israel must withdraw completely from the\noccupied Arab territories, including the occupied\nSyrian Golan, to the border of 4 June 1967, and from\nthe territories it still occupies in southern Lebanon;\nsecondly, it must reach a just solution to the problem of\nthe Palestinian refugees, to be agreed upon in\naccordance with General Assembly resolution 194\n(III); thirdly, it must agree to the establishment of an\nindependent and sovereign Palestinian State in the\nPalestinian territories occupied since 4 June 1967 in the\nWest Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as\nits capital.\nSubsequently, the Arab States will consider the\nArab-Israeli conflict ended, will enter into a peace\nagreement with Israel, will ensure security for all the\ncountries of the region and will establish normal\nrelations with Israel in the context of that just peace. A\ncentral element of the Arab peace initiative is securing\nan agreement not to allow any type of resettlement of\nPalestinian refugees that is incompatible with the\nparticularities of the host Arab countries.\nIt is unfortunate that Israel has responded to that\ninitiative by increasing its aggression and reoccupying\nthe West Bank, relentlessly targeting human lives and\nproperty in the occupied Palestinian territory.\nSimultaneously, others have chosen to ignore or\noverride the initiative, despite its comprehensiveness,\nunanimous acceptance by Arabs and broad\ninternational support.\nThe Beirut Summit established a special\ncommittee to implement the Arab peace initiative.\nOnce formed, the committee requested a meeting with\nthe Quartet to present the initiative and confirm its\nstatus as a point of reference for the settlement of the\nArab-Israeli conflict. The initiative contains all\nprevious references dating back to the Madrid Peace\nConference, held in 1991, and is based on resolutions\nof international legitimacy. We seek to submit it to the\nSecurity Council for adoption and for the subsequent\nestablishment of an international mechanism to\nimplement it.\nA meeting was held yesterday between the\nQuartet and a delegation of the committee at United\nNations Headquarters. We hope that this will pave the\nway for a mechanism of prior consultations and joint\neffort based on resolutions of international legitimacy\nand the Arab peace initiative.\nThe Arab peace initiative, which we uphold and\nwhich was adopted unanimously by the Arab countries,\nrepresents a historic opportunity that may not present\nitself again. It cannot be replaced by partial or interim\napproaches, the futility of which has been proven\n29\n\nthroughout decades. Instead of leading to the long-\nawaited peace, they have led to renewed violence. We,\ntherefore, call upon the international community to\nadopt this initiative and to support it, as it represents an\nopportunity for achieving our aspirations \u2014 a just and\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East.\nSubmitting disputes before the United Nations\nand implementing United Nations resolutions,\nparticularly those of the Security Council, can\nguarantee the peaceful settlement of any given conflict.\nBy following that course, the parties could be spared\nthe need to settle their dispute by military means. It\nmay not be easy to contain the tragic ramifications of\nmilitary action in a given region. That is particularly\ntrue of Iraq, which also was the subject of deliberations\nat the Beirut Arab Summit. It was also decided there\nthat the solution to the Iraqi problem must be achieved\nthrough dialogue between Iraq and the United Nations.\nIraq should not once again be a theatre of war, which\nwould increase the suffering of its people. The Arab\nleaders consider an attack against any Arab State a\nthreat to the national security of all Arab countries.\nAs president of the Arab Summit, Lebanon hopes\nthat Iraq's compliance with the will of the international\ncommunity and allowing the return of the international\nweapons inspectors will lead to the end of the suffering\nof its people and to a comprehensive solution that will\nlead to the implementation of Security Council\nresolutions and to the lifting of sanctions. We also hope\nthat that will enable the Middle East to rid itself of\nweapons of mass destruction and will avert the threat\nor use of force against Iraq, thus preserving and\nrespecting its sovereignty, independence and territorial\nintegrity.\nLebanon takes pride in its strong and positive\nrelationship with the United Nations, being one of its\nco-founders and having contributed to the drafting of\nits Charter as well as to the drafting of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights. As members may be\naware, since 1978, the Organization has deployed the\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in\nthe aftermath of the Israeli occupation. In May 2000,\nUNIFIL had the opportunity to begin fulfilling its\nmandate after Israel had been forced to withdraw from\nmost of the territories in the south. That withdrawal\nwas possible thanks to our people's solidarity, their\nlegitimate resistance to the Israeli occupation and the\nfact that our Government embraced their heroic efforts\nfor liberation, and the international support for their\njust cause. The Lebanese Shebaa Farms, at the foot of\nMount Hermon, and other points along the withdrawal\nline remained under occupation.\nAnother important aspect of UNIFIL's mandate\nthat has yet to be fulfilled is the restoration of\ninternational peace and security. That task remains\nhampered by Israel's continued occupation, threats\nagainst Lebanon and provocations, as seen daily in the\nrepeated violation of Lebanon's sovereignty over its\nland, airspace and territorial waters. Israel continues to\noccupy the Syrian Golan and to ignore the right of\nPalestinian refugees to return to their homes. It has\nrejected every initiative to find a just and\ncomprehensive solution to the Middle East problem. I\nshould like to take advantage of this opportunity to\ncommend the efforts of the United Nations and\nUNIFIL's important role as it fulfils its mandate.\nThe liberation of Lebanese territories from Israeli\noccupation will remain incomplete unless we address\nthe heinous legacy of occupation and succeed in\nfinding a just solution to the problem of Palestinian\nrefugees, in particular those who live in Lebanon. Such\na solution should be based on their right to return and\non a rejection of their settlement in Lebanon. Failure to\nfactor the refugees into the equation of a solution based\non the right to return and on the rejection of\nresettlement in host countries would create a time\nbomb. It would undermine the security that we are all\nstriving to attain in the Middle East on the basis of a\npeaceful, comprehensive and just settlement of the\nconflict.\nWe should like to stress here that a solution to the\nquestion of Palestinian refugees cannot be found\nthrough exclusive bilateral Palestinian-Israeli\nnegotiations. Guaranteed respect for the rules of\ninternational law and the permanence of any solution\nrequire that host and other concerned countries,\nincluding Lebanon, be involved in the negotiating\nprocess.\nWith regard to mine clearance, Lebanon is\nstepping up its cooperation with the United Nations to\nassist in clearing the mines that the Israeli occupying\nforces are responsible for laying in our territories. I\nwill note that Israel failed to hand over complete maps\nand records indicating the specific locations of those\nmines.\nWe in Lebanon attach the highest importance to\nthe release of Lebanese citizens who are unduly\n30\n\ndetained in Israeli prisons. They were kidnapped by\nIsrael and incarcerated as hostages, in flagrant defiance\nof the rules and instruments of international law.\nIt is no secret that the Israeli occupation of\nsouthern Lebanon has taxed our endurance. Our\ncitizens' lives have been tragically shattered, their\nproperties have been destroyed, their infrastructures\nhave been decimated and our development has been\nhampered. Increased international assistance is\nrequired to revitalize our economy and to increase our\nopportunities for growth. Lebanon reserves the right to\ndemand compensation for the damage caused by Israeli\noccupation and acts of aggression, in accordance with\nestablished procedures in international political and\njudicial forums.\nThe reconstruction and rehabilitation of the\nliberated Lebanese territories and the revitalization of\nLebanon's economy are among our Government's\nhighest priorities. Lebanon continues to work for the\nrecovery of its economy and for the reform of its\ntaxation system through the adoption of carefully\ndeveloped measures and legislation, including the\nvalue-added tax on goods and services and the gradual\nreduction of tariffs, in addition to the direct tax levy\nand the rationalization of spending. Lebanon's\nparliament recently adopted the Privatization Act,\nwhich regulates that aspect of economic activity and\ndefines its conditions and field of application. Such\nlegislation, including the two recently adopted acts,\njoins a series of laws developed to enhance investors'\nconfidence in the free-market system, which we are\nkeen to preserve.\nAlong the same lines, those in positions of\nresponsibility in the Lebanese Administration are\nsubject to strict accountability and liability rules,\nincluding money-laundering and the prohibition of\nillegitimate gain. It is worth mentioning here that, over\nthe years, the Lebanese internal security forces have\ndestroyed all illegitimate crops, including hashish. But\nLebanon did not receive the assistance, provided to\nothers, that would have enabled our farmers to live in\ndignity.\nLebanon signed a partnership agreement with the\nEuropean Union last June after acceding to the Greater\nArab Free Trade Zone, to which most Arab States\ncurrently belong. Preparations are under way for us to\njoin the World Trade Organization, in which we\ncurrently enjoy observer status.\nWe gather here under the roof of the United\nNations, our common home, to engage in dialogue on\nthe best ways to translate into reality the great values\nof the Charter. Lebanon takes pride in its firm belief in\nthose values and in the fact that, in its national unity, it\nembodies the plurality of its society. It stands for a rich\nhuman experience, both civilized and pioneering, of\nwhich we are proud and which the international\ncommunity is surely keen to preserve.\nLebanon looks forward to cooperating with other\nMembers to contribute to this session's success and to\nfinding constructive solutions to the problems and\nchallenges that we face, while upholding the principles\nof liberty, justice and peace around the world,\nparticularly in the Middle East region. Finding a just\nand comprehensive solution to the Middle East conflict\nin all its aspects will surely liberate our States and\npeoples from the grip of a protracted problem that has\ndepleted their resources and hampered their\ndevelopment.\n\n\n\n\n"

Your election as President of the\nfifty-seventh session of the General Assembly is\nsymbolic not only of the personal respect you hold, but\nalso of the authority your country enjoys in the world\ncommunity. In recent decades, the Czech Republic has\nbeen through some hard times. Because of that, you\nwell understand the problems of Kyrgyzstan, which is\ngoing through a transition from its authoritarian past to\na democratic future.\nI take this opportunity to thank Mr. Han Seung-\nsoo for his excellent work as the President of the\nprevious session. The present session is significant in\nthat the Swiss Confederation and, soon, the Democratic\nRepublic of East Timor will have become Members of\nthe United Nations. We warmly welcome the\nrepresentatives of those countries, who are\nparticipating in this session of the General Assembly.\nThis is my first address from the rostrum of the\nGeneral Assembly as President of the sovereign\nKyrgyz Republic. 11 years have passed since the State\nof Kyrgyzstan declared its independence. What has\nbrought me to the Assembly is my desire to share with\nyou my thoughts on the most pressing problems of our\nnational development.\nFirst, I would like to refer to the International\nYear of Mountains, which is being celebrated this year\npursuant to a resolution adopted at the fifty-third\nsession of the General Assembly of the United Nations.\nIt was proclaimed at the initiative of Kyrgyzstan and\nother mountainous countries, for which the problem of\n7\n\nthe development of mountainous areas is of crucial\nimportance. We are very grateful for the support given\nto that initiative. Thanks to the efforts of the United\nNations, important events have already taken place at\nthe regional and national levels. The outcome of the\nwork done will be discussed at the Global Mountain\nSummit, to be held in our capital, Bishkek, at the end\nof October. We will create the most favourable\nconditions for its work, in the best tradition of Kyrgyz\nwarmth and hospitality.\nI believe the delegates present in the Hall will\nagree that among the many complex challenges facing\nthe world community, the most pressing problems are\ndeveloping democracy and guaranteeing human rights\nand freedoms. Those goals have been made a top\npriority in the Kyrgyz Republic since the earliest days\nof its establishment.\nWe are convinced that in modern day conditions,\nunless there is consistent democratization and human\nemancipation, progress and prosperity cannot be\nachieved. However, the remnants of the authoritarian\nSoviet heritage still has a tenacious hold on the minds\nof our people, especially among the elderly. There is\ngood reason why former Soviet States are referred to in\ninternational classifications as transitional countries.\nOur experience has shown that the process of transition\nis particularly difficult not only in the area of the\neconomy but in the minds of people.\nOn our road towards democracy, we have\nexperienced both joyful success and bitter failure.\nWhen we analysed our failures, we came to understand\nthat their main cause was a lack of democracy. In order\nto give the development of democracy a new and\npowerful impetus, I as President proclaimed a new\nnational idea: Kyrgyzstan, a country of human rights.\nWe intend to elaborate a democratic code and to\nestablish a council for democratic security. Recently, in\norder to further the process of democratization, I took\nthe decision to reform our Constitution and to convene\na Constitutional Assembly. During my stay in the\nUnited States, the Constitutional Assembly is at the\nconcluding stage of its work. The difficulty is that\nsociety has different approaches for developing\ndemocracy. Some forces claiming to be ardent\nsupporters of democracy consider the essence of\ndemocracy to be the destruction of existing structures\nand the undertaking of new experiments. That would\ncause the transition from authoritarianism to\ndemocracy to take a very long time, indeed, while\npeople have long awaited stability. On behalf of the\npeople of Kyrgyzstan, I would like to assure the world\ncommunity that we adhere to the principles of\ndemocracy and will confidently follow that path\ndespite the difficulties and obstacles that we encounter.\nI consider the problem of poverty eradication to\nbe as important as the problem of the development of\ndemocracy. The problem has worsened under present\nconditions in the post-Soviet period. We are not the\nonly poor country in the world. There are many reasons\nfor this, and I do not intend to analyse them in my\nstatement. Poverty has a negative impact on people's\nmorale and creates many obstacles to developing the\ndemocratic process. Moreover, poverty is a breeding\nground for extremism and international terrorism.\nThe world community has repeatedly declared its\nresolve to help countries in need to overcome poverty.\nMr. George Bush, the President of the United States,\npromised to substantially increase assistance to poor\ncountries when he announced the creation of the\nMillennium Challenge Account. We are grateful for\nevery initiative of the United Nations, the United\nNations Development Programme and other\ninternational organizations, as well as of donor\ncountries, for their assistance to poor countries.\nHowever, those efforts are still not sufficient.\nFollowing the example of my colleagues from\nother poor countries, I would like to call upon the\nworld community not to slacken its efforts in the\ncampaign against poverty and to find new resources\nand new approaches in solving this problem. That\nwould help reduce pockets of instability, encourage the\ndevelopment of democracy and have a positive impact\non the world's development as a whole.\nI would like to refer to the problem of\ninternational terrorism, which is the main danger to the\nworld. New York, where the Assembly is now\ngathered, was witness to a terrible tragedy which\nshowed the horrendous, brute face of terrorism. The\nKyrgyz Republic, which in past years experienced\nincursions into its territory by international terrorist\ngroups, has strongly supported the call of the President\nof the United States of America, Mr. George Bush, to\ncreate an anti-terrorism coalition. Together with Russia\nand our other partners and allies, Kyrgyzstan joined the\ncampaign against the horrendous, bestial face of\nterrorism. We very much appreciate the work of the\nCounter-Terrorism Committee of the Security Council,\n8\n\nand I assure you that Kyrgyzstan will extend all\npossible assistance to the Committee in its work.\nAt the global, regional and national levels,\nKyrgyzstan is actively participating in the struggle\nagainst international terrorism. We have put our\nterritory at the disposition of the military forces of the\nanti-terrorism coalition. In December of last year, our\ncapital, Bishkek, hosted an international conference\nunder the auspices of the United Nations and the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to\nstrengthen comprehensive efforts to fight international\nterrorism. A Declaration and Programme of Action\nadopted at that time established a firm foundation for\naction at the global level.\n\nAnti-terrorism centres have been established\nwithin the framework of the Shanghai Organization of\nCooperation and the Commonwealth of Independent\nStates. Within the framework of the Collective Security\nTreaty, Collective Rapid Deployment Forces have been\nestablished with headquarters in Bishkek.\nHowever, there are still many unresolved issues\nconfronting the anti-terrorist coalition in Afghanistan,\nwhere, until recently, the main redoubt of international\nterrorism was located. On 23 September I will be\nmeeting with President George Bush in the White\nHouse. I believe that the question of our cooperation in\nthe struggle against terrorism will be a top priority. I\nintend to assure the President of the United States that\nKyrgyzstan, acting together with Russia and our other\npartners, will discharge its responsibility.\nOne of the most important points of my statement\nto the General Assembly is to draw the Assembly's\nattention to a major event in the Kyrgyz Republic. I am\nreferring to the fact that, next year, in 2003, our people\nwill be celebrating the 2,200th anniversary of Kyrgyz\nStatehood. Taking into account the wishes of wide\nsegments of our society, I, as President, issued an edict\nproclaiming 2003 the year of Kyrgyz Statehood.\nFor the newly independent States that emerged\nfrom the collapse of the Soviet Union, a search for our\nhistoric and ethnic roots has become a vital task. I am\nsure that, at the dawn of their independence, many\nStates that are now represented in the United Nations\nexperienced the same desire. Research carried out by\nour historians and a study of the works of well-known\norientalists have led us to the conclusion the formation\nof the first Kyrgyz State took place at the end of the\nthird century B. C. This has been convincingly borne\nout by ancient Chinese chronicles. The famous Chinese\nchronicler Sima Qian, who is considered to be the\nChinese Herodotus, drew up a chronicle in verse about\nthe existence in far-off times of a Kyrgyz State in the\nform of a Kyrgyz princedom. That State flourished at\ncertain periods and at others merely smouldered. But\nnational Statehood was carried forward by the Kyrgyz\npeople for many centuries up to the end of the\ntwentieth century, when it took the form of the Kyrgyz\nRepublic, which later became a Member of the United\nNations.\nI would like to remind the Assembly that, in\n1995, the Kyrgyz people celebrated a great event,\nnamely, the one thousandth anniversary of our great\nwork of folk literature, the heroic epic Manas. We are\nvery grateful to the United Nations for the decision it\ntook at the time to give that event international\nresonance. The celebration in Kyrgyzstan of the one\nthousandth anniversary of the Manas epic took place\nwith great enthusiasm. That contributed to an\nunprecedented revival of national spirit and to the unity\nof our people.\nFrom this rostrum, I wish to address the\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan and all the delegations\nparticipating in the work of the current session to ask\nthem to adopt a decision to recognize as a great historic\nevent in the life our country the 2,200th anniversary of\nKyrgyz Statehood, and to give it international status.\nThat would be accepted by my people with profound\ngratitude. It would also do much to promote domestic\nstability and further consolidate the multi-ethnic nature\nof my nation. In cooperation with other delegations,\nmy delegation will submit an appropriate draft\nresolution on this subject that I, as President of\nKyrgyzstan, would ask the Assembly to support.\nKyrgyzstan's cooperation with the United Nations\nis multilateral in nature. It encompasses a wide\nspectrum of problems of interest to us all. We have\nreceived unwavering support and assistance from the\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies at every\nstage of our development since the proclamation of\nState independence. I should like to take this\nopportunity to express our sincere gratitude for that\nassistance. I also wish to proclaim from this rostrum\nthat Kyrgyzstan will in the future remain firmly\ncommitted to the purposes and principles of the\n9\n\nOrganization, and that we will do whatever we can to\nmake them a reality.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffTwo years ago I\ncame to the rostrum of this Assembly with mixed\nfeelings. On the one hand, my country had just\nwitnessed an unprovoked attempt to derail the peace\nprocess. The United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone\n(UNAMSIL) was still recovering from a brazen affront\nto its military capability and the authority of the\nSecurity Council. On the other hand, I was optimistic,\nfirst of all because the people of Sierra Leone had once\nagain demonstrated their resolve to maintain their\nstruggle for peace. I was also optimistic because the\nSecurity Council had responded appropriately by\ngiving UNAMSIL additional responsibilities within its\nmandate, and by increasing the troop level of the\nmission.\nToday, I stand here with only one feeling, an\noverwhelming feeling of joy. At long last the rebel war\nin Sierra Leone is over. All combatants have been\ndisarmed and demobilized. Reintegration is well under\nway. Over 55,000 ex-combatants are currently engaged\nin reintegration programme activities, ranging from\nformal education and vocational-skills training to\nsmall-scale trade, agriculture and community\ndevelopment. While the National Commission on\nDisarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration is\nconcentrating on the integration of ex-combatants,\nanother national agency, the National Commission for\nSocial Action, is actively engaged in programmes that\nwill benefit all categories of victims of the brutal war,\nparticularly the most vulnerable population groups.\nMost heartening of the recent positive\ndevelopments was the affirmation four months ago by\nthe people of Sierra Leone that they would never forgo\ntheir constitutional right to choose their leaders freely\nthrough the ballot box. They sent a resounding message\nto the entire world that, in Africa, it is still possible to\nhold free and fair elections.\n4\n\nOur objective was not merely to win the rebel\nwar, but to defend the right of our people to live. We\nfought against a brutal attempt by a few who, with the\nassistance of forces within and outside the subregion,\nwere determined to assume power and gain unimpeded\nand perpetual access to our mineral resources. My\nprimary objective as the democratically elected leader\nwas for us to win the peace. Today, I am pleased to say\nhere that the people of Sierra Leone are continuing to\nwork assiduously to win the peace.\nWe share the view that there cannot be real peace\nin Sierra Leone without justice. The support that we\nhave so far received for the establishment of a special\ncourt to bring to justice those who bear the greatest\nresponsibility for serious breaches of international\nhumanitarian law and the national laws of Sierra Leone\nshould also be regarded as part of the peace dividend.\nWe are also convinced that we cannot speak about\nlasting peace in Sierra Leone without national\nreconciliation. Making the Truth and Reconciliation\nCommission fully operational after its inauguration in\nJuly 2002 has now become one of our major\npreoccupations. Let me add, however, that inadequate\ninternational support for the Commission could\njeopardize prospects for national reconciliation which,\nmembers will agree with me, is one of the prerequisites\nof lasting peace and justice.\nThe victory that the people of Sierra Leone have\nso far achieved in the peace process is theirs, but not\ntheirs alone. It is also a victory for the United Nations,\nthe Economic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS) and the entire international community.\nIndeed, it is a victory for humanity, for all those who\ncherish the dignity and worth of the human person.\nTherefore, let me take this opportunity, on behalf of\nevery Sierra Leonean, to express our profound and\nsincere gratitude to the United Nations family,\nECOWAS and its Monitoring Group, and other regional\nintergovernmental and non-governmental organizations\nfor their support in our prolonged struggle. This was a\npartnership for peace and security that we will never\nforget.\nWith your permission, Sir, I am obliged once\nagain to single out for commendation some special\nfriendly States that played a crucial role in that effort. I\nrefer to the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of\nNigeria, the Republics of Guinea, Ghana and Mali, and\nthe United States of America and China, among others.\nWe will always remember their place in the great\npartnership for peace and security that wrenched Sierra\nLeone from the verge of total destruction. This is what\ncollective responsibility is all about in our\ninterdependent world.\nWhile we celebrate our mutual success, we\nshould at the same time be aware of the challenges that\nwe face not only in Sierra Leone, but also in the Mano\nRiver Union and the West African subregions. Our\nsuccess notwithstanding, the situation in our part of the\ncontinent continues to pose a threat to international\npeace and security. That threat will remain and could\nincrease if we fail to consolidate the gains that we have\nmade in Sierra Leone. I should therefore like to\nreiterate my recent appeal to the United Nations and\nthe international community as a whole to remain\nengaged in our national effort to consolidate our hard-\nwon peace. I was encouraged that, following the May\n2002 elections, the Secretary-General and the President\nof the Security Council underscored the need to further\nconsolidate what we have achieved so far.\nThe people of Sierra Leone and the international\ncommunity have made considerable investment in\nmaterial and human resources to bring us to the stage at\nwhich we find ourselves today. It would be a terrible\nmistake if, by sheer complacency and a failure to adopt\nthe appropriate course of action, we should allow the\ncountry to slip back into armed conflict. We share the\nview of the Secretary-General, expressed in his latest\nreport on UNAMSIL, that the Organization should\nensure that the next phase of the Mission does not\njeopardize the progress achieved so far in stabilizing\npeace in Sierra Leone.\nBeyond Sierra Leone, there are ominous signs of\nspillover conflicts hovering around the subregion. It\nwould also be tragic if we should underestimate the\ncurrent threat to peace and go on procrastinating about\nways of preventing a spillover.\nHow then do we go about ensuring, at least in the\nshort run, that Sierra Leone will sustain its newly-won\npeace? How do we contain the current hostilities across\nthe border with Liberia? The need to address these\nquestions has become more urgent as we approach the\nend of the current mandate of UNAMSIL. While\nlooking forward to the new phase of that important\ninstrument of peace, I thought that I should draw the\nattention of the Security Council, through the\nSecretary-General, to some of the issues that could be\n5\n\ntaken into consideration and linked to an exit strategy\nfor UNAMSIL.\nRecently, I shared my thoughts on this and related\nmatters in a letter which I addressed to the Secretary-\nGeneral. The letter has since been circulated as\nSecurity Council document S/2002/975 of 29 August\n2002. Permit me to highlight some of the issues raised\nin that communication. These are issues related to the\ncapacity of the Sierra Leone Armed Forces and the\nSierra Leone police to perform their respective\nfunctions more effectively throughout the country; the\nchallenges facing us in the integration of all ex-\ncombatants; the risks following from the turbulent\nsituation in neighbouring Liberia, and particularly its\nrepercussions for peace and stability in Sierra Leone\nand the Mano River Union as a whole; the danger of\nthe apparent absence of a strategic plan of the\ninternational community to address the situation in\nLiberia, especially as the country approaches crucial\nelections next year; and finally, the delay in responding\nto the request for international assistance to ECOWAS\nin ensuring security on the borders shared by Guinea,\nLiberia and Sierra Leone.\nWe are pleased that the Secretary-General has\ntaken these and other issues into account in preparing\nhis recommendations to the Security Council for a\nmeasured and phased downsizing of UNAMSIL. This\nwill ensure that we do not provoke any new sense of\ninsecurity in a population that has been traumatized for\ntoo long. I am also confident that the Security Council\nwill consider the recommendations carefully, especially\nin the light of my Government's and the Secretary-\nGeneral's own assessment that the conflict in Liberia\nstill constitutes the most serious threat to the stability\nthat now prevails in Sierra Leone. Who will forget that\nthe 10-year rebel war in Sierra Leone was launched\nfrom the territory of Liberia?\nThe current state of peace and security in Sierra\nLeone and the rest of the Mano River Union subregion\nis obviously a matter of constant concern to us.\nHowever, as a member of the global community, we are\nalso seriously concerned about impediments to\ninternational cooperation for economic and social\ndevelopment; about threats to international peace and\nsecurity, including the nuclear arms race and terrorism\nin all its forms and manifestations; and about the rights\nof such vulnerable population groups as children and\npeople with disabilities. All those often require\nappropriate multilateral agreements or arrangements to\nensure that they are effectively addressed.\nNever since the end of the Second World War has\nmultilateral cooperation become such a necessary\nmeans for resolving international disputes and for\nensuring the well-being of people everywhere. Sierra\nLeone, therefore, attaches the utmost importance to the\nstrengthening of multilateral cooperation, as reflected\nby such recent conferences as the International\nConference on Financing for Development and the\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development. Those\nprovide effective platforms for articulating the interests\nof all States and for devising common strategies to\naddress collectively problems that would otherwise\noverwhelm the capacities of individual countries or\nregions.\nIt is, therefore, self-evident that we must continue\nto pursue the multilateral approach to those and other\ninternational issues. The consequences of diminishing\nor bypassing the multilateral approach in matters that\naffect the lives of millions of people worldwide could,\nI should emphasize, be disastrous for us all.\nTwo years ago, in the Millennium Declaration,\nheads of State and Government, in the spirit of\ninterdependence, made a commitment to work together\nin achieving specific goals in areas such as peace,\nsecurity and disarmament, human rights, good\ngovernance and poverty eradication. Those goals are\nall underpinned by a strong belief in the principles of\nmultilateral cooperation and shared interests.\nOf special significance to us are the commitments\nmade by the world leaders in the Millennium\nDeclaration to meet the special needs of Africa. That is\nnot only because Africa has the largest number of\ncountries classified as least developed, and in which\nalmost half the population lives in abject poverty. It is\nalso because we have all benefited and stand to benefit\nfrom each other's resources.\nIn spite of its current level of overall\ndevelopment, Africa has a lot to offer to the rest of the\nworld. Of course, we Africans realize our\nresponsibility, first and foremost, to develop and\nimplement strategies for improving the quality of life\nof our people and for strengthening our capacity to\ncontribute more effectively to the economies of our\npartners in the developed world.\n6\n\nIn effect, that is what the New Partnership for\nAfrica's Development (NEPAD) is all about \u2014\npartnership among African countries, partnership with\nthe rest of the world and progress for all mankind. It is\nin that context that the conclusions reached at the high-\nlevel meeting of the Assembly earlier this week on\nways and means of supporting NEPAD assume\nsupreme importance for my country.\nIn a similar vein, Sierra Leone also welcomes the\ncommitment of the eight major industrialized countries,\nthe G-8, at their recent meeting in Canada, to provide\nstrong support to NEPAD and to establish enhanced\npartnerships with African countries whose performance\nreflects the NEPAD commitments. Sierra Leone, for its\npart, is determined to pursue vigorously the objectives\nset out in NEPAD, not just because we need donor\nassistance at this time, but more so because we believe\nin the soundness of those objectives as a vehicle for the\neradication of extreme poverty, the achievement of\nsustainable development and the assumption of greater\nresponsibility for our own destiny.\nI began by assuring the Assembly that I came this\ntime with one overwhelming feeling, a feeling of joy\nover recent developments in my country. Of course, the\nsearch for sustainable peace with justice and national\nreconciliation is a continuous process, and we are well\naware of the challenges that we still have to face.\nHowever, I can say with confidence that what we have\nso far achieved, with the support of the United Nations\nand the international community, has provided the\nmomentum for us to meet those challenges.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I would like\nto take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan\non his assumption of the presidency of the fifty-seventh\nsession of the General Assembly. I am confident that\nhis diplomatic skill and expertise will bring us to a\nsuccessful outcome. I would also like to express our\ngratitude and appreciation to his predecessor, His\nExcellency Mr. Han Seung-soo, for his leadership and\nvaluable contribution during the previous session.\nMay I also use this occasion to warmly welcome\nSwitzerland as a new Member of the United Nations,\nand East Timor, which is soon to become a Member. I\nam confident that the work of the Organization will be\nenriched by the addition of those two new Members.\nThe increasing membership of the United Nations truly\nreflects the fact that States are placing greater trust in\nthe relevancy and the work of the Organization.\nWe live in challenging and dangerous times.\nConflicts in various regions threaten global peace and\nsecurity. The danger posed by terrorism has become a\nglobal phenomenon. Millions of people the world over\nremain mired in the vicious circle of ignorance,\npoverty and disease. The United Nations plays an\nindispensable role in our collective endeavour to\novercome those daunting challenges.\nThe Charter of the United Nations provides us\nwith the bedrock principles for maintaining peace and\nsecurity. Those principles \u2014 sovereignty, territorial\nintegrity and the non-threat or use of force \u2014\ncontribute to multilateralism and have deterred global\nconflagration for nearly six decades. Those principles\nmust remain inviolate if we are to meet the daunting\nchallenges that confront us. Only through multilateral\naction can we hope to overcome those challenges.\nMyanmar strongly believes in the United Nations and\nthe multilateralism it represents as the best guarantee\nof global peace and security. We therefore share the\nview of the Secretary-General, who has said that \u201cAll\nStates have a clear interest, as well as a clear\nresponsibility, to uphold international law and maintain\ninternational order\u201d (A/57/PV.2).\nTerrorism poses a threat to all of mankind. Only\nthrough our collective endeavour can we hope to\novercome that menace. Pursuant to Security Council\nresolution 1373 (2001), we have taken necessary\nactions to combat terrorism. Myanmar was also among\nthe first countries to report to the Security Council's\nCounter-Terrorism Committee on their actions against\nterrorism. It promulgated an anti-money-laundering law\nin June with firm provisions to help suppress terrorism.\nMyanmar has submitted to the Committee a second\nreport, together with relevant documents, reflecting the\nlegislative and executive measures that we have taken to\ngive effect to the resolution. Here I wish to reiterate\nthat Myanmar is against terrorism in all forms and\nmanifestations and that it will extend full cooperation\nto the international community to fight that menace.\nIt is in our power to make the world a better place\n\u2014 a world of peace, a world of prosperity and a world\nfree of conflict. To do that, we must do away with\nhatred. We face numerous challenges today. We must\nwork together in a cooperative spirit to overcome the\ndangers and meet the challenges that confront us, be\nthey imposed by nature or induced by man.\nThroughout the ages the world has experienced\nmany natural catastrophes and calamities, including\nthose resulting in the extinction of dominant species.\nBut the greatest danger we face today is not from\nnature, but is caused by man.\nIt is therefore not only pertinent, but also vital, to\nrecall that the teachings of Lord Buddha, Jesus Christ\nand the prophet Mohammed all emphasize love and\ncompassion as the guiding light to bring hope to all\n17\n\nmankind. If we want a better future for mankind, we\nmust take to our hearts the teachings of those great\nreligions. We should let love and compassion guide us.\nOnly by doing that can we overcome our evil instincts\nsuch as hatred, anger and the desire for revenge. We\nmust all do away with animosity, jealousy, excessive\npride and self-centred behaviour.\nMany tragedies today, including the tragic events\nof 11 September, have their roots in hatred, animosity\nand violence. It is those negative forces that we must\naddress and overcome. Violence cannot be overcome\nwith greater violence. That would only drive the world\ntowards a vicious circle of increasing conflagrations\nand calamities. Only a reign of love and compassion\ncan put out the raging fire of hatred and violence. It is\nnot in hatred, but rather in love and compassion, that\nour future lies. Through the peaceful settlement of\ndisputes we can find greater security for us all.\nThe United Nations and the principles it\nenshrines is best placed to guide us to that path. The\nUnited Nations is the light that can guide us to the path\nof love, tolerance, compassion and caring. The United\nNations was born out of our desire to live together in\npeace with one another as good citizens of the Earth. It\nshould not be used as a vehicle for inciting hatred.\nWe live in an age of unprecedented prosperity,\nbut that prosperity is not shared by all. While some\nnations enjoy very high standards of living, the\nmajority remains in poverty. The poor countries, either\nbecause of resource constraints or a lack of capital and\ntechnology, or because of conflicts, cannot hope to\nattain development without international cooperation.\nBecause of their innate weakness and an unfavourable\ninternational economic environment, they will, if\nunassisted, remain forever mired in poverty. Poverty\nbreeds discontent and despair \u2014 ingredients that could\nlead to a vicious circle of conflicts and violence.\nIn Myanmar, which was subjected to untold\nsufferings as a result of insurgencies for more than four\ndecades, we are now actively promoting an end to\nconflict and bloodshed. We are also striving to\neradicate poverty. We are building a modern and\ndeveloped nation where peace, prosperity, justice and\ndemocracy flourish. That is a process that has achieved\nsignificant progress. It is our fervent hope that our\nendeavours towards that end will be helped, not\nhindered, and that our efforts to attain national unity\nand our efforts at nation-building will be met with\nunderstanding and encouragement.\nBecause of historical legacies, we still find\nourselves having to address the issue of national unity.\nWe are building a nation where all our 135 national races\ncan regard one another as brothers, a nation where there is\nequality and justice, a nation that will bring prosperity to\nall. Those are the ideals that motivate us; those are the\ngoals that we are determined to achieve.\nIt is the goal of our Government to bring to\nreality the aspirations of the people of Myanmar to a\nmultiparty democratic political system. To that end, we\nare laying firm foundations so that such a democratic\nsystem will have the strength to withstand any\nchallenges that arise. We are firmly convinced that only\nthrough those strong foundations can we ensure a brighter\nfuture for our nation. That is a conviction born of our\nbitter experiences \u2014 experiences of 14 years under\nparliamentary democracy and 26 years of socialism.\nIn this nation-building process, we place special\nimportance on poverty eradication, particularly in rural\nand far-flung areas. In the border areas where the\nmembers of most of our ethnic nationalities reside, we\nare implementing a programme of all-around\ndevelopment. We have established 24 development\nzones towards that end. I should like to reiterate that\nour relentless efforts in the nation-building process are\nmotivated by our desire to bring prosperity to all our\nnational brethren. We are laying the groundwork so\nthat successive Governments, which will emerge under\nthe new Constitution, will not have difficulty in\novercoming future challenges. That is a task that we\nare endeavouring to accomplish with might and main.\nUnderstanding, cooperation and encouragement by the\ninternational community will hasten the process of\nachieving our cherished goal. Ostracism and political\npressure will surely not help, but will rather hinder, our\nprogress on the path to our cherished goal of\ndemocracy. However numerous the obstacles, whether\nwe are helped or hindered, we remain resolute in our\ndetermination, for the goal we seek is in fulfilment of\nthe aspirations of our people: it is our noble destiny.\nCooperation with the United Nations is the\ncornerstone of Myanmar's foreign policy. Let me take this\nopportunity to apprise the Assembly of the continued\ncooperation that Myanmar has extended to the United\nNations. We received Mr. Razali Ismail, Special Envoy\nof the Secretary-General, for the eighth time in July\n18\n\n2002. We provided all possible cooperation in the\naccomplishment of his mission. Likewise, Mr. Paulo\nSergio Pinheiro, Special Rapporteur of the Commission\non Human Rights, was accorded full and unhindered\ncooperation during his visits to Myanmar.\nI would also like to share with the Assembly the\nheadway we have made in combating the scourge of\nnarcotic drugs. The elimination of narcotic drugs was\ndesignated as a national duty in 1988, and since then\nefforts have been redoubled to meet that challenge. A\n15-year narcotics elimination plan has been formulated\nand is in its fourth year of implementation. The plan is\nshowing results. The United Nations International Drug\nControl Programme and the International Narcotics\nControl Board have acknowledged that poppy\ncultivation in the country has fallen from more than\n90,000 acres in 1999-2000 to a little more than 62,000\nacres in 2001-2002.\nAs part of our concerted effort, the New Destiny\nproject was launched earlier this year in the regions\nwhere poppy cultivation is concentrated. The main\nobjective of the plan is to educate poppy farmers, to\ndistribute substitute seeds, to provide financial\nassistance and to enhance law enforcement. As a result,\nmore than 290 tons of poppy seeds and dried poppy\nbulbs have been voluntarily surrendered. The\nsurrendered poppy seeds and bulbs were burned in the\npresence of diplomats and of the international press.\nThat alone has prevented a potential yield of 55 tons of\nheroin with an estimated street value of more than $2.2\nbillion. In addition, $1.1 billion worth of various\nnarcotic drugs seized in the country was publicly\ndestroyed in June in Yangon. Moreover, 26,000 acres\nof poppy fields were destroyed in 2000-2001 alone.\nEffective legal action has also been taken against drug\ntraffickers. As a country deeply committed to\naddressing the problem of narcotic drugs, Myanmar\nalso looks forward to contributing to that cause in the\ninternational arena.\nWe live in an increasingly integrated world. In\nthis age of globalization, a new partnership between\ndeveloped and developing countries is needed more\nthan ever before. The Millennium Declaration spelled out\ntargets for developmental cooperation. The Monterrey\nConsensus outlined actions to be implemented in key\nfinancial sectors pertaining to development. The World\nSummit on Sustainable Development resulted in some\nprogress and in important commitments. Their early\nimplementation will lead to a more equal distribution\nof benefits in this rapidly globalizing world. It will also\nenable us to pass on to future generations a world that\nis economically sustainable and environmentally\nsound. Myanmar stands ready to work with the rest of\nthe family of nations to attain those goals \u2014 goals to\nwhich we all pledged ourselves in the historic\nMillennium Declaration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We are meeting once again to find new\nperspectives in the light of the evolving international\nsituation in order to provide new impetus to our actions\nby coming together around common objectives.\nBefore continuing my statement, allow me, on\nbehalf of the delegation of Togo and on my own behalf,\nto address our warmest congratulations to Mr. Kavan\non his election as President of the General Assembly at\nits fifty-seventh session. His election to that high post\nis a tribute not only to him personally, but also to his\ngreat and beautiful country. I assure him of the fullest\ncooperation of my country towards the success of his\nmission.\nI also take this opportunity to convey to his\npredecessor our full gratitude for the effective way in\nwhich he led the work of the previous session.\nTo Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who works\ntirelessly to strengthen peace and security throughout\nthe world, we reiterate our high appreciation of his\ncommitment and dedication.\nI congratulate Switzerland and Timor-Leste on\ntheir admission into the great United Nations family.\nDemocracy, respect for fundamental freedoms\nand human rights and good governance are factors in\ndevelopment and peace and values to which Togo has\nlong adhered and to which we are deeply attached. It is\nin the spirit that we must consider the political reforms\nthat were launched 15 years ago at the initiative of our\nHead of State. These reforms seek to build a peaceful\ndemocracy based on the widest possible national\nconsensus and rooted in the historical and socio-\ncultural realities of our country.\nToday, our efforts have led to the establishment\nand effective operation of almost all the institutions\ncalled for in the Constitution of the Fourth Republic, to\nthe restoration of State authority and security and to the\nrevitalization of the national economy. We have\nachieved these results despite the difficulties that\nhindered the process of democratization as a result of a\npoorly begun transition, and despite all kinds of\nmanoeuvres and obstacles constantly set up by an\nunhelpful opposition. Priority has been placed above\nall on the continuation of political reforms to ensure\nthat they are undertaken in a climate of restored calm\nand ongoing concertation among all the political forces\nof our nation.\nIt was in this context that, at the initiative of the\nHead of State, Mr. Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyadema, we launched\nan inter-Togolese dialogue among all the country's\nprincipal political actors that led to the signing of a\nframework agreement in July 1999. The\nimplementation of that agreement allowed the\nestablishment of a dialogue between the Government\nand the opposition on such essential political questions\nas the organizational modalities of early legislative\nelections.\nIt was the will of the Head of State and of the\nGovernment to ensure that these elections, open to all\npolitical groups without exception, should take place in\na climate of peace and security, with the necessary\nguarantees of transparency and legality. It is also our\naim that, at the completion of this electoral process, a\nnew phase should begin in our country's political life\n7\n\nwith the revitalization of a National Assembly in which\npolitical groups that wish to be represented can be so.\nAll of these achievements, which strengthen\npolitical pluralism in Togo, deserve the support and\nencouragement of our partners, particularly those in\nEurope, with a view to normalizing our relations of\ncooperation. Unfortunately, that has not been the case.\nAs I stressed a year ago from this very rostrum, the\npeople of Togo do not deserve the treatment they have\nreceived. It is now clear that the rash imposition of\nsanctions as a means of political pressure entails limits\nbeyond which such measures become ineffective and\nrun counter to morality and to the duty of international\nsolidarity.\nI wish once again to launch an urgent appeal for\nthe resumption of the cooperation that Togo has a right\nto expect from the international community as an act of\nsolidarity, support and encouragement for the\nindisputable efforts that have been made by my\nGovernment towards the development of the country\nand the consolidation of the bases of our democracy in\na climate of peace, stability and national harmony.\nIt is well known that we in Togo have made peace\nand national security our credo, given that no\nundertaking for sustainable development can be\nsuccessfully carried out if the recourse to violence\nprevails over dialogue, concertation and mutual respect\nand if the world continues to face such terrorist acts as\nthe tragedy of 11 September 2001. Those terrible\nevents, which are still vivid in our minds, require us,\nindividually and collectively, to respond appropriately\nto the threats represented by terrorism. Togo, which has\nbeen a repeated victim of terrorist aggression,\nunderstands the importance of the challenge and spares\nno effort in assuming its share of the responsibility in\nthis struggle.\nWe must here welcome the speed with which the\nUnited Nations has reacted to this problem and\ncontributed to the emergence of an acute awareness of\nthe phenomenon and the dangers it entails for all\nmankind. Today, as was the case a year ago, it is\nimperative that we recognize the urgency and need to\npursue this campaign. It is clear that we must seek\ntogether the factors that will contribute to maintaining\npeace in all its dimensions.\nYes, crises and armed conflicts still afflict the\nworld, unfortunately, in Africa and elsewhere. While it\nmay be true that some glimmers of hope have emerged\nin Africa with the resolution of the conflict between\nEthiopia and Eritrea and with respect to the settlement\nof other crises, the situation remains alarming. It is\nalarming in the Great Lakes region and the Mano River\nregion, which is again experiencing a genuine security\nproblem, with major humanitarian consequences.\nWhether we are talking about the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, the Mano river region, the\nSudan, Somalia or any other country affected by crises,\nwe reaffirm that only dialogue and negotiation can lead\nto peace and ensure the lasting settlement of disputes.\nWe therefore urge the parties to such crises and armed\nconflicts to be more courageous and demonstrate\ngreater political will so as to give peace a chance\nthrough negotiating processes already under way and\nby respecting and effectively implementing the\nprovisions of agreements that have already been\nsigned.\nIn this respect, we welcome the recent\nannouncement of the withdrawal, beginning next week,\nof Rwandan troops from the eastern part of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, and we hope that\nthe implementation of this decision will strengthen the\nprocess under way.\nThe situation in the Middle East also remains\nworrying. We must find a solution to the vicious circle\nof violence \u2014 violence breeding violence. Togo has\nalways stressed that violence can lead only to bitterness\nand resentment and that it further perpetuates violence.\nThis cannot be said enough: dialogue and negotiation\nare the only means that should be used to settle\ndisputes. We therefore strongly urge both Palestinians\nand Israelis to end the vicious circle of violence and\nimmediately take up negotiations with a view to\nachieving a just, comprehensive and final settlement of\nthe question of Palestine, which is at the heart of the\nconflict in the Middle East. Of course, such a\nsettlement would require recognition of the legitimate\nrights of the Palestinian people, including their right to\na viable Palestinian State. But it would also entail the\nrecognition of the equally legitimate rights of the\nIsraeli people to live in peace and complete security\nwithin internationally recognized borders.\nThis session began just a few days after the\nconclusion of the World Summit on Sustainable\n8\n\nDevelopment, at which the international community\nstressed more than ever before the need to protect\nhumankind and the natural world. Now more than ever\nwe must protect humankind in its multifaceted\ncharacter and the environment in all of its variety.\nI am pleased to note, too, that this session of the\nGeneral Assembly is taking place during a historic time\nfor our continent of Africa. Indeed, two years ago, on\n12 July 2000, at Lom\u00e9, Togo, African countries laid the\ngroundwork for a new Africa by adopting, before the\nwhole world, the Constitutive Act of the African\nUnion. The African heads of State or Government\nsolemnly launched the new continent-wide\norganization at Durban in July, thereby translating into\nreality their determination to shape a new destiny for\nAfrica.\nSome might be tempted to say that, despite the\nestablishment of the African Union, nothing decisive\nwill be done and that the continent will still be trying\nto find itself while stagnating in underdevelopment. It\nis true that, given the current economic and social\nsituation, such pessimism could be warranted. Indeed,\nour continent of Africa is still the principal victim of an\neconomic order that is out of balance and unfair \u2014 one\nthat all too often deprives it of the fruits of its own\nlabour.\nUnstable commodity prices, yearly increases in\nthe price of crucial capital goods, debt, limited access\nto the markets of industrialized countries for our\nfinished and semi-finished goods and the competition\nwith which our products have to contend as a result of\nthe export subsidy policies of certain rich countries \u2014\npolicies that benefit their own industries \u2014 are\nseriously hampering the development of our countries.\nToday more than ever it is vital to ask how Africa\ncan reconcile the repayment of its debt with the\nimplementation of its economic growth and\ndevelopment goals. Turning the current situation\naround is a task that we must undertake through\nreflection and action.\nThe establishment of a new structure \u2014 the\nAfrican Union \u2014 marks a decisive turning point in the\nhistory of our continent, which, more than ever before,\nneeds the invaluable support of the international\ncommunity in carrying out its development\nprogrammes. We are aware that Africa cannot rise to\nthe challenge of growth and development unless it\nbecomes organized to mobilize and make the best use\nof its resources using external aid only as a\ncomplement to its own efforts. We earnestly hope that\nthe consolidation of various subregional organizations\nfor economic integration, together with the synergistic\nimplementation of the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment, will provide Africa with the means to\nachieve its ambitions.\nIn conclusion, I should like to stress that the new\ninternational context and the multidimensional nature\nof the problems to be faced mean that we must work\nwith greater determination and solidarity within the\nUnited Nations in order to push back insecurity,\npoverty and misery. In this regard, we must consider\nproviding this shared Organization with the\nwherewithal and the increased resources to enable it to\nachieve peace and economic and social development\nfor our peoples.\nThat is the price to be paid for the future of\nhumankind. I earnestly hope that the United Nations\nwill, more than ever before, become the ideal tool to\nimplement our ideals of peace, justice, progress and\nliberty for the benefit of our peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe smoke\nat ground zero, only a few blocks away from here, has\ncleared. But the empty space where the twin towers\nonce stood continues to send shivers throughout the\nworld. The unspeakable events that occurred a year ago\nhave become engraved in our collective memory. What\noccurred here was an unprecedented and direct attack\non universal values: values such as mutual respect,\nsuch as tolerance, such as the rule of law \u2014 values that\nform the very basis of the United Nations.\nOver the past year, the world community has\nproven its determination to defy terrorism. Today, the\nNetherlands not only reiterates its attachment to these\nvalues but also underlines a responsibility, both\nindividual and collective, for upholding and protecting\nthem. And that responsibility calls for a real\ncommitment.\nReligions, races and traditions make our world\ncolourful and diverse. But underneath our different\nfeathers, we share a common skin: principles we all\nadhere to \u2014 or should adhere to \u2014 regardless of our\nreligious beliefs or race. Mutual respect, the rule of\nlaw, freedom of speech and religion are among the\nmost important ones.\nWe cannot, however, confine ourselves to merely\nrestating these principles. Without real commitment\nthey would quickly evaporate and thus become empty\nwords.\nIt goes without saying that the Netherlands is\nfully committed: it is a dedicated international partner,\nboth out of choice and out of necessity, in the United\nNations, the European Union, NATO and other\norganizations, or in common endeavours such as the\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development. The\nNetherlands will continue to dedicate 0.8 per cent of its\nannual gross domestic product to development\ncooperation and urges others to do the same.\nBehind that commitment is the unshakeable belief\nthat no country can hope to succeed on its own in\nwhatever policy area. In this respect we take to heart\nthe wise words of Secretary-General Kofi Annan:\n\u201cEven the most powerful countries know that they need\nto work with others, in multilateral institutions, to\nachieve their aims\u201d (A/57/PV.2). We therefore also\nwelcome the United States decision, announced from\nthis rostrum by President Bush, to return to the United\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization (UNESCO). The Netherlands not only\nfeels an individual responsibility for the defence of\nuniversal values, but a shared responsibility as well.\nLet me elaborate on this today in relation to four key\nareas of concern: the development of the African\ncontinent, uncontrolled migration, the continuing threat\nof terrorism and the situation in the Middle East.\nAfrica continues its struggle towards\ndevelopment and prosperity. It cannot and must not do\nso all by itself. We all share a responsibility for\neradicating poverty and enhancing Africa's global\nintegration.\nToo often the African continent is associated only\nwith misery and instability. In reality the number of\nconflicts in or between African countries has\ndecreased. The creation of the African Union, and the\nNew Partnership for Africa's Development, testify to\nthe continent's own commitment. The Netherlands very\n15\n\nmuch welcomes this acknowledgement by African\nleaders of their own responsibility for building a\nprosperous and peaceful continent. For us, this is\nessential for adding our own efforts and resources to\nachieve that objective. It also means that African\nleaders, like all of us, can be held accountable for their\ngovernance and policies, their performance in the field\nof human rights and their respect for the rule of law.\nIn partnership with African countries the\nNetherlands will continue to do its share in providing\nthe necessary resources. For us, development\ncooperation is not just providing money, but also a\npolicy integrating the promotion of good governance,\nsecurity and stability. Is the world to assist in\nalleviating the effects of natural disasters when in fact\nthey are, at least in part, man-made?\nResponsibility also extends to the private sector,\nparticularly when it comes to fighting the disease that\nundermines all efforts at development: HIV/AIDS.\nHowever, for the fight against AIDS to be successful, it\nneeds to be fully endorsed by African Governments.\nThat means: acknowledgement of the problem and its\ncauses, an open discussion of possible strategies and\naddressing its consequences for society.\nAfrica concerns us all. Its problems affect us all.\nPoverty, conflict and violations of human rights\ncontribute to an ever-increasing migration. This\nphenomenon is, however, by no means unique for the\nAfrican continent. We need to deal with it effectively,\nregardless of whether we represent countries of origin,\ncountries of transit or those of destination. Migration is\nrobbing countries of origin of a vitally important\nresource: human capital. For neighbouring countries or\ncountries of transit it can be a source of instability. For\ncountries of destination, it often creates problems of\nintegration.\nHere again, common values are at stake.\nGovernments should do everything in their power to\navoid people having no other choice than fleeing home.\nThe number one priority is addressing the underlying\ncauses of uncontrolled migration.\nIn the meantime, we need to support the Office of\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\n(UNHCR), which is stretched to its limits dealing with\na problem for which it was not devised. The\nNetherlands welcomes UNHCR's efforts to establish\nand implement an integrated policy aimed at the\nrepatriation of refugees, coupled with their re-\nintegration, rehabilitation and reconstruction.\nObviously, these efforts have to be dovetailed with\nthose of other United Nations agencies active in those\nareas.\nIt is precisely through such an integrated\napproach that we can hope to achieve results.\nUNHCR's mix of policy areas obviously has to be\ncomplemented by that of security. That is one of the\nreasons why the Netherlands is involved in\npeacekeeping or similar operations in Bosnia, the\nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM)\nand Afghanistan. Security is the quintessential\nconsideration for those who are to return to their\nhomes. Without security, resettlement and recovery\nremain pious wishes. Money spent on security is\nmoney well spent.\nIn the year following 11 September 2001 the\ninternational community has effectively taken its\nresponsibility. Its joint efforts have focussed on\nbringing about more security and increased stability in\nAfghanistan. Much has been accomplished: a regime\nhostile both to the Afghan people and to our commonly\nshared values has been ousted. Subsequently, our\ncollective efforts have helped establish an elected\nGovernment and begin the reconstruction of a\ndisrupted society.\nThere can be no leniency towards countries that\nreject universal values, because a country that rejects\ntolerance, endorses intolerance. A country that does not\nguarantee the rule of law invites anarchy and injustice.\nThe international community must help countries that\nare unable to do so themselves. It must try to persuade\nthose that are uncooperative and it must be ready, if\nnecessary, to act against those that are unwilling.\nThe terrorist attacks have also shown that\nreligion, for some, unfortunately, is a source of\ninspiration not for good, but for destructive purposes.\nThe hijacking of planes should not result in the\nhijacking of an entire religion. Proper education,\nfreedom of opinion and speech, secular or\nrepresentative government can help contain religious\nextremism. Here again, we have a collective as well as\nan individual responsibility for upholding and\nprotecting common values.\nWhat we need is a dialogue between countries,\ncivilizations and religions. But we also need action to\ngo after the sources of religious extremism.\n16\n\nThat same commitment leaves us no choice but to\ncontinue to work towards peace in the Middle East.\nThe instability there, the lurking dangers of religious\nextremism and weapons of mass destruction require\nour joint dedication.\nThe many different actors in the Middle East\nshare a duty to restrain violence and curtail extremism.\nStability in the region is an indivisible interest, not\nonly for the region itself but far beyond. The countries\nin the region have prime responsibility for ensuring\nthat their citizens can live in freedom and an\nenvironment of tolerance and respect. But the\ninternational community has a role to play as well.\nHere in particular, we expect the Security Council to\ntake its responsibilities to end the Iraqi regime's\nsystematic non-compliance with a range of earlier\nresolutions. The inspectors should be allowed to return,\nyesterday rather than tomorrow. The credibility of the\nUnited Nations system is at stake.\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict cannot be dealt\nwith solely by concentrating on the fight against\nterrorism. Terrorism must stop, not only because of the\nhuman suffering it causes, but also because it is utterly\ncounterproductive. The Palestinian people should ask\nthemselves where this violence has got them. On the\nother hand, Israel cannot defer indefinitely answering\nthe question as to when and how it is to live side by\nside with a Palestinian neighbour. Finding a solution\nagain requires true commitment from all parties\nconcerned and a dialogue across regional, religious and\nother borders. That involves us all.\nIn conclusion, since we share values, we share\nresponsibility for upholding them. That should\ndetermine our commitment to addressing the problems\nthat I mentioned. Our commonly held values should\nguide our dealings with each other \u2014 between\nindividuals as well as between countries. It is only\nwhen we acknowledge what we have in common that\nwe can find the strength to overcome our differences. If\nthere is one thing that our presence here, one year after\n11 September 2001, makes clear, it is this: our belief in\nfreedom and tolerance is unshakeable, and so is our\ncommitment to uphold them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me begin by\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election as President\nof the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. I\nam also pleased to welcome Switzerland as a new\nMember of the United Nations.\n\n\nLet me acknowledge also two other significant\ndevelopments: the establishment of the African Union,\nand the creation of the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment. Both raise real hope for a new era of\npolitical stability and economic growth for Africa.\nWe meet at this General Assembly in the shadow\nof the terrorist attacks on this great city one year ago.\nThose chilling events were an attack on the values of\nthe great civilizations represented here today, values\nthat are central to the United Nations Charter and this\nOrganization.\nWe can take some comfort in knowing that the\ninternational community has responded, deliberately\nand resolutely, to international terrorism. The coalition\nin the war against terrorism  led by the United States\nand joined by others, including Australia  has\naccomplished a great deal. The Al Qaeda network in\nAfghanistan has been disabled. The Taliban regime has\nbeen defeated. Now the world is a safer and more\nhumane place.\nBut terrorism cannot be stamped out by military\neffort alone. Together we must choke off support \nfinancial and otherwise  for terrorism. We must stop\nthe patrons and bankrollers of the trade in terror, and\ntogether face this insidious threat. The decisive\nresponse of the United Nations after 11 September,\nembodied in Security Council resolution 1373 (2001),\ncreated a framework for Member States to join forces\nin suppressing, prosecuting and punishing terrorist acts\nand terrorist financing.\nAll Member States must implement the\ncommitments made in resolution 1373 (2001).\nAustralia has strengthened its counter-terrorism\nlegislative and law enforcement framework. We are\nparty to 10 of the 12 anti-terrorism instruments and\nwill ratify another later this month. Australia is also\nassisting other countries in the Asia-Pacific region to\nimplement their obligations.\nWe face another grave threat to international\npeace and security, one that tests the very authority of\nthe United Nations. For over a decade, Iraq has flouted\nlegally binding obligations to disclose and eradicate its\nprogrammes for weapons of mass destruction. Iraq has\ndefied United Nations resolutions, United Nations\ninspections and United Nations sanctions, and it has\nignored some 23 of the 27 United Nations obligations\nimposed on it under 16 Security Council resolutions.\nThe Secretary-General has been patient, flexible and\nassiduous in his efforts to get Iraq to comply with\nCouncil resolutions. But Iraq has refused to work with\nthe United Nations in efforts to dismantle its\nprogrammes for weapons of mass destruction.\nUntil this occurs, Iraq is a grave threat to its\nneighbours and to the world. Iraq's well documented\naggression towards its neighbours and its past use of\nchemical weapons underline the potency of the threat it\nposes. Grave concerns remain about Iraq's present\ncapabilities.\nUp until 1998 United Nations weapons inspectors\ndid much good work in finding and destroying Iraq's\nweapons of mass destruction program. But the work of\nthe United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM)\nwas never finished, because in 1998 the inspectors\nwere effectively thrown out of Iraq. Four years later,\nthere is little doubt that Iraq has been working hard to\nrebuild its chemical and biological weapons\nprogrammes. Moreover, serious questions also remain\nabout Iraq's nuclear weapons programme.\nThis state of affairs cannot be left unresolved.\nIraq must give immediate, unconditional and\nunrestricted access to inspectors to all areas, facilities,\nequipment, records and Iraqi officials. In short, Iraq\nmust fulfil the requirements of all relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions. If Iraq has nothing to hide, then it\nhas nothing to fear. Indeed, by meeting these demands,\nIraq and its people have everything to gain.\nLet us also be very clear: Iraq's flagrant and\npersistent defiance is a direct challenge to the United\nNations, to the authority of the Security Council, to\ninternational law, and to the will of the international\ncommunity.\nWe cannot stand by and allow ourselves to be\nignored. Nor must protracted negotiations be allowed\nto weaken and eventually paralyse efforts to allay fears\nabout Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. We all must\ndemonstrate a clear, collective determination to uphold\nthe authority of the Security Council, and to ensure that\nits resolutions on Iraq are implemented in full.\nOtherwise, if Iraq's pursuit of these abhorrent weapons\nis allowed to continue, we may shortly be asking\nourselves why we failed to act.\nThe terrorist threat has given new urgency to our\ndisarmament and non-proliferation goals, and puts\ndemands on us for a renewed effort to stop the spread\nof weapons of mass destruction  both to non-state\n25\n\nand state actors. We have to be alive to the willingness\nof terrorist groups to develop and use chemical,\nbiological or nuclear weapons.\nAustralia, for its part, intends to pursue practical\nand effective measures through international non-\nproliferation treaty regimes and export-control\narrangements. These regimes and arrangements have\ndelivered tangible security benefits, and should be\nsupported strongly.\nWe also need to deal with other transnational\nchallenges: not just terrorism but other transnational\ncrimes, including the smuggling of arms, drugs and\npeople.\nTransnational crimes threaten all countries. They\nrequire us to cooperate further in law enforcement,\nintelligence and financial controls  much like the war\non terrorism.\nPeople-smuggling and trafficking, in particular,\nare a truly transnational problem. This lucrative\ncriminal enterprise undermines the international\nrefugee protection system, and legal migration\nprograms, that have enabled millions to build new and\nprosperous lives in countries like Australia. Combating\npeople-smuggling and trafficking in persons is\nparticularly important to Australia and to the Asia-\nPacific region. This year, Australia co-hosted a\nregional ministerial conference with Indonesia.\nMinisters from thirty-eight countries committed\nthemselves to stopping the people who deal cold-\nheartedly in human cargo. We agreed that, in the first\ninstance, people-smuggling must be legislated against\nas a serious crime. There is much more we need to do,\nand Australia welcomes international discussion and\naction on the issue, including within the United\nNations system itself.\nAustralia welcomes the addition of the\nInternational Criminal Court to the international legal\nframework. It is an example of positive international\ncooperation which will complement the efforts of\nStates to end impunity for the worst violations of\ninternational humanitarian law.\nUnited Nations work in East Timor is another\noutstanding example of how the organization can, and\ndoes, make a difference  in this case in response to a\nhumanitarian crisis. In May we celebrated East Timor's\nindependence. We are now about to welcome East\nTimor as a new member of the United Nations. That we\nhave arrived at this point owes much to the resolve and\ncourage of the East Timorese. It owes much also to the\nUnited Nations and United Nations authorized missions\nthat brought stability and order and renewed hope for\nthe future.\nI congratulate the Secretary-General and the\nSecurity Council for providing the United Nations\nMission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) with the\nnecessary support, not just for peacekeeping and\npolicing, but also for developing stable governance in\nEast Timor. Sustained United Nations and international\nsupport will be critical in East Timor's formative years.\nAustralia is determined to provide such support. I\nwould like to pay tribute to Sergio Vieira de Mello's\nefforts in East Timor, and to congratulate him warmly\non his appointment as United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights.\nHIV/AIDS is a global issue that tears at the fabric\nof our society, and threatens the economic development\nof entire continents. The United Nations General\nAssembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS in June last\nyear brought home to Member States their\nresponsibilities to marshal national and regional\nresponses to HIV/AIDS. Australia hosted a regional\nministerial meeting in Melbourne in October 2001.\nMinisters agreed on the need to develop strategies to\nfight HIV/AIDS, and on the need to share lessons and\ncooperate in priority areas. We helped establish the\nAsia-Pacific Leadership Forum on HIV/AIDS and\nDevelopment to engender greater cooperation in the\nregion, and we applaud the appointment of a United\nNations regional envoy for HIV/AIDS.\nThe United Nations has a heavy agenda. But it\ncannot  and should not  try to do everything. To\nmake a difference it must be selective and focused,\nmatching its activities to its capabilities and to the\npriorities that we, the Member States, set for it. The\nMillennium Declaration gave us clear, agreed\npriorities. And the Monterrey Financing for\nDevelopment Conference and the Johannesburg\nSummit on Sustainable Development have built on\nthese, giving us a framework to shape and direct our\nwork. We also need to revitalize and reform the way in\nwhich the key organs of the Organization  the\nGeneral Assembly, the Economic and Social Council,\nthe Security Council  function. The Security\nCouncil, in particular, should be reformed, including by\nexpanding its membership.\n26\n\nWe also need to think again about the relationship\nbetween these organs and the Secretariat: time is not a\nfree good, nor are meeting services, nor are the\nSecretary-General's reports, and nor is the capacity or\nwill of Member States to provide resources without\nlimits. We need to look at how we can more effectively\nuse existing Unite Nations mechanisms  particularly\nthe General Assembly and the United Nations\nEconomic and Social Council (ECOSOC)  as bodies\nof review. And we are especially concerned that major\nUnited Nations conferences have become so large and\nunwieldy that their fundamental purposes have been\nobscured.\nAustralia strongly supports the process of reform\nproposed by the Secretary-General for his second term.\nThis provides a unique opportunity to address these\nquestions and to `re-tool' the Organization so as to\nbuild on its strengths. As Member States, we are the\nUnited Nations. The Organization is there to serve our\ncollective interests.\nIn order to address new threats and challenges,\nthe United Nations must be focused and responsive,\nand its key organs must function efficiently and\neffectively. We must continue to work together to\nenable it to meet our expectations. I am confident\nthat  together  we can achieve success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We welcome and indeed\ncongratulate those two countries and nations as they\njoin our family of nations.\nAs we meet here today, Lesotho and some other\ncountries of the southern African subregion are in the\ngrip of a most devastating and unprecedented food\nshortage, as a result of a combination of floods,\nunseasonable frost and drought, consequent upon\nclimatic changes that have hit the region in the recent\npast.\nOn 19 April of this year, when the Government of\nthe Kingdom of Lesotho declared a state of famine, it\nwas evident that over half a million people, out of a\ntotal of 2.2 million, faced a severe food crisis. Since\nthen, efforts have been made at the national level to\naddress the problem.\nLet me take this opportunity, on behalf of the\nGovernment and the people of the Kingdom of Lesotho\nand, indeed, on my own behalf, to express our gratitude\nfor the rapid response of the United Nations and its\nspecialized agencies and programmes and that of the\ndonor community to the crisis facing my country.\nHIV/AIDS, which has emerged as a major health\nand development threat, continues to be a source of\ngrave concern in my country. Most of those who are\ninfected are between the ages of 15 and 45 and\nconstitute the potential and active workforce in\nLesotho.\nOf equally great concern is the corrosive effect\nthat HIV/AIDS has on the family structure and on the\nsocial fabric of our society. We now have a large\nnumber of orphans and child-headed households. Those\nwho are sick not only lack adequate counselling and\nmedicine but also lack care and support.\nMy delegation therefore makes a special appeal to\nthe international community to provide adequate\nfinancial support for the African countries, in order to\narrest and, indeed, to redress the spread of HIV/AIDS.\nIn this regard, the efforts of the Secretary-General of\nthe United Nations in establishing the Global Fund to\nfight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are most\nwelcome. Indeed, Africa as a whole needs\nunconditional support in many other areas, particularly\nin the sectors of agriculture, health, nutrition, water\nand sanitation and education. Undoubtedly, there is a\nstrong link between poverty and the scourge of HIV/\nAIDS.\nThe Monterrey Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, the Doha Ministerial Conference on\ntrade and the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment provided useful forums for discussing\nsteps that must be taken to remove obstacles to\neconomic growth and sustainable development,\nparticularly in the developing countries. We are\nhopeful that commitments made by our cooperating\npartners mark a beginning of the process of helping the\nleast developed countries (LDCs) to translate goals and\ntargets of major global conferences and summits into\nconcrete actions. My delegation reiterates that the\nmarginalization of LDCs can be ended only if they are\nassisted in integrating profitably into the global\neconomy.\nAfrica took a very bold and decisive step recently\nin Durban, South Africa, in launching the African\nUnion. There is no doubt, as many may have observed,\nthat while the road to this Union was strewn with many\nobstacles, there is now some light at the end of the\ntunnel. This hope is premised on the principles that\nhave guided us in the last thirty-nine years of the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU). The Africa of\ntoday is committed to the principles of democracy,\nstability, peace, security, good governance and the rule\nof law. Above all, modern Africa is committed to good\neconomic management because it is, indeed, the\nmismanagement of our economies that has often led to\nconflicts on the continent.\n5\n\nThe New Partnership for Africa's Development\n(NEPAD) is a home-grown African strategy and an\nAfrican Union programme for Africa's development. It\nis a commitment by African leaders to eradicate\npoverty and to place the continent on a path of lasting\ngrowth and development. My delegation, therefore,\nappeals for more international support for NEPAD. We\nbelieve that the role of the entire international\ncommunity in supporting NEPAD, and the role of the\nUnited Nations in the coordination and synchronization\nof activities related to ensuring its success, would\nindeed provide a fresh impetus for Africa's\ndevelopment.\nThe right of a people to self-determination is a\nhuman right and a fundamental principle enshrined in\nthe Charter of the United Nations. The peoples of\nWestern Sahara and Palestine, therefore, deserve no\nless. Hence, my delegation urges that efforts to\nemancipate these nations be strengthened and speeded\nup.\nLesotho is gratified that one of the oldest and\nlongest running conflicts in Africa has finally come to\nan end with the signing of the ceasefire in Luanda,\nAngola, early this year, by the representatives of the\nNational Union for the Total Independence of Angola\n(UNITA) and the Government of Angola. However,\nLesotho and other Southern African Development\nCommunity (SADC) countries, as well as the\ninternational community at large, are alarmed by the\nharsh social and economic conditions that confront\ninternally displaced persons and refugees who return to\ntheir homes in Angola.\nWe appreciate the efforts of the entire United\nNations system to address this situation. We are of the\nview that a lot more still needs to be done for the\nAngolan people, including the provision of significant\nadditional resources as called for by the United Nations\nSecretary-General, in order to address the humanitarian\nneeds of the people of Angola.\nDespite the temporary disruption of the ceasefire\nnegotiations, my delegation is convinced that the\nMachakos Protocol signed between the Government of\nthe Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation\nMovement and Army, remains a viable framework for\nthe realization of durable peace in the Sudan. We urge\nthe warring parties to return to the negotiation table in\nearnest and in good faith.\nThe situation in the Democratic Republic of\nCongo has also been a source of concern to us all. We\nwish to congratulate the Governments of the\nDemocratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Uganda\nfor the signing of the peace agreements, which should\npave the way for the withdrawal of troops from the\nDemocratic Republic of Congo. We believe that this\nwill also ensure that the security concerns of the\nneighbouring countries are adequately addressed,\nwhilst at the same time creating conditions that are\nconducive for the Congolese people to live in peace in\ntheir own country.\nTerrorism has become one of the most pressing\nconcerns of the international community in recent\ntimes. The Government of Lesotho has joined other\npeace-loving members of the international community\nin waging war against this heinous crime.\nThe Government of Lesotho is committed to the\nfull implementation of Security Council resolution\n1373 (2001), and, despite financial and technical\nconstraints, we will continue to discharge our\nobligations, as stipulated in that resolution.\nThe shocking images of atrocities perpetrated in\nRwanda and in the former Yugoslavia will forever be\nembedded in our minds. They have served as a painful\nreminder to the international community that such\ncrimes should never go unaccounted for and their\nperpetrators unpunished. In that spirit we hail the\nlandmark agreement reached between the United\nNations and the Government of Sierra Leone to\nestablish an independent special court for the\nprosecution of those responsible for the serious decade-\nlong crimes against humanity committed in the\nterritory of Sierra Leone. We hope that the creation of\nthis special court will contribute greatly to the process\nof national reconciliation and healing, as well as to the\nrestoration and maintenance of peace in Sierra Leone.\nThe Government of Lesotho reveres the coming\ninto force of the Statute of the International Criminal\nCourt, a momentous period when the countries of the\nworld affirmed their intolerance of those who commit\ncrimes against humanity with impunity. We therefore\ninvite those States that have not yet done so, to become\nparty to the Statute, so that we may embark on this\nnoble but difficult pursuit in solidarity.\nI should not conclude this statement without\nmaking reference to the issue of the reform of the\nSecurity Council. The process of democratization is,\n6\n\nindeed, very difficult, and yet inevitable. It essentially\ninvolves a lot of compromise and understanding on the\npart of those who cherish and uphold the basic tenets of\ndemocracy and equality of States. My delegation\ntherefore wishes to reiterate its concern that this organ\nof the United Nations, which is charged with the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, has\nitself not yet moved to be more inclusive and more\nrepresentative. Here again, efforts need to be redoubled\nand the pace accelerated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn 21 September 1981\nBelize joined the community of nations as an\nindependent country, and we the people of Belize\nenthusiastically embraced our role as a partner in the\ncommunity of nations.\nThe United Nations played a pivotal role in\nsecuring Belize's right to self-determination, and, as\nwe commemorate our independence, we express our\nappreciation and continued support for the work of the\nOrganization.\nSince its inception in 1945 our United Nations\nhas, like all of us, been grappling with the constant\nchanges in our world. In its imperfection it has endured\nthe problems of infancy, puberty and adolescence. Each\nadjustment provided occasions for learning and\nopportunities for growth. No, we have not always\ngrown for the better; and we have suffered the cost of\nour mistakes.\nStill the United Nations endured, for the\nprinciples of the Charter will reverberate as loudly\ntomorrow as they do today and did yesterday. Our right\nto live peaceful and dignified lives holds as true today\nas it did in 1945.\nTwo years ago world leaders assembled here in\nNew York in an effort to rejuvenate the United Nations.\nThis resulted in the Millennium Declaration and\nbrought forth the Millennium Development Goals.\nIn these instruments we acknowledged the\ngrowing abyss between the few with plenty and the\nmany with nothing. We made new commitments and\nreaffirmed old ones. We renewed yet again our ultimate\ngoal of the improvement of humanity, a goal which we\nundoubtedly hold as sacred.\nSince then we have held many meetings and\nconferences where we have merely recycled ideas and\nvisions. Now we must aim for higher standards and\nmake the case that, as a global community, we are\nobligated to account for how we have chosen to\nimplement the many commitments we have made.\nFor us implementation is a function of resources;\ngood governance, both locally and globally; shared\nresponsibility; and partnerships. The implementation of\nthe Millennium Declaration can be effective only\nthrough the participation and cooperation of all\nrelevant stakeholders.\n\n\nIn order to ensure that the process of\nimplementation is democratized, inclusive, transparent\nand accountable, we must act with shared\nresponsibility and in partnerships of mutual respect and\nequality. As we follow the road map for the\nimplementation of the Millennium Declaration, our\ndeliberations and, even more so, our commitment to the\nMonterrey Consensus and to the Plan of\nImplementation of the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment should result in meaningful change that\nwill improve the lives of our poorest peoples.\nOn 5 February 2002, Belize hosted the first-ever\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM), System of Central\nAmerican Integration (SICA) and Dominican Republic\nsummit. In the joint declaration issued at the\nconclusion of the summit, the Caribbean and Central\nAmerican leaders agreed to strengthen their\ncooperation and to coordinate actions in areas such as\neducation, health, poverty elimination, environment,\ntrade and investment. Shortly our Foreign Ministers\nshall conclude a Plan of Action to implement the goals\nset out in the declaration.\nThe present development paradigm requires\ndynamic partnerships. Belize intends to play its part in\nencouraging closer collaboration and cooperation\nbetween Central America and the Caribbean.\nA major hindrance to development is conflict; it\nis costly and causes unnecessary pain and suffering,\noften to innocent victims. My delegation is concerned\nabout any notion that violence could be a solution to\nconflict. History has taught us that lasting peace can\nnever be constructed in a climate of vengeance.\nIn this regard we express our grave concern over\nthe continuing deterioration of relations in the Middle\nEast, especially with respect to the Palestinian people.\nThe escalation of violence in the region demonstrates\nthe urgent need for the parties to resume peace\nnegotiations.\nThe universally endorsed vision of two States,\nIsrael and Palestine, living side by side in peace within\nsecure and recognized borders, as called for by the\nSecurity Council in resolution 1397 (2002), should be\nrealized as soon as possible.\nWe encourage the efforts of the United Nations in\nfacilitating a peaceful resolution to the question of\nWestern Sahara and support the Settlement Plan as a\nviable political solution to the dispute.\nConflict in its many manifestations finds its\nbreeding ground in human desperation, frailty and\nignorance. If we can address the needs of the\ndisaffected and the vulnerable, then we can stamp out\nthe embers of conflict and increase the potential for\ninternational peace and security. Yes, we must address\nthose conditions according to our national capacity, but\nwe cannot go it alone. A multilateral approach is\nimperative.\nBelize continues to look to the United Nations for\nthe global enforcement of human rights standards. On 1\nJuly 2002, the international community witnessed the\nentry into force of the Rome Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court. As a State Party to the\nStatute, my Government will abide by its legal\nobligations thereunder and will uphold the integrity of\nthe Court. It is our hope that all peace-loving and law-\nabiding nations of the world will become parties to the\nRome Statute so that the universal jurisdiction of the\nCourt can be realized. The Court presents the hope that\nthere will be an end to impunity for the perpetrators of\ngenocide, of other crimes against humanity and of war\ncrimes. We see this as the start of a new system of\ninternational justice.\nAt this session of the General Assembly, we will\nbe witnessing the expansion of the representative\ncharacter of the United Nations. We recognize the\ntremendous contribution that the Swiss Confederation\nhas made in international relations, particularly with\nrespect to human rights and humanitarian issues. Its\ndecision to become a full member of the United\nNations will greatly enhance our work.\nLikewise, we are pleased to welcome the\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste to our family of\nnations. Its struggle has been long and arduous, and its\nadmission is a testament to the indispensable role of\nthe United Nations.\nIt is our wish that the United Nations be the\nforum for the representation of all peoples of the world,\nincluding the 23 million people of the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan. We must give true meaning to the\nprinciple of universality set forth in the Charter and,\nmore specifically, to the affirmation therein of our faith\nin fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth\nof the human person, in the equal rights of men and\nwomen and of nations large and small.\nWith the support of the United Nations, Belize\nbecame an independent nation. Before and after that\n12\n\ntime, we made every effort to resolve the territorial\ndispute between Belize and Guatemala, which we had\ninherited from colonial times. All previous attempts\nhad proved futile, but in March 2000, at the start of this\nmillennium, Guatemala and Belize agreed to initiate a\nunique process to resolve the dispute. Each of us\nappointed a Facilitator and asked the Secretary-\nGeneral of the Organization of American States (OAS)\nto be honour witness to the process.\nI am happy to be able to announce that, just\nyesterday, at OAS headquarters, the Facilitators\npresented their proposals for a peaceful and definitive\nresolution of the territorial dispute. The proposals must\nbe submitted by referenda to the peoples of both\ncountries, and only if accepted by both countries will\nthey be translated into treaties of settlement that will\nbring this age-old dispute to an end and create better\nconditions for harmonious cooperation between the two\ncountries  something for which both our peoples\nyearn. We fervently hope that that will indeed come to\npass.\nAn essential aspect of the proposal involves a\ndevelopment trust fund, and we wish to thank all the\ncountries that will generously contribute to making\npossible the peaceful settlement of a territorial dispute\nthat has adversely affected relations not only between\nthe countries involved, but also between the two\nsubregions to which Belize belongs  the Caribbean\nand Central America.\nFour days from today, our people will assemble\nand re-enact the events of our Independence Day. It\nwill also be a time to renew our commitment to the\nprinciples of justice and liberty, to the right of a people\nto self-determination, to the right to development and\nto our continued commitment to live in peace with our\nneighbours. That is the legacy of the United Nations;\nthat is our just objective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOne year has gone by\nsince the terrorist attack on the United States, which\ninflicted such deep wounds on the city that welcomes\nus today. By striking this city, this nation, this\ndemocracy, the terrorists intended to strike at the heart\nof the whole community of nations and peoples that\nembraces the United Nations and the values for which\nit stands.\nBut they failed in their purpose. Instead, their\nbarbarous acts roused in all of us a common will to\nrespond. Rather than divide us, they united us. And\nunited we intend to respond to every new threat to\nworld security.\nThe fight against terrorism is the crucial\nchallenge we must face today in order to defend human\nvalues  the values of freedom, peace, justice and\ndevelopment which we all share.\nThe United Nations is at the forefront of this\nstruggle. We know that it will be a long and hard battle,\nand we must therefore maintain the cohesion and\ndetermination that we have shown so far.\nBut we are firmly convinced that this battle can\nbe won. Yesterday President Bush recalled the\nresponsibilities that we all share in this fight to defend\nfreedom, which is the greatest good and that from\nwhich all other goods flow. Terrorism finds a breeding\nground wherever there is no freedom, wherever there is\nno democracy, but where there is hunger, misery and\ndespair.\nIn order to defeat terrorism, we must globalize\nfreedom and democracy. In order to eradicate\nterrorism, we must promote an economic development\nwithout borders  a lasting development for all.\nMy country has played a role in this struggle\nfrom the start and will continue to do so to the end,\nenhancing the military, financial, judicial, police and\nintelligence cooperation that has already achieved\nimportant results. But we are also working to eradicate\npoverty and disease. We are committed to pledging\n0.39 per cent of our gross domestic product to less\ndeveloped countries, and we intend to reach the level\nof 0.7 per cent.\nThe African continent is crucial to our effort. It is\na challenge to our conscience and represents a test of\nour ability to help its countries to participate in a true\ndevelopment without borders.\nThe Group of Eight's action plan for Africa,\nlaunched in Genoa under Italy's presidency and\napproved in Canada, responds to the need for a new\nform of solidarity between the most industrialized\ncountries and those which intend to become the owners\nof their future.\nBut an increase in financial aid is no longer\nenough. At the Kananaskis summit, we presented an\naction plan aimed at achieving common standards of\ngood governance, starting with our e-government'\ninitiative, a completely computerized and digitalized\nuniversal model of public accounting and of public\nadministration and its primary functions.\nThe adoption of this universal model, which\nrespects the identity, traditions and culture of each\ncountry, could produce several positive effects: clear\nand transparent public accounting; clear laws and\nregulations befitting the rule of law; more efficient\nservices for citizens and businesses; greater efficiency\nin public administration; and, above all, greater\ndemocracy. This will spark a virtuous circle, and donor\ncountries will finally have the certainty that their\nassistance is truly delivered to needy populations.\nIn this respect, three phases were outlined at the\nGroup of Eight meeting. In the first trial stage, the\nnecessary assistance will be provided to the countries\nthat wish to adopt this system. At the end of this phase,\nwhich might last three or four years, we can move on\nto a second phase in which the adoption of the\nuniversal system becomes a requirement for all\ncountries that apply for development assistance.\nFinally, there could be a third phase in which we\ncould ask the most industrialized countries to forge a\n23\n\nspecial partnership with specific countries, taking it\nupon themselves to implement specific projects.\nWe are likewise convinced that public assistance\nshould be supplemented by private assistance. At\nKananaskis, we submitted an innovative proposal\ncalled de-tax', whereby private citizens would be able\nto allocate between 1 and 2 per cent of the price of\nwhat they buy to the implementation of specific\nprojects, such as schools, hospitals or water-supply\nfacilities in poor countries.\nAt Genoa we also launched the Education for\nAll' plan and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,\nTuberculosis and Malaria, to which Italy has pledged a\nsubstantial contribution.\nBut the poorer countries also need to be relieved\nof the burden of their debt so as to free up the\nresources they need for their growth. That is why Italy\nhas already cancelled $1 billion of debt and will soon\ncancel another $4 billion, until the complete write-off\nof all its credits.\nOur commitment to the United Nations is clear on\nall fronts. Italy is the sixth-largest contributor to the\nOrganization's regular budget and one of the largest\ntroop contributors. About 10,000 Italian soldiers are\ndeployed throughout the world, from the Balkans to\nAfghanistan, to preserve and maintain peace and\nsecurity. We will continue along that road, in our firm\nbelief that there is no problem that we cannot solve if\nwe are united in our determination.\nAs we speak today, the main challenge to the\nUnited Nations and our system of values is posed by\nthe regime that governs Iraq, which has systematically\nignored all the resolutions of the United Nations. A\nresponse is indispensable to safeguard the international\ncommunity from the danger posed by a massive build-\nup of weapons of mass destruction.\nAs President Bush so clearly stated, what we\nmust address today is precisely this repeated defiance\nof the United Nations and of the will of the\ninternational community. We must make use of all the\ndiplomatic and political means available to address this\nsituation. But if things do not change substantially, it\nwill be necessary to act within the framework of the\nUnited Nations in order to safeguard global security\nfrom a real threat.\nThe lesson we must draw from the events of 11\nSeptember is that haste can lead to carelessness, but\ndelay in taking the necessary action can have terrible\nconsequences. When terrorist attacks or threats to\npeace are carried out by networks or regimes that aim\nat destroying our way of life and our liberal\ndemocracies, then democracies have not only the right\nbut also the duty to defend themselves.\nLet me now turn our attention to the Middle East.\nItaly supports the road map drawn up by the European\nUnion, as well as the action of the quartet' and the\nrapid convening of an international conference to\nensure the peaceful coexistence of two independent\nStates within safe and secure borders.\nFirst of all, the spiral of violence must come to an\nend through the cessation of terrorist attacks. The\nholding of free and fair elections will advance the\nprocess of democratic reform of the Palestinian\nNational Authority. But a lasting peace cannot be\nenvisaged unless we narrow the economic gap between\nthe Israelis and the Palestinians, giving the Palestinians\nrealistic hope for jobs and development. With this goal\nin mind, Italy has presented a plan to rebuild and\nsupport the Palestinian economy. Italy has already\noffered to host the negotiations and the peace\nconference.\nWe are men and women of peace. We are\nconvinced that this new century cannot be left at the\nmercy of criminal folly and fanaticism. We are\ncommitted to the fight against terrorism, and we will\ndo everything in our power to eradicate that evil and to\ndefend our security and our future. We will lend our\nefforts to the building of a true and just peace, the only\nkind of peace for the just and the free.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We are convinced that his\nknowledge and diplomatic experience will guide us to\nsuccess in our activities.\nAs the international situation remains caught in\nthe throes of instability, insecurity, economic\nbackwardness and the scourge of pandemics and\nhunger, we nevertheless note with pleasure the great\nprogress that has been made since our last session.\nAfter decades of conflict, peace was finally restored\nthroughout southern Africa and is now slowly\nbecoming a reality in other regions. The people of East\nTimor were finally able to assert their self-\ndetermination and independence. Countries such as\nAngola, which have actively advocated the legitimate\nrights and interests of East Timor at the United\nNations, take great pleasure in welcoming that new\nsister republic to the family of this world Organization.\nImportant advances were also made by the\ninternational community in the struggle against\nterrorism. Thanks to a global and coordinated effort,\nmajor terrorist networks have been dismembered.\nAngola reiterates its strong condemnation of terrorist\nacts, such as that perpetrated against the American\n22\n\npeople in September last year. Angola continues to be\ncommitted to the strict implementation of Security\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001). We support stronger\ncontrol measures, particularly in the financial area, so\nas increasingly to curb the scope of action of terrorist\ngroups.\nAll these advances underscore the fact that, in\nspite of their complexity, the serious problems that\nafflict our world today can be resolved. No country or\nregion should be doomed to live forever under the\nscourge of war and terror or be deprived of its rights.\nUnder the auspices of the United Nations, the\ninternational community must react to crisis situations\nexpeditiously and effectively. Experience has shown\nthat belated and ineffectual reactions lead to the\nescalation of protracted and intractable conflicts,\nespecially in Africa. Fortunately, however, the\nindividual and collective efforts of many Governments\nin Africa are now easing these tensions, laying the\nessential bases for a solid, just and lasting peace.\nThe current situation in Angola is a reflection of\nthat reality. For the first time since our independence,\nAngola and Angolans are now enjoying a climate of\nauthentic peace, thanks to the allaying of factors that\ncould have provoked a resurgence of the past war and\ninsecurity. The efforts of the Angolan Government\nhave blazed the trail from a fratricidal war towards\nirreversible peace, thanks to the goodwill and profound\npatriotic spirit demonstrated by all Angolans. Military\nhostilities effectively ended seven months ago. The\npeace understandings reached on 4 April have been\nscrupulously adhered to. Armed political parties no\nlonger exist. Today, there is just one single army, under\nthe authority of the Angolan Government.\nThe peace process will soon be concluded with\nthe completion of the political tasks still pending under\nthe Lusaka Protocol. In Angola, the process of\neconomic and social rehabilitation is well under way\nand Government institutions have begun to operate\nnormally throughout our national territory.\nClearly, given the current situation, it will be\ndifficult for the Angolan Government to rise\nappropriately to the nation's economic and social\nchallenges. Our main challenge now lies in the\nreintegration into society of thousands of combat\nveterans, 4 million displaced persons, refugees and\nthousands upon thousands of handicapped, war orphans\nand widows.\nOn behalf of my Government, I would like to\navail myself of this opportunity to thank the Secretary-\nGeneral, members of the troika of observer nations in\nthe peace process and all those who, in various ways,\nhave contributed to the achievement of peace in Angola\nand who have pledged their assistance to solve the\nproblems caused by the recently ended war.\nNow at peace, Angola is more than ever ready\nand willing to take up its role as a sister nation of\nAfrica and of the world. In the coming days, it will\nassume the presidency of the Southern Africa\nDevelopment Community, the most important regional\norganization for the economic integration of southern\nAfrica. Angola is also a candidate for a non-permanent\nseat in the Security Council in the elections scheduled\nfor this session of the General Assembly. In these\nbodies, Angola intends to contribute actively towards\nan environment of stability, fostering the development\nand economic welfare of our peoples. Of central\nconcern to Angola is the issue of peace in Central\nAfrica, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo. Only over time will it be possible to avert the\nwidespread destabilization of the region.\nAngola has been a factor of stability in Central\nAfrica, having contributed substantially to the\ncessation of the wave of violence and to the relative\npeace now enjoyed by the population in the area.\nIn the context of these efforts, and under\nAngola's aegis, the Presidents of the DRC and Uganda\nsigned an agreement in Luanda on 6 September. This\nwas seen as a crucial step for the complete settlement\nof the Congolese conflict and for the establishment of\ngood neighbourly relations between the two countries.\nAngola welcomes the diplomatic initiatives\nundertaken by other countries to resolve the conflict,\nwhether or not they are involved in the conflict, under\nthe Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement and the\nunderstandings reached by the Congolese parties\nthemselves. Angola advocates a new regional order of\npeace, security, cooperation and development, to be\nbased on respect for sovereignty and territorial\nintegrity, non-intervention in the internal affairs of\nother States, democratic values and respect for human\nrights. We are willing to work together with other\ncentral and southern African countries and to offer\nthem our good offices.\nThe instability in some parts of the world requires\na greater measure of commitment by the United\n23\n\nNations and the parties concerned for peace and\nsecurity. Special attention should continue to be\nfocused on the settlement of the Somali conflict,\nfostering unification of the country and consolidation\nof lasting peace there. In Western Sahara, we are\nconcerned at delays in the process towards a\nreferendum by those resident in the territory. Angola\nurges the parties involved to show flexibility and to\ncontinue cooperating with the United Nations and the\nAfrican Union towards a negotiated settlement.\nIn the Middle East, renewed escalation of the\nviolence may hamper current initiatives towards a\npeaceful settlement of the Palestine issue and the\ntermination of Arab-Israeli crisis. We urge the parties\nto return to the negotiating table and to find a political\nsettlement that will serve the best interests of all\npeoples living in the region and meet their security\nrequirements.\nLast July, the African States established the\nAfrican Union as a more effective tool to help in the\nresolution of innumerable problems that are at the root\nof underdevelopment, such as poverty, foreign debt,\nlack of know-how and epidemics, among others. Our\npriority is to end the current economic stagnation in\nAfrica. The establishment of the New Partnership for\nAfrica's Development reflects the determination of\nAfrican Governments to resolve the problems of\neconomic backwardness, poverty and social exclusion\nthat afflict the majority of their peoples and the\ncontinuing marginalization of Africa from international\nmarkets in terms of capital, services and goods. Angola\nhopes that the international community, especially\ndonor nations, will lend Africa a helping hand by\nincreasing official development assistance on the basis\nof fair and non-discriminatory criteria.\nIn closing, allow me to offer my hearty\ncongratulations to Switzerland as it joins our family of\nmembers of the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Some\ncountries are still occupying the territory of others.\nThis is creating tension and instability in many regions\nof the world, which is endangering regional and\ninternational peace and security.\n14\n\nAs the international community faces an\nincreasing number of challenges, we are becoming\nmore aware of the importance of complying with the\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and of\nrespecting the sovereignty of international law in\nresolving, by peaceful means, disputes, conflict and\ninstances of occupation.\nIn this age of globalization and rapid\ndevelopment in information and communication\ntechnologies, the world has become a small village that\ncan be reached from anywhere. The different interests\nof the world's nations have become intertwined more\nthan ever. Thus the problems and sufferings of other\npeoples cannot be ignored because of geographical\ndistances or differences of culture, civilization and\nbeliefs.\nThe current events in the world prove, without a\ndoubt, that the outcomes of conflicts and wars and the\nproblems of poverty, drug abuse and disease extend\nbeyond their geographical borders, reaching secure\nregions and threatening their stability. For that reason,\nthe establishment of international peace and security in\nthe world is the joint responsibility of all Governments\nand nations, of their public as well as private\ninstitutions. The dire need for a global partnership,\nworking under the umbrella of the United Nations with\na view to creating a comprehensive and calculated\nstrategy that takes into consideration international law,\nhuman and cultural values and people's needs and\nsuffering can never be overestimated.\nThe United Arab Emirates is well aware of the\nstrategic importance of the Arabian Gulf region, and it\nis aware that the security of the Arabian Gulf cannot be\nseparated from international peace and security.\nFurthermore, the United Arab Emirates, guided by the\nwise leadership of His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin\nSultan A1-Nahyan, the President of the country,\nbelieves in solving disputes by peaceful means, based\non the principles of the United Nations Charter and the\nprovisions of international law. On that basis, the\nUnited Arab Emirates calls upon the Islamic Republic\nof Iran to solve the issue of its occupation of the three\nislands, Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb, and Abu Moussa,\nthrough bilateral talks or through the International\nCourt of Justice. We also reaffirm that the United Arab\nEmirates has complete sovereignty over these three\nislands, including their air space, their regional waters,\nthe continental shelf and the economic region related to\nthem, as they are an indivisible part of the United Arab\nEmirates.\nThe United Arab Emirates has more than once\nshown good will and a serious desire to reach a\npeaceful solution to the issue of the three islands. This\nwas done through two visits by his Highness, Sheikh\nHamdan bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, representing the\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, to Tehran, in addition to\nmutual visits made by the two parties. The United Arab\nEmirates hopes that those visits will contribute to\nbringing both parties closer and to reaching a peaceful\nsolution for the three islands. This will reinforce the\nprinciple of security and of regional and international\npeace. In addition, it will affirm the principle of\ndialogue, peaceful coexistence, trust and good\nneighbourliness.\nWe have witnessed, during this session, new and\nencouraging developments regarding the Iraqi issue\nand the security and stability of the region. The United\nArab Emirates welcomes Iraq's acceptance of the\nreturn of the United Nations inspectors, in\nimplementation of the relevant Security Council\nresolutions. This decision will spare Iraq and the region\nuntold tragedies and catastrophes. We look forward to\nreal cooperation, one built on the United Nations\nCharter and international resolutions, in order to reach\nstability and cooperation among the States of the\nregion and to resolve all remaining problems that\nhinder trust, stability and collaboration among the\ndifferent parties. We call upon the international\ncommunity to support the Iraqi decision, to exert\ngreater efforts to solve the pending issues between Iraq\nand the United Nations, and to lift the sanctions\nimposed on the Iraqi people and under which they have\nsuffered for 12 years. We welcome, furthermore, the\npositive attitude expressed by Iraq towards returning\nthe Kuwaiti national archives and properties. We urge\nit to show more goodwill and take more effective steps\nby freeing the Kuwaiti prisoners of war and those of\nthird countries, returning the rest of the Kuwaiti\nproperties, respecting the sovereignty of Kuwait and\nnot interfering in Kuwait's internal affairs.\nWe also reiterate the United Arab Emirates'\nposition with regard to the resolution adopted by the\nArab Summit in Beirut in March 2002. This resolution\nrejects the use of force or the threat to use it, along\nwith any military attack against Iraq. This position\naims to protect the region from another unnecessary\nwar. We reiterate, furthermore, the importance of\n15\n\nsecuring the sovereignty and territorial integrity of\nIraq.\nThe United Arab Emirates is very concerned\nabout the dangerous events in the occupied Palestinian\nterritories. We express our sympathy and solidarity\nwith the Palestinian people in their ordeal. We also\ndenounce all acts of aggression committed by the\noccupying Israeli forces, and we demand that the\ninternational community, in particular the large\ninfluential countries, the United States of America and\nthe European Union, compel Israel to end immediately\nall acts of murder, destruction, closure and\ndisplacement of the Palestinian people.\nThe United Arab Emirates renews its support of\nthe right of the Palestinians to self-determination and\nthe establishment of their independent State, with\nJerusalem as its capital. Accordingly, we reaffirm our\nsupport of the Arab peace initiative that was endorsed\nat the Beirut Summit. This initiative comprises a\nprocess for a just and comprehensive settlement that\nensures the rights of both parties. Such a position was\nexpressed by United States President George W. Bush\nin a speech calling for the creation of a Palestinian\nState.\nWe also call upon Israel to end its continuous\nviolations of the agreements it made within the\nframework of the peace process and to resume peace\ntalks in accordance with General Assembly and\nSecurity Council resolutions, in particular resolutions\n181 (1947), 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 1397 (2002), and\n425 (1978). These call for Israel's withdrawal from the\nPalestinian occupied lands, including the city of\nJerusalem, to the 1967 borders, from the Syrian Golan\nHeights to the line set before 4 June 1967 and from the\nLebanese Shabaa farms, and for the dismantling of all\nsettlements in occupied Palestinian and Arab lands and\nfor the return of Palestinian refugees to their homeland.\nMaintaining peace and security in the Middle\nEast and the Arabian Gulf region depends, to a great\nextent, on applying a more comprehensive and\ntransparent concept that entails the removal of weapons\nof mass destruction. The fact that Israel has these\nweapons, including nuclear weapons, is a direct threat\nto regional and international security. Accordingly, we\nagain urge the international community and relevant\ninternational organizations to pressure Israel, by all\nmeans possible, to abandon its nuclear weapons and to\nsubject its nuclear facilities to the supervision of the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. This proposal\naims to establish a nuclear-free zone, along with a zone\nthat is free of weapons of mass destruction, in the\nMiddle East and the Arabian Gulf, similar to other\nregions in the world.\nThe United Arab Emirates watches with great\nconcern the escalation in tensions between India and\nPakistan. We call upon these two countries to deal with\ntheir disputes in a spirit of joint political responsibility\nthat ensures the security of the region and the world.\nWe ask them to resume bilateral negotiations to resolve\ntheir standing disputes peacefully in order to maintain\nregional and international peace and security.\nInternational terrorism is a direct threat to the stability\nof nations and to international peace and the world\neconomy. In denouncing all acts of terrorism,\nregardless of their motives and sources, the United\nArab Emirates reaffirms its commitment to relevant\nUnited Nations resolutions on terrorism. It renews its\ncall for an international conference on terrorism to\nreach a clear definition of terrorism based on the\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and\nregional and international treaties, conventions and\ncovenants.\nPolitical and historical events have proven that\neconomic deterioration, poverty, lack of water, debts\nand foreign occupation pose dangerous threats to life\nresources and the security of human beings. They are a\nmain cause of conflicts, violence, ethnic cleansing and\ninstability. On that basis, the leaders of the world\ninsisted, in the Plan of Implementation and the Political\nDeclaration of the Johannesburg World Summit on\nSustainable Development, on the common and\ndifferentiated responsibility to solve these problems\nand on the importance of providing the financial\nresources to achieve the goals of economic, social and\nenvironmental development to eradicate poverty, raise\nstandards of living and achieve global economic\ndevelopment.\nThe United Arab Emirates calls on the\nGovernments of the developed countries to honour the\ncommitments they made in Johannesburg \u2014 especially\nwith respect to the developing and least developed\ncountries, as specified in the recommendations\nemanating from the Summit \u2014 and in particular the\nfinancial resolutions requiring the developed countries\nto contribute 0.7 per cent of their national production\nto help poor, developing States to implement\ndevelopment programmes in their countries.\n16\n\nWe call upon Governments and relevant\norganizations to comply with resolutions relevant to\nsustainable development. The United Arab Emirates\nhas consistently initiated and provided development,\nfinancial and humanitarian assistance to many\ncountries, especially developing countries, that suffer\nfrom civil and regional wars and natural disasters. We\nalso call upon the international financial institutions to\nadopt more balanced and fair financial policies to\nalleviate the developing countries' external debt\nburden. This would give them the opportunity to\nparticipate in formulating decision-making policies\nrelevant to the environment and sustainable\ndevelopment and to help them join the global market,\nthus reviving and enhancing their national economies.\nThey would thereby become productive members of\nthe international community, effectively promoting the\nstability of international economic relations.\nFinally, we hope that the debates on the items on\nthe agenda of this session will achieve positive and\nconcrete results, enhancing the role of the Organization\nin maintaining international peace and security and\nmaking the world a better place for human society.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the\noutset, I should like, on behalf of all the members of\nthe Chadian delegation that I have the honour to lead,\nand on my own behalf, to warmly congratulate Mr. Jan\nKavan on his election to the presidency of the fifty-\nseventh session of the General Assembly. In\ndischarging that heavy responsibility, he can count on\nmy delegation's full availability and support\nthroughout this session, all the more so since the\ninternational community has honoured my country by\nelecting it to one of the prestigious posts of Vice-\nPresident of the Assembly. I take this opportunity to\nexpress our gratitude to the Members of the\nOrganization for the trust placed in my country, Chad.\nMembers may be assured that we shall do our utmost to\ndeserve that trust.\nMy thanks and congratulations go also to\nMr. Kavan's predecessor and to his team for the work\naccomplished during the fifty-sixth session.\nI should also like to pay particular and well-\ndeserved tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, whose commitment and ceaseless efforts to\nachieve sustainable peace and development in the\nworld are welcome and should be recognized.\n Lastly, I express my sincere and warm\ncongratulations to the Swiss Confederation on its\nadmission to the Organization. Chad, which enjoys\nclose relations of friendship and cooperation with that\ncountry, welcomes its decision to join the great United\nNations family. A country devoted to democratic and\npeaceful values, Switzerland will undoubtedly\ncontribute to enriching our debates on all issues.\nThe current session is taking place one year after\nthe terrible attacks perpetrated against the United\nStates of America on 11 September 2001, which\nplunged American families and those of other nations\ninto mourning. The Government and the people of\nChad once again join the rest of the international\ncommunity in paying tribute to the memory of the\nthousands of innocent victims of that act of blind\nsavagery, which nothing can justify.\nUnfortunately, those sad events have brutally\nalerted us to the numerous challenges that we\nabsolutely must face if we wish to one day bring about\na just and equitable international society that enables\neach of its members to develop fully. In addition, those\nacts of despair can be checked only if their roots \u2014\nwhich are nourished by unequal international relations\nbroadening daily the gap between rich and poor \u2014 are\neradicated. My country firmly condemns that form of\npolitical expression, from whatever side it may come,\nand is ready to associate itself with any initiative of the\ninternational community to establish a new world order\nbased on democracy and sustainable development.\nToday, the United Nations is called on more than\never to help to establish a fairer and more prosperous\ninternational society. We note with satisfaction the\nOrganization's frequent efforts to ultimately eradicate\nthe scourges of disease and malnutrition \u2014 in short,\nthose of underdevelopment. In that regard, numerous\nworld meetings at the level of heads of State or\nGovernment have been organized under the auspices of\nthe United Nations or of specialized agencies with a\nview to implementing the decisions and\nrecommendations of the Millennium Summit. But the\npoint is not to have Summits; above all, we must match\nwords with deeds.\nThe Republic of Chad, like all other developing\nStates, aspires to a better life and well-being for its\npopulation. His Excellency Mr. Idriss Deby rightly\nstated, in his inaugural address on 8 August 2001, that\nhis mandate would have the double aims of peace and\neconomic progress. In order to do that, Chad is relying\non the early exploitation of its mineral and agricultural\nwealth. We take this opportunity to inform the\nAssembly and to reassure the international community,\nincluding the friends of Chad, that the work to carry\nout its oil project is proceeding under good conditions.\nAccording to forecasts, the first barrels of oil may be\nbrought to market starting in July 2003.\nHowever, despite the prospects offered to Chad\nby the oil age, the Government is aware of the\nweakness of the national economic structures, of the\ndebt burden and of the imbalances that make the\npopulation's living conditions precarious. Once again,\nwe call for our bilateral and multilateral partners to\nincrease their assistance and simply to cancel external\ndebt, as the African Union has always recommended.\nLong captive to its domestic problems, the\nRepublic of Chad, now more than ever before, intends\nto shoulder its responsibilities within the international\ncommunity, particularly on the level of the African\n13\n\ncontinent. Therefore, the Government is committed to\nhelping to make the African Union \u2014 whose birth was\ncelebrated on 9 July 2002 at Durban, South Africa \u2014 a\ngenuine instrument of the continent's political and\neconomic integration. The New Partnership for\nAfrica's Development (NEPAD) is part of that major\nobjective. In the framework of North-South and South-\nSouth cooperation, NEPAD deserves the support of\nAfrica's development partners.\nBut again, Chad is among those who think that\nAfrica's salvation lies in the hands of Africans\nthemselves. To that goal, they must take courageous\npolitical decisions and transcend their differences so\nthat the African Union can become a reality, because\nthe disruptions and crises of all kinds suffered by that\ngreat and rich continent are sources of serious anxiety.\nHowever, the latest news coming from various\nAfrican subregions allow us to believe that an end to\nconflicts is in sight on the continent. Since the\nbeginning of this year, several meetings of national\nreconciliation have taken place and several peace\nagreements have been signed, including in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, in Angola, in\nBurundi, in Sudan, in Sierra Leone and in Somalia.\nThat offers real hope for African populations. Chad\nintends to fully commit itself to ensure that that hope is\nrealized.\nAlong with other members of the international\ncommunity, the Chadian Government is concerned at\nthe situation that continues to prevail in the Middle\nEast. Unfortunately, that intolerable situation results\nfrom non-compliance with the relevant resolutions of\nthe Security Council and of the General Assembly. In\nthe light of its obligation to be fair to all Members of\nthe Organization, the Council should ban any policy of\ndouble standards and should ensure respect for its\ndecisions, in particular resolutions 242 (1967), 338\n(1973) and 1397 (2002). Genuine peace in the Middle\nEast demands that.\nLikewise, the Government of the Republic of\nChad cannot remain silent on another situation of\ninjustice that continues to preoccupy the Organization:\nits exclusion of the Republic of China on Taiwan. That\nissue comes back to us every year like a boomerang\nbecause we handled it badly more than 30 years ago.\nFor us, as a result, it is a matter of conscience that\nchallenges all of us to find a solution. We have stated\non a number of occasions that it is not a question of\nredressing one injustice by committing another;0 it is\nsimply a question of giving back to the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan, a democratic and responsible\nsovereign State, and to its people the place they should\nhave on the international stage. This is why, once\nagain, the Government of Chad calls for the admission\nof The Republic of China on Taiwan to the\nOrganization.\nAt its creation in 1945 the United Nations had 51\nMembers. Now, almost 200 countries are full Members\nof the Organization. This growth means that it is time\nfor an in-depth reform of its structures to allow for\ngreater participation by all Member States and\nincreased accountability for the taking of international\ndecisions that have a definite impact on the life of all\nour citizens. This is because globalization should not\nbe regarded only as economic, but also as political.\nThus, Chad feels that the restructuring of the\nUnited Nations is essential and should focus on the\nfollowing two points: first, strengthening the role of the\nGeneral Assembly in order to make it more democratic\nand more active in decision-making; and secondly, an\nincrease in the number of the members of the Security\nCouncil in order to achieve better representation for all\nthe geographic areas of the world. Chad therefore\nendorses that position, which is also that of the African\nUnion.\nBefore I conclude my statement I wish to call to\nmind a happy event which took place in my country\njust one year ago. In July 2001 a significant scientific\ndiscovery was made in the Djourab desert in the north\nof Chad, by researchers headed by a French-Chadian\npaleontological mission. This was the discovery of the\nfossilized skull of a hominid known as Sahelanthropus\ntchadensis, dating back approximately 7 million years.\nSahelanthropus tchadensis, which means man of the\nChadian Sahel, has been nicknamed Toumai which\nmeans hope of life in the local language. Study of the\nskull has indicated that this is a new human species, a\nnew earliest member of humankind.\nThis discovery has had a significant impact in the\nscientific community and in world public opinion,\nbecause it challenges the many theories concerning the\norigin of humankind. Toumai is the common ancestor\nof us all, and Chad is now regarded as the cradle of\nhumankind. In order to mark this important discovery,\nthe Chadian Government envisions the establishment\nof a department of paleontology to foster research and\n14\n\neducation in this scientific discipline, as well as the\nconstruction of a museum to develop scientific tourism\nin Chad.\nMy country will be relying on the support of the\ninternational community to carry out these projects in\nthe sphere of scientific research and paleontology in\nparticular. All present are warmly invited to visit Chad,\nnow known as the cradle of humankind, whose tourist\nassets have thus been enhanced by this new scientific\ndiscovery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to begin\nby congratulating the Swiss Confederation on its recent\naccession to the United Nations Organization.\nSwitzerland's immeasurable contribution to the work of\nthe United Nations, even as a non-member, has been\nwidely recognized and appreciated for decades. I am\nconfident that Switzerland, in its new capacity as a\nMember State, will assume an even more significant\nrole in United Nations activities, a role compatible with\nits new status.\nLater this month the United Nations will greet\nanother country, East Timor, as the newest member of\nthe Organization. Like my own country, Latvia, which\nregained its independence only 11 years ago, East\nTimor will face the difficult challenges of\nconsolidating its statehood and enhancing its economic\ndevelopment.\nThe United Nations and the international\ncommunity can be proud that their concerted efforts to\ncreate a climate of peace and security on that island\nhave met with success, and that the people of East\nTimor are now able to be the masters of their own\ndestiny.\nI would also like to express Latvia's continued\nsolidarity and sympathy with the people of the United\nStates, one year and one day after the horrifying\nterrorist attacks that changed the world forever. The\ncourage and resilience displayed by the inhabitants of\nNew York following the destruction of the World Trade\nCenter has been truly remarkable, and the manner in\nwhich New Yorkers have coped with the aftermath of\nthis tragedy has been an inspiration to us all. Today, as\nwell as on the anniversary date itself, Latvians the\nworld over are with the bereaved and with the people\nof the United States in our thoughts and in our prayers.\nWe see the heinous crimes of 11 September not only as\na contemptible act of aggression against the United\nStates, but also as a direct and frontal assault against\nthe civilized world as a whole.\n19\n\nThe foundation of any civilized society rests on\nits deep-seated respect for the sanctity of human life.\nInternational terrorists hold human life in total and\nutter contempt. International terrorists specifically\ntarget civilian non-combatant populations, with the\nexpress goal of extinguishing as many human lives as\npossible. That is precisely what makes international\nterrorists so dangerous and so threatening.\nLatvia, in collaboration with the United Nations,\nthe European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) and all like-minded countries, is\ndetermined to do everything in its power to stem the\ngrowing threat of international terrorism. In the wake\nof the 11 September attacks, the Latvian Government\nhas adopted an action plan that foresees Latvia's\nratification of all international anti-terrorist\nconventions, as well as an increase in the capacity of\nLatvia's administrative, security, law enforcement and\nmilitary structures. We are continuing to harmonize our\nnational legislation according to international and\nEuropean Union standards, and we are tightening our\ncontrol of immigration and the flow of strategic goods.\nWe are improving our air and border surveillance\ncapabilities, updating our emergency response\nprocedures and raising the public's preparedness for\ndealing with emergency situations.\nI would like to express Latvia's concern at the\nfact that one of the Organization's Member States \u2014\nIraq \u2014 continues to ignore repeated calls by both the\nSecurity Council and the rest of the international\ncommunity to allow United Nations weapons\ninspectors on its territory. This lack of good will and\nthis manifest atmosphere of secrecy only serve to\nreinforce credible suspicions that that country is\nclandestinely seeking to produce nuclear, chemical,\nbacteriological and other weapons of mass destruction,\nin clear violation of Security Council resolutions.\nLatvia views such clandestine activities not only as\ndestabilizing to the region, but also as a threat to world\nsecurity. That is why Latvia believes that the United\nNations and the rest of the international community\nmust act deliberately and decisively to curb the\ncontinuing threat of weapons proliferation posed by\nIraq.\nLatvia congratulates the United States of America\non the respect expressed by President George W. Bush\nfor the United Nations as an institutions and on the\ncommitment he expressed this morning to the principle\nof multilaterality that the United Nations embodies. We\napplaud the willingness of the United States to engage\nthe international community, through the United\nNations and through the Security Council, on the\nlegitimate concerns of the United States with regard to\ncontaining and eliminating visible and defiant threats\nto peace and stability in the world.\nLatvia realizes that in this globalized world of the\ntwenty-first century, no nation can be an island unto\nitself. Several other alarming threats besides\ninternational terrorism and arms proliferation present\nsuch serious challenges to the human race that we can\nhope to address them only through concerted and long-\nterm international cooperation. These pressing global\nissues include organized crime and illegal trafficking,\nthe abuse and exploitation of women and children,\nendemic poverty and unemployment, drug addiction\nand disease, and environmental pollution.\nThe global ecological crisis that our planet is now\nexperiencing has resulted from our own reckless\ndisregard for the Earth that sustains us. If we do not\nradically curb the excessive amount of greenhouse\ngases and other pollutants that we produce every day,\nthen we will continue to experience natural disasters\nand climate changes of increasing scope and frequency.\nI am proud to note that Latvia ratified the Kyoto\nProtocol earlier this summer, and I share the hope of\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan that the recent World\nSummit on Sustainable Development, held in\nJohannesburg, will lead to an increased commitment to\nenvironmental protection by the countries Members of\nthe United Nations. Latvia is pleased that target dates\nhave now been set regarding safe drinking water,\nsanitation and permissible levels of harmful chemicals.\nYet we must not allow ourselves to slip into\ncomplacency, as the goals that our countries set at Rio\nin 1992 at the United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development are still far from being\nreached. This past spring, Latvia established a\nsustainable development council, led by the country's\nPrime Minister. That council will establish plans for\nthe sustainable economic, social and environmental\ndevelopment of the country, in conjunction with\nEuropean Union policies.\nTwo years ago, the States Members of the United\nNations adopted another series of far-reaching goals\nwhen they signed the Millennium Declaration on the\nreduction of poverty. Unfortunately, we cannot yet\npride ourselves on having achieved notable progress in\n20\n\nthat sphere. If the laudable goals of the Declaration are\ntruly to be realized in practice, then the States\nMembers of the United Nations will have to display a\nfar greater degree of political will and practical\ncommitment in implementing them.\nThe United Nations itself will need to increase its\nadministrative capacity if it is to effectively cooperate\nwith its Member States in realizing the goals of the\nMillennium Declaration. Thanks to the initiative of\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, several improvements\ncan already be seen in the work of the United Nations,\nparticularly regarding the reform of peacekeeping\noperations and the level of collaboration among the\nOrganization's own institutions.\nFurther improvements could still be made in the\nfinancial discipline of the Organization's Member\nStates through the timely payment of membership dues\nand more rational use by Member States of United\nNations services at United Nations conferences.\nInitiated reforms within the United Nations system\nitself must continue in order to put an end to the\noverlapping of functions and to prevent unnecessary\ncompetition among the Organization's various\ninstitutions. Sounder spending practices and reduced\npaperwork, along with a reduction in the number of\nmeetings and conferences with overlapping themes,\nwould all further increase the effectiveness of United\nNations activities.\nDespite certain deficiencies in the structure and\nwork of the United Nations, the Organization has\ncontributed tremendously to the economic and social\ndevelopment of numerous Member States, including\nmy own country, Latvia. When Latvia regained its\nindependence 11 years ago, it had to undergo a rapid\ntransformation from an occupied nation with a\nrepressive political system to a liberal parliamentary\ndemocracy that respects human rights and liberties, and\nit had to transform its closed and planned State-run\neconomy to an open and free-market economy. Thanks\nto the hard work undertaken by Latvia's people and\ntheir commitment to implement difficult transition\npolicies \u2014 as well as the dedicated support of the\ninternational community \u2014 Latvia now has one of the\nfastest-growing economies in Europe, along with a\nstable national currency and a low rate of inflation.\nWithin a few months, Latvia hopes to receive official\ninvitations to join the European Union and the NATO\nalliance.\nMany of the positive changes that Latvia has\nexperienced over the past decade have been actively\nsupported by the United Nations, and particularly by\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).\nLatvia's new social security system, which is now one\nof the most modern in Europe, was implemented with\ndirect UNDP participation. The UNDP and the Latvian\nGovernment are also cooperating in the implementation\nof minority integration programmes in our country.\nLatvia is still in the process of reforming its health and\neducation systems and, like other countries in Europe,\nmust confront the problem of an ageing population\nresulting from a falling birth rate, the number of deaths\neach year continuing to exceed the number of births.\nNevertheless I am proud to note that on 17 June\nlast Latvia and UNDP signed a memorandum of\nunderstanding by which Latvia's status as a recipient of\nUnited Nations assistance was changed to that of a net\ncontributor. Latvia sees its intellectual potential and its\nexperience in the implementation of transition reforms\nas a national resource. We have now entered the phase\nof sharing this resource with other developing nations.\nDuring the past two years, Latvia, in cooperation with\nCanada and the European Union, has been providing\ntechnical assistance and expertise to Ukraine, Georgia\nand Croatia.\nLatvia is convinced that the reduction of\ndisparities in income and standards of living among the\nworld's nations is essential for the consolidation of\npeace and security across the globe. That is why Latvia\nhas liberalized its trade regime with 49 of the world's\nleast developed countries, in accordance with the Doha\ndevelopment agenda. Within its means and through\nUnited Nations channels, Latvia has also provided\nhumanitarian aid to war-torn areas in the Balkans and\nin Afghanistan.\nEvery nation, no matter how large or how small,\nis possessed of its own intrinsic, inalienable value.\nEvery nation has its unique contribution to make to\nhumanity as a whole. Let us remember this as we meet\nhere today at this fifty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly. Together, our nations have many serious\nchallenges to address. But I am confident that by\nuniting our experiencing and resources, we shall\neventually succeed in reducing poverty, cleaning up\nour environment, controlling the spread of diseases,\nand making this world a safer and more secure place in\nwhich to live.\n21\n\nThe United Nations Organization was created\nfirst and foremost to serve for the benefit of humanity.\nIt was created as an instrument for propagating the\nfundamental principles of democracy, humanism,\nuniversality, mutual respect and understanding.\nAlthough the people and nations of the world are vastly\ndiverse in their conditions of life and in their cultures,\nall human beings share the same basic needs and\ndesires: access to the basic necessities of life, the\npossibility of growing and evolving as individuals, and\nthe change to contribute to the growth and development\nof the countries that we each call home. As fellow\ninhabitants of our beautiful and fragile planet, let us\npledge to commit our efforts to protect the physical\nequilibrium of the earth and to create a fairer social and\neconomic equilibrium across the globe.\n\n\n"

Your election to the\nhelm of the Assembly shows the high esteem in which\nthe international community holds you and your\ncountry, the Czech Republic.\nI take this opportunity to express my delegation's\nsincere appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Han\nSeung-soo of South Korea, for his outstanding\nstewardship of the work of the fifty-sixth session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I also wish to place on record my\nGovernment's deep appreciation to the Secretary-\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for his\ncontinuing strong leadership and immense diplomatic\nskill in dealing with many pressing international issues\nwhich confront us today.\nPapua New Guinea welcomes and congratulates\nthe newest State Member of the United Nations,\nSwitzerland, and looks forward to the accession to\nmembership of the Democratic Republic of East Timor.\nPapua New Guinea acknowledges the political\nwill and wisdom shown by all parties \u2014 the Republic\nof Indonesia, Australia, Portugal and the United\nNations \u2014 in respect of East Timor. We also praise the\npeople of Switzerland for their collective decision to\nformally join the United Nations.\nWith the election of a new Government in my\ncountry, our Prime Minister, The Right Honourable Sir\nMichael Somare, recently made a nationwide address\ndetailing some of the challenges facing our economy\nand what is required to put it back on the path to\nrecovery. He identified specific areas and sectors where\nremedial measures are needed.\nDomestically, our capacity to meet these\nchallenges and worthy goals is lacking. The problem is\nfurther exacerbated and our capacity further\nundermined by poor governance, incompetent\neconomic management, a rise in corruption, and\ndiminished public confidence in political leadership\nand in the fundamentals of representative government.\nThe new Government of Papua New Guinea is\ndetermined to chart a new course by addressing these\nproblems.\nThere have been specific initiatives taken to\nenhance trade, investment and economic prospects. The\nPacific countries members of the African, Caribbean\nand Pacific Island Group of States (ACP), together\nwith the African and Caribbean member States, are\nnow in the process of pursuing negotiations with the\nEuropean Union for possible economic partnership\nagreements.\nRecently, I announced the direction of our\nGovernment's foreign policy focus. I stated that the\n27\n\npolicy must be underpinned by the development and\nstrengthening of core relations in the Asia-Pacific\nregion.\nWe intend to consolidate relations with our close\nneighbours and give more emphasis to the promotion\nof trade and economic cooperation, investment, and\neducation and training.\nAs a small island developing country, and as an\naffected member of the global village, my country fully\nendorses the declarations and plans of action adopted at\nrecent world conferences. We believe that international\nconferences such as the Doha, Monterrey and\nJohannesburg summits and their plans of action are\nblueprints to resolve many of the pressing global\nchallenges and needs, including poverty eradication;\nsustainable development; environmental degradation\nand climatic changes; and social ills, including HIV/\nAIDS and other preventable diseases. They also echo\nthe voices of the majority of the world's population\nliving in poverty and struggling to overcome the\nbiggest challenge of all \u2014 how to survive.\nThese declarations and plans of action are a\nfurther amplification of the historic Millennium\nDeclaration and its Development Goals, signed by all\nour heads of State and Government in September 2000.\nThe challenge is to forge new global partnerships\nfor change \u2014 partnerships in which both developed\nand developing countries join together to address the\nissues that the global community will face in this new\nmillennium. These partnerships also include\ninternational financial institutions, intergovernmental\norganizations, the private sector, non-governmental\norganizations, and civil society.\nThese partnerships will be necessary if the shared\nhopes of humanity for peace and security, sustainable\ndevelopment and a better way of life for all are to be\nrealized.\nPapua New Guinea has been faced with an\ninternal conflict in our province of Bougainville for the\nlast decade. Like all previous Governments, the current\nGovernment will continue to address the continuing\npeaceful resolution of this conflict as a matter of\npriority.\nPapua New Guinea would like to take this\nopportunity to express its appreciation to the United\nNations for its role in resolving this crisis. The conflict\nhas, in fact, involved substantial commitments of\npersonnel and funds by the United Nations,\nneighbouring countries and Governments, including\nour own.\nI would like also to place on record our\nappreciation to the Governments of Australia, New\nZealand, Fiji and Vanuatu for contributing financial\nand manpower resources to the Regional Peace\nMonitoring Group to restore peace and security to the\nisland.\nIn addition, on the recommendations of the\nSecretary-General, and in close cooperation between\nthe Papua New Guinea Government and the\nBougainville parties, the Security Council approved the\nexpansion of the role of the United Nations Political\nOffice in Bougainville in monitoring and assisting in\nthe arms collection, storage and disposal, under the\nnew Bougainville Agreement.\nI am happy to report that the first and second\nstages of the arms disposal programme are progressing\nwell; however, more remains to be done.\nOur partners from Australia, New Zealand, the\nEuropean Union, Japan, and the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme continue to provide resources\nfor restoration and development work. A number of\nnon-governmental organizations, including churches\nand the Red Cross, have also been active.\nChanging the world from a system of relations\nbetween imperial Powers to a partnership between\nsovereign States through decolonization is among the\ngreatest achievements of the United Nations in the last\ncentury. The process will not be completed, as it must\nbe, until the remaining 16 Non-Self-Governing\nTerritories have exercised their inalienable right to self-\ndetermination.\nOur Organization should continue to monitor\ndevelopments in New Caledonia, Tokelau and the other\n14 Non Self-Governing Territories on the United\nNations decolonization list, on a case-by-case basis.\nNeither small size nor remoteness nor population\ndensity should be allowed to qualify or limit the\nexercise of this inalienable right. The Pacific Islands\nForum Leaders' Meeting, held last month in Fiji, once\nagain reaffirmed its support for this principle.\nThe Pacific Islands Forum Group, with the\nexception of Australia and New Zealand, comprises of\nsmall island countries that are custodians of the largest\nocean space. This ocean is rich in natural marine\n28\n\nresources. The countries of the region, however, have\nlimited human, financial and technological capacities\nto control, manage, and secure those resources for the\nbenefit of our current and future generations.\nThe recent Pacific Islands Forum adopted the\nPacific Islands Regional Oceans Policy, which aims to\nensure the future sustainable use of our oceans and\ntheir resources by our island communities and external\npartners.\nThe Pacific Islands peoples have not received\ntheir equitable share of the benefits resulting from the\ntapping of natural resources within their vast ocean\nspace. For example, statistics showed that, in the year\n2000, the value of fishery in the Central and Western\nPacific was in excess of $2.5 billion per annum, but the\nPacific countries earned a meagre $66 million in\nlicensing fees. This situation needs to be reviewed and\nchanged.\nMore than 80 per cent of Papua New Guineans\nlive in rural villages, where they depend directly on the\nland, rivers, lakes and sea for their livelihood.\nOur National Constitution commits the nation to\nconserve, use, and develop the rich variety of the\ncountry's natural resources for the common good and\nbenefit of future generations. Papua New Guinea has\ntherefore spoken out strongly and worked actively on a\nwide range of environmental issues.\nLike other members of the Pacific Islands Forum,\nPapua New Guinea is firmly committed to the\nBarbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. We\nstrongly urge its full implementation.\nPapua New Guinea, together with other small\nisland developing States, continues to reiterate deep\nconcerns about the adverse impacts of climate change,\nclimate variability and sea-level rise, particularly with\nregard to the small, low-lying islands that are already\nexperiencing extreme hardships. We will therefore\ncontinue to stress the urgent need for the developed\ncountries to take a strong lead in the reductions of\ngreenhouse gas emissions.\nConsistent with this, Papua New Guinea has\nsigned and ratified both the United Nations Climate\nChange Convention and the Kyoto Protocol. We\nbelieve that the Kyoto Protocol paves the way forward\nfor Annex I countries to fulfil their commitments under\nthe Climate Change Convention. We urge those parties\nto translate their legally binding targets into concrete\nactions for the reduction of their gas emissions.\nWe welcome the support for the Kyoto Protocol\nby Japan, the European Union and, more recently,\nChina and Russia. We urge the United States and\nAustralia to join the global efforts towards addressing\nthis issue, including ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.\nPacific Forum island leaders also reiterated\ncontinuing serious concerns over the shipment of\nradioactive materials through the region. They called\non those States engaging in these activities to accept\nfull responsibility and liability for compensation for\nany damage that may result, directly or indirectly, from\nthe transport of radioactive material through the region.\nGlobal warming has brought an increase in the\nnumber of cases of diseases like malaria in the higher-\naltitude regions of our country. This is still a major\nthreat to Papua New Guinea, particularly in the most\npopulous region \u2014 the highlands.\nPapua New Guinea is not immune to the HIV/\nAIDS epidemic, and tuberculosis is again on the rise,\nso there is an urgent need to find preventative measures\nfor these diseases.\nIn this regard, we welcome announcements by the\nGovernments of Japan and the United States, among\nother, that they would set aside substantial financial\nresources for eradication programmes in developing\ncountries. Papua New Guinea concurs with the recent\ncalls by the international community to reform and\nrestructure the charters and mandates of the two\nBretton Woods institutions: the World Bank and the\nInternational Monetary Fund. These two institutions\nmust realign their policies and focus more on\ndevelopment and poverty eradication, rather than on\nthe reconstruction of economies.\nTheir lending policies should be made more\nlenient and flexible in assisting the developing\ncountries, including small islands, landlocked and the\nleast developed countries. The ultimate goal must be to\ntransfer resources into the hands of the needy, the\nmarginalized and the ostracized of society, so that they\ncan take pride in the ownership of the outcomes of new\ninitiatives taken in their own countries.\nThe way forward was agreed to under the\nBarbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island States and Agenda 21\nand in the recent conferences on landlocked developing\n29\n\ncountries and the Third United Nations Conference on\nthe Least Developed Countries in Brussels.\nI must however underline that to date, we have\nobserved a lack of effective implementation of both the\nBarbados Programme of Action and Agenda 21. There\nhas also been little or no increase in the international\naid and development assistance given to the developing\ncountries to build necessary infrastructure, human\nresource capacities, and other basic needs. This, in our\nhumble view, has to change if the developing countries,\nespecially the small island developing States,\nlandlocked and the least developed countries are to\nattain sustainable growth and development.\nThere is an urgent need to reform and restructure\nthe United Nations General Assembly and its\nsubsidiary bodies and agencies, as well as the Security\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council, so as to\nreflect the recent dynamics and changes.\nThe Security Council should be reformed and\nexpanded in both categories, permanent and non-\npermanent. It must take into account the interests of\nboth the developed and developing countries.\nAlthough we are encouraged by the general\npositive signs of progress towards resolving conflicts\nand securing peace in several regions of the world,\nPapua New Guinea remains concerned at the\ncontinuing conflict in the Middle East. We believe\nviolence will not resolve the conflict. We call on both\nIsrael and the Palestinian leadership to come to the\nnegotiating table to discuss outstanding issues with the\nview to resolving the conflict peacefully.\nIt would be remiss of me if I did not make\nmention of the fact that 11 September 2002 marked the\nfirst anniversary of the terrorist attacks in the United\nStates of America. The Government and people of\nPapua New Guinea express to the Government and\npeople of the United States, and the families of the\nvictims drawn from many countries, our sympathy for\nthe tragedy and suffering of just a year ago, when\nterrorism struck this great city of New York and\nWashington, D.C., and Pennsylvania.\nThough distant from this tragic event, we share in\nthe deep sorrow felt around the world, and in the\nadmiration of the extraordinary bravery and sacrifice of\nso many who engaged themselves in the rescue efforts.\nOur thoughts are with those who continue to mourn.\nPapua New Guinea joins with all the freedom\nloving nations and peoples of the world in condemning\nterrorism in all its evil forms. Terrorist attacks can\nnever be justified. Terrorism, in which the lives of the\nmost innocent and vulnerable are so senselessly taken,\nmust be especially condemned.\nPapua New Guinea fully endorses and supports\nall efforts towards the effective implementation of the\nUnited Nations Security Council resolution 1373\n(2001).\nYou concluded your opening address to this\nAssembly, Mr. President, by appealing to Member\nStates to focus on what we have in common \u2014 and\nespecially our desire to live in a peaceful and secure\nworld where the values and principles expressed in the\nUnited Nations Charter are honoured. Papua New\nGuinea shares your vision and the confidence that\nunderpin your address.\nIf the nations of the world \u2014 with our great\ndiversity \u2014 focus on what we have in common, we\nwill build and secure a better world, one in which the\nbenefits of economic development are shared, and one\nin which the marvels of modern science and\ntechnology, including modern medicine, are harnessed\nfor the common good of humanity. But none of these\nthings can be achieved without a genuine and lasting\npeace.\nIn conclusion, I want to reaffirm Papua New\nGuinea's firm commitments to what I have outlined\nand reiterate that global, regional and local\npartnerships in promoting sustainable development is\nthe key to addressing the challenges that confront the\nworld today.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like first of all to congratulate\nMr. Kavan on his election to the presidency.\nOn 21 March at Monterrey, Mexico, the President\nof Nicaragua, Enrique Bola\u00f1os Geyer, announced that\n\u201ca process of moral renewal has been launched in\nNicaragua, with a crusade against public and private\ncorruption\u201d.\nOn that same day, the President also announced\nthat, in the spirit of the new era of moral renewal,\n\u201ca Nicaraguan judge has just found three former\nofficials of the previous Government and three\nother people guilty of acts of corruption that\nimpoverished our people. The judge left pending\nthe case against former President Alem\u00e1n and\neight other officials of the previous Government\u201d.\nPresident Bola\u00f1os went on to say:\n\u201cWith a view to continuing my policy of zero\ntolerance of corruption, I must return to my\ncountry as soon as possible to contribute, with\njustice and transparency, to the historic landmark\nconstituted by this bold decision.\u201d\nA few days ago, in a similar case, another\ncourageous Nicaraguan judge sentenced members of\nthe former President's immediate family to jail.\nToday, I have come before this General Assembly\non behalf of an entire people to reaffirm, in deed,\nNicaragua's commitment to governance, transparency,\naccountability and to the principles of the rule of law.\n27\n\nThere is much at stake today in Nicaragua. Not\nonly must we punish corrupt officials and recover for\nour country Government money that was diverted and\nlaundered, but also the results of our efforts will be\ncrucial to the struggle waged by other peoples of our\nregion and of the world against this scourge.\nNicaragua's success will be an incentive for the entire\ninternational community. The failure of transparency in\nNicaragua would set a bad precedent for humankind.\nWe have not fought this battle alone. The support\nof more than 84 per cent of our population has been\ncoupled with the moral and economic support of many\ncountries, embodying the democratic values shared by\nus, the peoples of the United Nations. To them, to the\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and\nto the international organizations that have supported\nus, we extend our sincere gratitude.\nIn order to ensure that the changes we have made\nare irreversible, we will need sustained and adequate\nsupport. In this way, we will preserve the great moral\nheritage of humankind \u2014 democracy exercised with\nhonesty and accountability.\nAs a part of this great heritage, we are today\ndiscussing human development, conceived as the\nState's ultimate purpose, to be attained through\ndemocratic governance, economic growth and social\nequity. We understand governance to be the result of\ndoing things correctly in the political sphere \u2014\ntransparency, human rights and sovereignty. We see\ngrowth as the result of doing the right things in the\neconomic and financial spheres, foreign exchange,\nfiscal and monetary policies and competition. And we\nunderstand equity as the result of doing things right in\nthe social sphere \u2014 namely, in education, health,\nhousing and gender equality.\nProgress in bringing together these three elements\nthat comprise human development will not be possible\nuntil corruption is rooted out. By its very nature, the\nscourge of corruption has an impact that transcends\nnational borders. In this regard, we offer our full\nsupport to the work being carried out by the special\ncommittee responsible for negotiating a United Nations\nconvention against corruption. From this forum, we\nappeal to the international community to commit itself\nto the broadest possible mutual assistance and\ncooperation in investigating or prosecuting acts of\ncorruption.\nTerrorism is just as abhorrent as corruption. This\nmonth we remember with anguish the tragedy of 11\nSeptember, when thousands of innocent people\nperished, many of them heroically. This tragedy, like\nall terrorist acts, must never be forgotten. At the same\ntime, international cooperation to deal with such crimes\nmust remain permanently on our agenda. It is essential\nthat we coordinate activities to prevent and punish such\nterrorist activities, which cause so much pain and\nsuffering, with the full force of the law.\nNicaragua wishes to reaffirm once again its\nunconditional support for United Nations activities to\ncombat international terrorism in all its forms and\nmanifestations. In Nicaragua, we have already set in\nplace a National Plan against Terrorism and Related\nCrimes, designed to strengthen cooperation among\ninstitutions, and with the aim of preventing, combating\nand eliminating this scourge, and complying with\nSecurity Council resolutions.\nThe case of Iraq is a challenge and a test for the\nentire multilateral system that we have been\nconstructing. It is up to us to either help strengthen it\nor help to weaken and fracture it. While it is true that\nwe are all in favour of multilateral action, it is also\nundeniable that inertia and inaction undermine\nconfidence in our collective will. The multilateral\nsystem must demonstrate the dynamism which is its\nvery raison d'\u00eatre by taking joint, concerted and timely\naction to resolve conflicts.\nWe wish to see a system capable of reacting with\nspecific, timely and effective measures to dangers that\nthreaten international peace and security, a system that\ndoes not find itself overtaken by circumstances.\nNicaragua takes the view that the immediate and\nunconditional return of United Nations weapons\ninspectors to Iraq, in a climate of complete\ncooperation, can only be regarded as an important part\nof a greater effort aimed at the elimination of all kinds\nof weapons of mass destruction, within the context of\nthe global interests of the international community and\nin compliance with all pertinent Security Council\nresolutions.\nThe reform of the United Nations is also part of\nthe desire to respond effectively. Reform basically\nrevolves around new organizational and administrative\nstructures, which, without a doubt, have gradually\nenabled the United Nations to act with greater unity of\npurpose, coherence and flexibility. Nicaragua, like the\n28\n\nSecretary-General, believes that there is still great\npotential for progress, and we must all ensure that the\nOrganization's work programme includes the priorities\nset out in the Millennium Declaration.\nNo reform of the United Nations would be\ncomplete without the long-awaited expansion of the\nSecurity Council in order to enable it to respond fully\nand effectively to current and future needs. Similarly,\nwe must pursue efforts to revitalize the General\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council in\norder to empower the Organization fully to assume its\nresponsibilities, as enshrined in the Charter. Nicaragua\nshares the interest of Member States in strengthening\nthe Organization, with a view to optimizing its efforts\nto maintain international peace and security, prevent\nconflicts, promote sustainable development and\neradicate poverty.\nThe recent World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment filled us with hope and, at the same time,\nuneasiness. On the one hand, we saw the degree of\nattention being focused on the problem of\nenvironmental degradation. But, on the other hand, the\npath to achieving the balance between development\nand environment is still long and arduous, particularly\nfor the least developed countries. Before us lies the\nchallenge of generating greater wealth and more jobs\nwithout harming our environment. We cannot achieve\nthis without the support of the developed countries,\nwhich must help pay the price of the benefits they reap\nfrom our efforts. Therefore, I wish to recall the\nMonterrey consensus, where we urged those developed\ncountries that have not yet done so to adopt specific\nmeasures to allocate 0.7 per cent of their gross\ndomestic product for official development assistance\n(ODA) to the developing countries.\nNicaragua is aware that violence, civil and\ninternational wars, the scourge of acquired\nimmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), drought and\npoverty are the main problems afflicting the African\ncontinent in recent years. However, we note with\nconcern that international cooperation and assistance to\nAfrica are diminishing. The efforts of African\nGovernments to achieve economic growth and alleviate\npoverty must be matched.\nDevelopment efforts have also been given direct\nexpression in Central America, where we have reached\nimportant agreements and taken decisions that today\nenable us to say that our region is embarking on a new\nera in its history. On 21 June last, in the city of\nGranada, Nicaragua, we held the Twenty-First\nOrdinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government\nof Central America. This provided the opportunity to\nreaffirm our commitment to moving towards the\nconsolidation of a Central American Customs Union,\nwhich will become a reality on 31 December 2003. The\nCustoms Union was conceived as a means of\ncontributing to the economic and social development of\nour countries. It will promote smooth interregional\ntrade, reduce the costs of transport owing to border\ndelays, facilitate the movement of persons and\nvehicles, and, at the same time, attract international\nbusiness and investment to the region.\nNonetheless, the prolonged halt in the\ninternational economic recovery was exacerbated in\nNicaragua by uncharacteristic problems in the external\nsector, owing to the high price of imported oil and the\nlowest coffee prices in history.\nAccording to data provided by Gabriel Silva,\nPresident of the Colombian Coffee Growers'\nFederation, five years ago, coffee consumers paid 30\nbillion dollars while producers received 12 billion\ndollars, or 40 per cent. Today, consumers pay 65 billion\ndollars but producers receive only 5.5 billion dollars or\nless than 8.5 per cent.\nThis critical situation, which is generating\nunemployment and hunger in the productive areas of\nNicaragua and other producer countries, seems to be\ncaused by a cartel of coffee-roasters, a situation that\nmust be remedied as soon as possible through measures\nto promote competition in consumer markets and on\nthe international market.\nNicaragua congratulates Switzerland on recently\njoining the United Nations as a new Member and\nTimor-Leste, which is about to join. Their presence\namong us will contribute new ideas and approaches to\nstrengthening efforts for a better world, and \u2014\nparaphrasing the representative of Switzerland's\nstatement to this General Assembly \u2014 will enhance the\nuniversality of the United Nations in the best interest of\nhumankind.\nIn this same connection, my country, aware of the\nprinciple of universality and equality that inspired the\nUnited Nations, considers it a priority to permit the 23\nmillion inhabitants of the Republic of China on Taiwan\nto enjoy the universal right to participate in\ninternational affairs through its own delegation to the\n29\n\nUnited Nations, parallel to and with the same rights of\nparticipation as the People's Republic of China, whose\nGovernment has never exercised hegemony over\nTaiwan.\nNicaragua, as a founding State of this\nOrganization, reaffirms its commitment to the Charter\nand its aspiration to become a non-permanent member\nof the Security Council during the elections to be held\nduring the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.\nI spoke earlier of a new era of moral renewal in\nNicaragua rooted in the values of the United Nations. I\nbelieve that when we speak of strengthening\ndemocracy, reforming the Organization, fighting\ncorruption, terrorism and drug trafficking, halting the\narms race or providing joint, timely and effective\nresponses to the dangers which threaten us, we are\nreally speaking of one and the same thing: belonging\njointly to an Organization that holds and safeguards our\ntrust and collective action based on the principles that\nunited our peoples on that historic day to create the\nUnited Nations.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me begin, Mr.\nPresident, by congratulating you on your well-deserved\nelection. It is a great pleasure to see you, my good\nfriend and colleague, preside over the proceedings of\nthe General Assembly at this session. My delegation is\nready to provide its full support to you. Let me also\nexpress my gratitude to your predecessor, His\nExcellency Mr. Han Seung-soo, for his dedication and\naccomplishment.\nSlovakia welcomes Switzerland as the newest\nMember of our Organization. We look forward also to\nwelcoming East Timor and to working closely with\nboth of them in promoting peace, security and\nprosperity throughout the world.\nThe terrorist attacks on the United States a year\nago evoked worldwide anguish and outrage, followed\nby enormous solidarity among nations throughout the\nworld and a firm stand by the worldwide coalition\nagainst the scourge of terror. At the end of the day,\nthose cowardly acts of terror did not reach their\nultimate goal: chaos, anarchy and the destruction of the\n12\n\nworld community. On the contrary, they strengthened\nour resolution to seek world peace and security and to\npromote life in dignity and prosperity for all. Slovakia\npledged its full support for the anti-terrorist coalition\nfrom the very beginning.\nAs the ruins of the World Trade Center were\nsmouldering at the southern tip of Manhattan, the\nGeneral Assembly, the Security Council and the\nSecretary-General acted quickly, resolutely and\ncollectively. The United Nations proved to be crucial in\nthe fight against terrorism, which should be maintained\nas a global campaign. Organizing this global task must\nbe central to our efforts at the United Nations. We\nacknowledge the role of the United Nations in trying to\nraise the capacity of every Member to defeat terrorism\nin a globally coordinated way and in conformity with\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001), which was\nadopted unanimously by the Council last year.\nSince 11 September 2001, the Slovak authorities\nhave adapted and strengthened domestic legislation so\nthat it can be applied effectively against acts of\nterrorism. Slovakia deposited its instrument of\nratification to the International Convention for the\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism earlier this\nmonth, and has thus become party to all 12\ninternational conventions and protocols against\nterrorism. Their provisions are already incorporated in\nour domestic legislation. We are committed to continue\nour cooperation in these endeavours with the relevant\nUnited Nations institutions.\nShortly following 11 September 2001, the Al\nQaeda network and the Taliban regime that harboured\nthose terrorists were fought and disrupted. Organizing\na global response to the political and humanitarian\ncrises in Afghanistan became one of the crucial tasks at\nthe Untied Nations. A chance for the people of\nAfghanistan to start rebuilding their country, which had\nbeen fragmented for so long, has been offered. We\ncommend the work of the United Nations Assistance\nMission in Afghanistan and the countries contributing\nto the International Security Assistance Force. Slovakia\nis actively engaged in the reconstruction and\nrehabilitation process in Afghanistan. An engineering\nunit from Slovakia was dispatched to take part in the\nOperation Enduring Freedom in August 2002.\nSlovakia reaffirms its commitment to arms\ncontrol, disarmament and the non-proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction. We effectively participate\nin regional and global efforts in the field of\ndisarmament and international security. The increased\nthreat of international terrorism today gives rise to\nquestions regarding the relationship between terrorism\nand disarmament, as well as the contributions that\nmultilateral treaties and institutions in this field can\nmake. We must make greater progress in achieving\ndisarmament and non-proliferation goals, strengthen\nverification and implementation mechanisms, and\nthereby contribute to the creation of a safer world in\nwhich terrorism cannot breed and flourish. We will\ncontinue to work cooperatively and constructively in\nthe pursuit of disarmament and arms limitation goals.\nOver the last decade we have witnessed an\nupsurge in ethnic, social and religious violence all over\nthe world, when simmering tensions and power\nstruggles boiled over into open conflicts. There has\nbeen an increasing demand for the United Nations to\nintervene with regard to those threats to international\npeace and security. As a result, peacekeeping has\nbecome more frequent and more complex. Modern\npeacekeeping operations are multidimensional, with\ntasks ranging from traditional deployment of military\npersonnel, demining and medical support, to verification,\ndisarmament, the rebuilding of infrastructure and the\nfacilitation of institution-building, democratization and\nelections. Peacekeeping operations have changed also in\nterms of the financial resources they require.\nMy Government has always been fully committed\nto the maintenance of international peace and security.\nPeacekeeping has always been an important aspect of\nour involvement in United Nations activities. Slovakia\ncurrently provides military personnel and observers for\nseven United Nations peacekeeping missions, in Ethiopia\nand Eritrea, in Cyprus, in Iraq, in Jerusalem, on the Golan\nHeights, in Sierra Leone and in East Timor. The number\nof Slovak military personnel serving under the United\nNations flag has steadily increased since the mid-1990s.\nCurrently, there are more than 600 troops, apart from the\nSlovak soldiers participating in missions in the Balkans\nunder NATO leadership. Slovakia will remain actively\nengaged in this crucial area of the United Nations\nresponsibilities in the future.\nLet me pay tribute to those courageous men and\nwomen from various nations who contributed to the peace\nmissions and who lost their lives while serving under the\nUnited Nations flag. My country has also suffered the\nloss of lives. Four brave Slovak men have been\nawarded, in memoriam, the Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld medal.\n13\n\nResolutions adopted by the Security Council\nunder Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter are\nlegally binding. The failure of any Member State to\nfulfil the requirements of those resolutions constitutes a\nbreach of the Charter. In such cases, the international\ncommunity has the right to enforce the rule of law. We\nhave carefully noted the decision of the Government of\nIraq, announced earlier this week, to allow the return of\nUnited Nations weapons inspectors without conditions.\nYet that decision needs to be matched with further\nconcrete steps which would provide for the swift and\nfull implementation of the relevant Security Council\nresolutions.\nThe question of Israel and Palestine has been\noccupying our attention since the United Nations was\nfounded. It is our common responsibility to achieve a\ncomprehensive solution resulting in the existence of two\nStates living side by side in peace and mutual respect\nwithin secure and recognized borders. We fully support\nthe efforts of the diplomatic Quartet on the Middle East\nto push forward the vision of peace in the region.\nSlovakia is fully committed to the rules and\nprinciples of international law and justice. In that context,\nwe attach particular importance to the work of the\nInternational Court of Justice. The Court has proved to be\na very useful institution for resolving inter-State disputes,\nincluding some serious territorial disputes. That\ninstitution deserves full support, including financial\nsupport, from the General Assembly. Slovakia and its\nsouthern neighbour have previously submitted a\ndispute to the Court. Now, having already recognized\nthe Court's jurisdiction over a number of European\ncountries, we are in the process of preparing a\ndeclaration that will recognize the general compulsory\njurisdiction of the Court, in accordance with article 36,\nparagraph 2, of the Statute.\nWe remain convinced that, as the main repository\nof international law, the United Nations must play an\nimportant role in strengthening legal approaches to\nfighting the most serious crimes of international concern.\nSlovakia fully supports the work of international criminal\ntribunals, as well as the establishment of the International\nCriminal Court. We have signed and ratified the Rome\nStatute of the Court. Slovakia became one of the countries\nwhose ratification was necessary for the entry into force\nof the Statute on 1 July 2002. Despite various concerns\nand reservations expressed by some Member States of\nthe United Nations, we continue to believe that the\nCourt has the potential to promote the rule of law and\nto prevent impunity by persons who commit the most\nserious of crimes.\nOur position on the issue of Security Council\nreform is linked to the importance we attach to making\nthe Organization more effective. Let me once again\nunderline this position. In addition to maintaining its\nnecessary representative character, the Security\nCouncil should also preserve the required operational\nflexibility. Slovakia supports the enlargement of the\nSecurity Council in both the non-permanent as well as\nthe permanent category. We consider it fully justified\nfor one additional non-permanent seat to be allocated\nto the Group of Eastern European States, as that\nGroup's membership has doubled in the last decade.\nAs the world becomes more and more global, the\nUnited Nations should respond by becoming ever more\nuniversal. The concerns of all nations should be\nlistened to irrespective of their size, geographic\nlocation, military strength or economic power. We have\nno doubts as to the irreplaceable role of the United\nNations in tackling global issues, whether with regard\nto the protection of human rights, the eradication of\nfamine, poverty, disease and illiteracy or prevention of\nthe proliferation of drugs and weapons.\nWe all live on one planet. We must all face the\ndeterioration of the environment and together adopt\nadequate measures to guarantee sustainable development.\nThe Millennium Declaration shows us the right way. The\nworld community must now increase its efforts to meet\nall of these goals. The Monterrey and Johannesburg\nsummits proved that much can be achieved if decisions\nare based on global consensus. They also showed the\npower of having the will and determination to tackle\nglobal issues. We now have to concentrate on the\nfulfilment of our commitments. We need deeds. The\nUnited Nations should play a leading role in\nmonitoring the implementation of our decisions. We\nneed a United Nations that is strong and efficient.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffPlease accept, Mr. President,\nthe warm congratulations of the Republic of the Fiji\nIslands on your election to lead this forum. I also\nextend my appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Han\nSeung-soo of the Republic of Korea, for his guidance\nof the General Assembly during the past year. We also\nwish to congratulate Switzerland on its admission to\nthe Organization, as well as East Timor on its imminent\nmembership of the United Nations. Their membership\ngives them a direct share in the collective\nresponsibility of the United Nations to promote world\npeace, security and development.\nWhen I last spoke here, in September 2000, my\ncountry was in the throes of its most dangerous crisis,\nfollowing an armed uprising against the elected\nGovernment. However, with God's help and with the\nsupport of our own citizens and the understanding of\nfriends overseas, we have passed through the worst. We\nreturned to parliamentary democracy through general\nelections in August last year. We have been welcomed\nback into the Commonwealth and granted leadership of\nthe African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States\n(ACP). Recently, we hosted the third summit of ACP\nleaders, as well as the thirty-third meeting of the\nPacific Islands Forum. Our economy is growing again,\nand we have just concluded a successful national\nconsultation on strategies for development. We have\nalso embarked on a reconciliation effort to strengthen\npeace and harmony in our multiracial society.\nToday I thank the Member States of the United\nNations and the United Nations system for their\nsupport and understanding during our period of crisis.\nThey stood with us, with words of quiet\nencouragement, and expressed confidence in our ability\nto resolve our own difficulties. There were others who\nwere judgmental and strident. Their approach was not\nhelpful. We remind them of the founding principles of\nthe United Nations: respect for national sovereignty\nand non-interference in the internal affairs of Member\nStates. Countries have the right to seek, and to put into\neffect, their own solutions to their problems.\nNot far from this site is the desolate and empty\nspace of Ground Zero. It is a scar not only on the face\nof this city; it is a scar on the world, a terrible reminder\nof an unspeakable act of horror. We in the Pacific share\nAmerica's pain. We cannot feel it in all its intensity,\nbut we have a sense of the anguish and the anger. Our\nthoughts and prayers have been with the American\n2\n\npeople. We remember the innocents of so many races\nand faiths whose blood was spilled by hate, including\nthose killed in Kenya, Tanzania and other places, through\nwanton acts of terrorism. Let it be known that the small\nnations of the Pacific join the United Nations and all\nright-thinking countries in the fight against terrorism.\nIn the Pacific Ocean, we are far from the world's\ncentres of power and areas of conflict and tension, but\nwe are very conscious that, today, no country is beyond\nthe reach of fanatics all too ready to kill and maim at\nrandom. The Pacific's response to the heightened\nthreats of terrorism and transnational crime is\ncontained in the Nasonini Declaration on regional\nsecurity. This was adopted at the recent meeting of the\nPacific Islands Forum, which I had the honour to chair.\nThe Declaration binds the Pacific Islands Forum States\nto the implementation of internationally agreed anti-\nterrorism measures, such as Security Council resolution\n1373 (2001) and the special recommendations of the\nFinancial Action Task Force. Forum countries have\nundertaken to introduce legislation and other measures\nto combat terrorism and terrorist financing. We will\nsimilarly act against drug trafficking, people smuggling\nand money laundering, in accordance with work\nundertaken by such organizations as the United Nations.\nThe summit of the African, Caribbean and Pacific\nGroup of States (ACP) in Fiji in July lent the weight of\n78 States, with 650 million people, to the anti-terrorism\ncampaign. Its Nadi Declaration strongly condemned\nthe 11 September attacks and terrorism in all its forms.\nACP countries want terror to be fought politically,\nlegally and operationally and in keeping with the\nUnited Nations Charter. We made the point that the\nroot causes of terrorism, including poverty,\nunderdevelopment and oppression, must be treated.\nThe member countries of the Pacific Islands Forum\nare heartened that at last there is an awakening to the\nimportance of the oceans. The international community is\nstarting to see that the conservation and sustainable use of\nthe oceans are vital to the survival of the human race and\nthis planet. It was a significant achievement for us that the\nPlan of Implementation adopted at the World Summit on\nSustainable Development had a comprehensive section\non oceans and numerous allied issues. The Summit\nspecifically recognized that oceans, islands and coastal\nareas are essential to the Earth's ecosystem and critical\nto food security and the economic welfare of many\ndeveloping countries.\nWhile the island States are small in population\nand area \u2014 in contrast to the billions who occupy the\nlarge land continents \u2014 we have something no other\ninternational grouping possesses. Our Pacific heritage\ngives us sovereign authority over nearly one sixth of the\nEarth's surface. The Pacific has been described as the last\nfrontier, its depths still largely unexplored, its total\nresources unknown. This almost boundless body of water\ncontains great biological diversity, the most extensive\ncoral reefs in the world, seabed minerals and the largest\nsustainable tuna fishery. Humankind still does not\nknow what forms of natural energy it may produce.\nIt is our responsibility, as people of the islands, to\nprotect and nurture the Pacific. We must do so not only\nfor ourselves, but for people everywhere. For the first\ntime, we have adopted a regional ocean policy which\nlays out the guiding principles for promoting the\nPacific as a maritime environment in support of\nsustainable development. These principles are based on\ninternational law, reflected in the United Nations\nConvention on the Law of the Sea and other\ninternational and regional agreements. The policy's\nobjective is to improve our understanding of the Ocean,\nmaintain its health and ensure environmentally sound\nuse of its resources and riches. It also recognizes that\nwe cannot take on this task alone and that we will\ntherefore need to develop partnerships and promote\nPacific cooperation.\nFor Pacific islands peoples, the ocean\nenvironment is an integral part of their ethnic and\ncultural identity and way of life. It is because of the\nimportance of the sea and its resources to them that they\nare so adamantly opposed to any action which exposes the\nPacific Ocean to pollution, hazardous waste and the\ndestructive effects of nuclear and missile tests.\nRecently, radioactive materials have been trans-\nshipped across the Pacific in arrogant defiance of our\nprotests. We are told there is no risk, but when we\npropose payment of compensation if there should be an\naccident, there is instant rejection. The danger these\nshipments pose to us is underscored by the disaster off the\ncoast of South Africa, where a freighter ran aground with\na hold full of toxic chemicals. We read of a ship\ncarrying hazardous cargo on fire in waters off Britain.\nWe do not want the Pacific put at risk in this way.\nWe know too well the legacy of radioactivity from\nnuclear-weapons testing. People in parts of the Pacific\ncontinue to suffer from the fallout. We are still waiting\n3\n\nfor those who committed these acts to take full\nresponsibility for what they have done.\nThere are real hazards to low-lying atolls from\nanother by-product of this era of environmental crisis.\nRising sea levels caused by global warming will lead to\nthe disappearance of some islands. They will sink\nbeneath the waves. Do not therefore be surprised if in\nfuture environmental refugees from Oceania are forced\nto seek sanctuary elsewhere.\nThe world should also not be surprised at the\nstrong call from the Pacific for the adoption and\nratification of the Kyoto Protocol. We praise those\nnations that have signified their intention to ratify. To\nthose who have not done so, we pose the same question\nwe asked in Johannesburg: Will you display the\ncourage, generosity and largeness of spirit the world\nneeds from you? Will you join fully in saving the Earth\nfrom the gross abuse and destruction of its resources?\nWe have done much in the Pacific to secure our\nownership of the rich regional tuna fishery. Ten years\nof combined effort, negotiation, lobbying and\npainstaking legal drafting led to the adoption of the\nUnited Nations Law of the Sea Convention in 1982.\nWhen it came into force, international law allowed us\nto lay claim to huge areas of marine-resource\njurisdiction through archipelagic regimes and 200-\nnautical-mile exclusive economic zones. We established\nthe Forum Fisheries Agency to coordinate our efforts to\nget the best returns from valuable tuna stocks. There was\na successful conclusion to negotiations with America for\na regional fisheries agreement. I pay tribute here to the\nUnited States for its willingness to reach an accord and\nfor agreeing to its extension to 2013.\nWe still have much to do, however, to consolidate\nour position and to ensure that we bring an end to\nexploitation, which continues unabated. We are\nangered by the indiscriminate commercial exploitation\nof our tuna by distant-water fishing fleets. They have\nno compunction about using purse seine methods and\ndrift nets, which take huge amounts of small tuna and\ndestroy other species. We call on those nations to act\nresponsibly and to stop this ruthless exploitation. The\nreality is that more than 95 per cent of the annual value\nof the South Pacific catch is taken by them. Where\narrangements for fees to be paid do apply, the return to the\nregion is less than 3 per cent of the annual commercial\nworth of the harvest. Obviously, we must redouble our\nefforts to improve our ability to receive a fair share of\nthese resources from harvesting and processing.\nThe next step is to bring into effect the Western\nand Central Pacific Tuna Convention. This will\nestablish a commission to secure long-term\nsustainability. The Convention recognizes that the\nstandards of other regions cannot be applied to us and\nthat our interests will be safeguarded against more\npowerful and economically superior Powers.\nWe very much welcomed the undertaking by a\nnumber of countries in Johannesburg to permit quota\nand tariff-free market access to the least developed of\nthe developing countries. We urge them to extend the\nsame access conditions to developing island States. We\nknow that free trade, as espoused by the World Trade\nOrganization, is the ideal. All nations will trade on the\nsame basis of equality and fairness, but what a large\ngap there is between the ideal and the reality. The\ndeveloping countries hear huge amounts of free-market\nrhetoric from the rich nations, but it is completely\ncancelled out by the reality of continuing\nprotectionism. There is no level playing field for the\npoorer nations, only a steep and slippery slope. That is\nwhy we must move carefully into an integrated system\nof world trade and allow special treatment for those\ndeveloping countries that are especially vulnerable.\nIt is in furtherance of this that I make a plea for\nthe acceptance of small island developing States as a\nspecial case for trade and aid assistance. This would\nbring them into line with the least developed and\nlandlocked developing countries.\nNext week will see the commencement of formal\nnegotiations between the European Union and the\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries on new\npartnership arrangements under the Cotonou\nAgreement. The ACP States look forward to\nstrengthening the partnership with the European Union\nstarted under the Lom\u00e9 Convention in 1975. It is also\ntheir hope that the new economic partnership\nagreements will incorporate commitments made by the\nEuropean Union member countries at Johannesburg.\nThe United Nations was conceived to seek the\nbetterment of people and to foster security and peace in\nthe world. It has had its failures, and it still has its\ncritics. But let us not forget the successes and its\ninfluence for good. Consider where we would be\nwithout the United Nations. We believe it has a\n4\n\ncontinuing role and a future, given the commitment of\nthe membership to its governing principles.\nI am pleased to assure the Assembly that the\nPacific Island Forum and the Africa, Caribbean and\nPacific Group strongly support our Secretary-General's\nnew emphasis on preventive diplomacy. Conflict\nprevention and peace-building should continue to be\nthe central considerations in involvement by the United\nNations in ongoing efforts to deal with conflict and\ncrisis situations in the Middle East and elsewhere.\nWe congratulate the United Nations on the\nsuccess of its various peacekeeping operations. Fiji's\nparticipation in the United Nations Interim Force in\nLebanon (UNIFIL), after more than 24 years, will\nconclude in December this year. It has been a great\nhonour for us to serve the international cause of bringing\npeace and order to that part of the Middle East.\nFiji reaffirms its willingness to continue its\nparticipation in United Nations and international\npeacekeeping operations. All this has cost us dearly in\nlost lives, but it is a price we are willing to pay for\ninternational peace and security.\nWe live in uncertain times. The world is troubled.\nWe look to the United Nations to provide steadiness\nand balance at the centre. We look to it to maintain\npeace on earth and hope for humanity. Member\ncountries of the Pacific Island Forum have committed\nthemselves to promoting and safeguarding the Pacific\nOcean as a region of peace. We appeal to all those who\nare part of our wider Pacific community to embrace the\nway of peace and to constructively engage in\ncooperation for development. We welcome China's\nincreasing presence and involvement in supporting and\nassisting development in our region. China and Taiwan\nhave longstanding differences. All of us in the Pacific\nwant to see them resolve their dispute amicably\nthrough dialogue and a common vision.\nWe welcome the peace mission by the Prime\nMinister of Japan to normalize relations with North\nKorea. We hope that his visit will also have the added\nimpetus of encouraging North and South Korea to\nintensify their contacts and dialogue for a peaceful\naccord between them.\nJapan, itself, is setting an example of how a\ndeveloped nation can use its resources to help others.\nIn Johannesburg, Japan was more forthcoming than\nmost affluent countries in its willingness to act on the\nSummit agenda and decisions. It is already playing a\nvery positive role in the South Pacific.\nFiji reiterates its support for Japan as a permanent\nmember of the Security Council, along with China.\nIn concluding, let me reaffirm that, in a world\nstill threatened by conflict and war, the Pacific Island\nForum and the ACP Group stand firmly for peace. We\nsay the best way of securing that and protecting our\nprecious planet is to uphold the multilateralism\nrepresented by the United Nations and its family of\nnations. For peace to endure, the United Nations must\ncontinue to ensure that development and opportunities\nfor economic and social progress are spread and shared\nevenly among all its Member States.\nAt Johannesburg, we all agreed to promote\npartnerships to assist developing countries in dealing\nmore effectively with the basic needs of their peoples.\nFrom our experience with our trade and development\npartnerships, with Australia and New Zealand and with\nthe European Union, the Pacific Islands and ACP\ncountries commit themselves to working closely with\nthe United Nations system and other multilateral\norganizations, like the World Trade Organization, in\npromoting similar partnerships with other developed\ncountries.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI\nshould like to begin by congratulating Mr. Kavan on\nhis well-deserved election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-seventh session and to\nassure him of my delegation's full support and\ncooperation.\nI would also like to commend his predecessor,\nMr. Han Seung-soo, for having skilfully presided over\nthe work of the fifty-sixth session. Similarly, I would\nlike to express my delegation's sincere appreciation to\nMr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, for the able\nmanner in which he has continued to manage the day-\nto-day affairs of our Organization in the face of\nnumerous and daunting challenges.\nMy delegation wishes to join others in welcoming\nthe admission to the United Nations of Switzerland, a\ncountry that has done so much for the Organization\nover the years. I would also like to welcome East\nTimor to the community of nations, following the\nsuccessful tutelage of the United Nations.\nAs we commemorate the first anniversary of the\ntragic events of the 11 September terrorist attacks, I\nwould like to take this opportunity to reiterate\nTanzania's solidarity and support for international\nefforts to fight terrorism. Coming from a country that\nexperienced a similar tragedy four years ago, I\nunderstand the continued pain and suffering of those\nwho lost their loved ones as they come to terms with\nthe aftermath of those tragic events. We have every\nconfidence that, through our collective efforts, the war\non terrorism will ultimately be won.\nIt is a welcome coincidence that the fifty-seventh\nsession should be held so soon after the World Summit\non Sustainable Development. Tanzania is glad that\npoverty eradication was underscored as humanity's\ncritical challenge and an indispensable requirement for\nsustainable development, particularly in the developing\ncountries.\nIt was very gratifying, indeed, to note that due\nregard was also given to the burning issues of\n15\n\neducation, health, energy, shelter, water and sanitation,\nas well as agriculture, in particular food security. The\nabundance of pledges from all speakers and\nparticipants to fight poverty, promote social and\neconomic development and enhance measures to deal\nwith pollution and protect the environment was very\nreassuring indeed. However, many stakeholders,\nincluding those from my country, are anxiously waiting\nto see how we move beyond rhetoric to concrete action.\nThose of us from the developing countries know\ntoo well in this regard that our biggest challenge is to\nget our act together by practicing and observing good\ngovernance, democracy, the rule of law and human\nrights. We have to institute sound political, social and\neconomic policies, as well as to fight corruption and\ngraft. We have to create conditions conducive to\ninvestment flows and trade. Fortunately, this is no\nlonger wanting, because most of our countries have\nmade serious efforts to meet these ideals with\nreasonable success. However, it is frustrating to note\nthat there is little appreciation of these achievements.\nInstead, there is amplification of the little that is yet to\nbe overcome. Many of us feel that we deserve to be\ntreated better.\nIt is surprising also to note the temptation in some\nquarters to evolve a new paradigm in international\nrelations  that of assigning collective responsibility,\ncondemnation and punishment to a region or continent\nfor the mistakes of one country in that part of the\nworld. A crisis in an African country, for example, is\nmeant to be left to African countries to fix and they are\nthreatened with being held responsible and accountable\nif that is not done. Several times, we have been\nreminded to sort out the problem in some crisis-\nstricken African countries or else risk losing\ncooperation on the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment (NEPAD) from the developed countries.\nTanzania considers such tendencies not only to be\nstrange, but also dangerous, unfair, discriminatory and\ntotally unacceptable. Let all of us continue to work\ntogether to resolve problems facing our countries and\npeoples wherever they may occur.\nWe look forward to seeing the developed\ncountries of the North play their part, as is expected of\nthem, as expressed in the millennium development\ngoals, the Monterrey Consensus, the Brussels Plan of\nAction for the least developed countries, the Doha\nagreement and the Johannesburg Plan of Action and at\nyesterday's historic high-level plenary meeting of the\nGeneral Assembly on support for NEPAD. We consider\nthe role of the developed countries to be very critical to\nsuccess in the war against poverty and the attainment\nof sustainable development. We look forward to seeing\nthe countries of the North increase official\ndevelopment assistance to the countries of the South.\nAt Monterrey, Kananaskis and Johannesburg,\nthere were good signs that this is now possible.\nHowever, when one looks at the resource requirement\nof the millennium goals and the time frame for\nimplementation, the promises made are far below\ntarget. At Monterrey and Kananaskis, some $12 billion\nwere pledged over a period of three to four years,\nwhereas the requirement is $50 billion annually until\n2015. We appeal to the developed countries to commit\nmore resources and within the time frames set out in\nthe millennium development goals.\nAnother important area where the intervention of\nthe developed countries is essential is debt relief. Debt\nservicing is crippling the economies and Governments\nof the poor developing countries. Debt relief releases\nresources which can be used to finance priority sectors\nand activities, such as education, health, energy, water,\nrural roads and microfinance schemes.\nLet me take the example of my country, Tanzania.\nAfter reaching the completion point for the Heavily\nIndebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative and the\ncancellation of a portion of the external debt,\nGovernment expenditure on basic social services has\nincreased to unprecedented levels. We will now be able\nto give clean water to more people than we could have\ndone in the past. We are now able to hire more\nteachers, build more classrooms, take more students\ninto schools and buy more textbooks and teaching\nmaterials. We have improved health-care delivery\nsystems. We have hired more medical practitioners in\nrural dispensaries and health centres and we have\nprovided more equipment and medicines. There are\nmore rural roads maintained now than before and new\nones are being opened up. The list of benefits is long\nand we could have done much more if we had got a\nbigger debt-cancellation package. That is why we\ncontinue to appeal for deeper debt cancellation for\nTanzania and the rest of the least developed countries.\nMoreover, the amount of debt that has not been\nforgiven to my country is not payable, given our level\nof poverty.\n16\n\nDebt cancellation or relief on its own cannot\nsolve the resource needs of developing countries.\nMeasures to make capital and financial resources\navailable for investments and trade in the developing\ncountries are very important. To date, not much has\ncome to our part of the world, despite our having put in\nplace the most competitive investment incentives. May\nI once again appeal to the Governments of the\ndeveloped countries to intervene in the most judicious\nway possible to encourage investment flows to Africa\nand the developing countries. I believe that their words\nof encouragement and support will have a positive\nimpact.\nMarket access is another very important matter\nfor us. We highly appreciate and thank the United\nStates and the European Union for granting duty-free\nand quota-free access for goods from Africa and the\nAfrican, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States\nrespectively. This has acted as an important stimulus to\nincreased production and investments in our countries.\nWe welcome similar decisions taken by Japan, Canada\nand China, thus further expanding Africa's market\naccess. However, agricultural subsidies in the\ndeveloped countries remain an obstacle to which we\nagain appeal to the developed countries to give due\nconsideration.\nAs we all know, it is in agriculture that we have\nthe best of the comparative advantage. Unhindered\naccess to the markets of the developed countries,\ntherefore, could have immeasurable benefits. I am of\nthe view that the developed countries can afford to\ndispense with subsidies to agriculture. Instead, the $1\nbillion spent on such subsidies daily could be used to\nfund the implementation of millennium development\ngoals.\nAmong today's daunting global challenges are the\nconflict situations in Africa and the escalation of\nviolence in the Middle East. We highly appreciate the\nproactive role played by the United Nations, countries\nof the respective regions and the international\ncommunity in trying to mediate and end the conflicts.\nWe pray for the continued involvement of the\ninternational community in putting an end to conflicts.\nThe framework for the resumption of negotiations\nbetween Israel and the Government of Palestine\nalready exists. Both sides must create an environment\nconducive to negotiations. There has to be an end to\nIsraeli occupation of Arab lands and significant\nmovement towards the creation of a viable Palestinian\nState living side by side with Israel as an imperative to\nlasting peace in the Middle East. The security concerns\nof Israel should be addressed and encoded properly in\nany agreement. In this regard, all relevant Security\nCouncil and General Assembly resolutions must be\nadhered to.\nIt is our conviction that, without the active\ninvolvement of a third party, not much can be achieved.\nTanzania is convinced that the Security Council, as\nwell as the United States, the Russian Federation, the\nEuropean Union and the Arab League, can play a\npivotal role in getting to a sustainable solution.\nFortunately, all of these are now actively involved. We\nappeal to them to remain seized of the problem and to\ncontinue to work together.\nThe situation in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo and Burundi remains a major concern and\npreoccupation of Tanzania and other countries in the\nregion. I want to reaffirm the continued commitment\nand readiness of my Government to contribute in any\nway possible towards building a peaceful, secure and\nstable Great Lakes region.\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it is\nencouraging to note that there are some positive\ndevelopments following the recent agreement and\nunderstanding reached between that country, Rwanda\nand Uganda. It is our hope that the implementation of\nthe agreements and understanding will be scrupulously\nobserved. We welcome the undertaking of the United\nNations and the Republic of South Africa to help the\nparties.\nThe security situation in Burundi is fragile. The\nnew transitional Government installed on 1 November\n2001 is functioning, but the continuation of the civil\nwar seems to be undermining its base. Tanzania\nunderscores the significance of getting a ceasefire\nagreement for the sake of the people of Burundi and\nthe success of the transitional Government. It was in\nappreciation of that imperative that my President\naccepted the request of the facilitator and that of\nPresident Pierre Buyoya of Burundi for Tanzania to\nhelp urge the rebels to come to the negotiating table.\nWe tried our best and, as a result, the Burundi\nGovernment and the rebels started direct talks in Dar es\n17\n\nSalaam on 12 August. The negotiations are continuing.\nThey are not easy, but we are confident that they will\nbe crowned with success. Tanzania will continue to\nassist in and work for the success of the negotiations.\nWe do so on the clear understanding that we stand to\ngain more from a peaceful and stable Burundi and to\nlose if there is war and lack of stability. The end of the\nrefugee problem, as well as the end of mistrust between\nour two Governments and the free flow of trade across\nour common borders, are the obvious benefits which\nwe long to see realized.\nOne of the serious consequences of the conflicts\nin the Great Lakes region has been the massive\ndisplacement of people and the influx of refugees,\nwhich constitute a huge burden for Tanzania. At\npresent, Tanzania is hosting close to a million refugees\nfrom Rwanda, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo. While we appreciate the work being done\nby the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian agencies to\nprotect the refugees, much remains to be done to offset\nthe burden which these refugees place upon my\ncountry. We would like to see more being done to\nfacilitate repatriation of the refugees.\nUnfortunately, the 1951 Convention is not as\nelaborate concerning the responsibilities of refugee-\ngenerating countries or those of the international\ncommunity as it is on the responsibilities of the\nrefugee-receiving countries. This is probably due to the\ncontext in which the Convention was conceived. The\nsituation has changed. Tanzania feels strongly that\nthere is a need to review the 1951 Convention to keep\nit in step with changing times and circumstances.\nThe long and protracted war in Angola appears to\nhave ended. However, Angola still needs the continued\nsupport of the international community to deal with the\nreconstruction and the huge humanitarian crisis facing\nthe country. Tanzania welcomes the decision on\ncontinued United Nations involvement.\nWith regard to Western Sahara, Tanzania firmly\nbelieves that the United Nations cannot, and must not,\nretreat from this unfinished agenda. Tanzania wishes to\nreiterate its longstanding support for the efforts of the\nUnited Nations, which will enable the Sahrawi people\nto exercise their right to self-determination.\nWhile we appreciate the progress made in the\nreform of the working methods of the Security Council,\nwe remain concerned that no movement has been\nrecorded in the area of expansion of membership.\nTanzania would like to reiterate its support for Africa's\nquest for two permanent seats.\nIn his address to the Assembly on 4 October\n1996, my President, Mr. Benjamin Mkapa, said:\nThe founding of the United Nations was inspired\nby the human solidarity which the world sought\nto promote five decades ago... What holds our\nnations together, despite their diversity, is the\ncommon bond and solidarity we feel for each\nother as human beings. Today, more than ever\nbefore, we need that solidarity in order to deal\nwith the myriad problems we all face together'.\nThese words were relevant then, and they are still\nrelevant today.\n\n\n\n"

We welcome its brand-new independence.\nThe Timorese people have freely chosen, through the\nexercise of their right to self-determination, to be the\nmasters of their own fate. We congratulate them once\nagain for having stood firm, and we welcome them and\nwish them a future of progress, prosperity and peace.\nIt has been two years now since the historic\nMillennium Declaration was adopted. In offering a\ncollective response, in a spirit of solidarity, to the\nchallenges facing the world in the areas of peace,\nsecurity and the eradication of poverty, the\ninternational community took a responsible approach to\nthe situation that, given the subsequent events that\ndisrupted and shook the world, make that Declaration\nseem to have foreshadowed the present.\nThe tragic events of 11 September 2001, which\nwe commemorated just a few days ago, highlighted the\nneed for a collective response to this global threat of\nterrorism. For a decade, Algeria has had to face alone\nthis scourge of the modern age. We are glad that there\nis now greater awareness of this phenomenon within\nthe international community and of the measures that\nneed to be taken to address it.\n2\n\nAlgeria participated in the efforts to conclude the\nconventions to combat terrorism adopted within the\nvarious regional African, Arab and Islamic\norganizations of which Algeria is a member. Those\nconventions made a significant contribution to\nstrengthening the international legal framework\nessential for any action for effective international\ncooperation in combating terrorism.\nWe believe that it is a matter of urgency to adopt\na comprehensive convention on combating terrorism,\nwhich would provide a normative framework for\nbringing together the various cooperation agreements\nin the anti-terrorist struggle. We must go beyond our\ndifferences in respect of how we define terrorism in\nseeking one acceptable to all, avoiding ambiguities that\nwe all condemn.\nMore specifically, we reject any association\nbetween Islam and terrorist activities. We cannot\nequate terrorism with the fight by people who are\ndeprived of their rights  an unequal fight that they\nare waging with all the resources and weapons\navailable to them.\nBecause of the excesses committed by the Israeli\noccupiers, the international community has defined the\nconditions necessary to bring back a just and lasting\npeace in Palestine and in the Middle East. The\nconditions include the rejection of violence, the\nresumption of negotiations based on the principle of\nland for peace, and  a cardinal point the\nconfirmation of the right of the Palestinian people to\nestablish a State within recognized and secure borders,\nand its corollary, two States  Palestinian and\nIsraeli  living in peace, side by side.\nThe Beirut Arab initiative offered the outline for\nsuch a settlement, based on international law and the\nprinciple of land for peace.\nThat Arab initiative was welcomed by the United\nNations and the co-sponsors of the peace process, and\nit breathed new life into a peace process that had been\nlanguishing. Algeria, today as in the past, stands side\nby side with the Palestinian people in their exemplary\nstruggle for freedom and dignity, which can succeed\nonly when the legitimate national rights of the\nPalestinian people are recognized, including its right to\nthe establishment of an independent State, with Al-\nQuds as its capital, and a complete Israeli withdrawal\nfrom all Arab territories occupied since 1967. That is\nthe only way to bring peace, stability and security back\nto the sensitive region of the Middle East.\nIn that same region, in Iraq, positive\ndevelopments have just occurred which give grounds\nfor hope that the logic of war will finally be replaced\nby the logic of peace. In agreeing to the return to its\nterritory of United Nations inspectors, Iraq has\ndemonstrated that it is committed to cooperating with\nthe international community so that there can be\ndefinitive closure on the question of weapons of mass\ndestruction. That was a courageous decision by the\nIraqi Government, which must logically lead to the\ndefinitive lifting of sanctions, which have hurt the Iraqi\npeople so badly, and to bringing back peace and\nsecurity to that country and to the region as a whole, in\nstrict respect of the sovereignty and unity of the Iraqi\npeople and of the territorial integrity of its national\nterritory.\nClose by Algeria, in Western Sahara, 27 years\nafter the withdrawal of the former colonial Power, the\nSahrawi people are still demanding their inalienable\nright to self-determination, pursuant to General\nAssembly resolution 1514 (XV) and to the resolutions\nthat the General Assembly has been adopting and\nconfirming year after year, since it called in 1966 for\nthe decolonization of the territory and for self-\ndetermination for the people through a referendum.\nThe international community cannot remain\nindifferent to the fate of that people, nor can it accept\nthat the full implementation of the Settlement Plan and\nof the Huston agreements be postponed time and again.\nAlgeria, a neighbour to the two brotherly peoples\nof Morocco and Western Sahara, will continue to do its\nutmost in the service of international peace and of\nstability and unity in the subregion. Algeria has fully\nsupported the efforts made by the Secretary-General\nand his Personal Envoy, and we have made a\nsignificant contribution to the settlement of the\nconflict. The United Nations  and the Security\nCouncil in particular  is dealing with the issue of\nWestern Sahara. Algeria hopes that its relationships\nwith its neighbours will not be jeopardized by this\ndispute and that the Arab Maghreb Union will be able\nto resume its activities and develop fruitful cooperation\nwith all the countries in the region.\nThis session is taking place at a time when\nglobalization is accelerating and an information and\ncommunication technologies revolution is under way.\n3\n\nQuestions continue to arise about the benefits and\nchallenges of this process and the risks of\nmarginalization and exclusion that it poses for the\ndeveloping countries, particularly in Africa. This\nsession is of particular significance because it is taking\nplace in the immediate aftermath of the International\nConference on Financing for Development and the\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development, two\nevents that could prove decisive for the future of\ninternational cooperation for sustainable, balanced and\nequitable development.\nWhile the process that was launched at Monterrey\nidentified how financing is to be mobilized and\nfinancial and technical cooperation for development\nstrengthened, the Johannesburg Summit focused on the\npriority areas of combating poverty and ensuring\nsustainable development and international cooperation.\nThe right to development must be the main focus\nof our concern and efforts to strengthen international\ncooperation through various innovative partnerships\nbetween the North and the South, based on the sharing\nof responsibilities and benefits. In this connection, I\nwould like to mention the signing this year of the\nAssociation Agreement between Algeria and the\nEuropean Union. That Agreement will provide the\nfoundation for launching a genuine, mutually beneficial\npartnership.\nProblems relating to internationalizing foreign\ndirect investment flows as much as possible,\nsignificantly increasing official development\nassistance, managing the debt burden, opening markets\nto the products of the South and restructuring the\ninternational financial institutions to allow for greater\nparticipation by developing countries clearly remain\nour major concerns, and we need to find solutions to\nthem quickly.\nGiven the serious crises that are convulsing the\nworld, the establishment of a more equitable\ninternational economic and trade order is becoming\nincreasingly important, and will require greater\npolitical will on the part of the international\ncommunity.\nThe outcome of the most recent World Trade\nOrganization meeting at Doha provided us with an\nopportunity to set up a more open and transparent\nmultilateral trading system to enable developing\ncountries to increase their share of international trade.\nI would also like to refer to the bilateral and\nmultilateral initiatives that have been undertaken to\nassist developing countries, in particular the least\ndeveloped among them. I hope that such initiatives will\nbe followed up with other specific steps that can give\nreal meaning to international solidarity and to sustained\nefforts aimed at building a more humanistic world, free\nfrom the seeds of instability and violence.\nThe world is changing very quickly, resulting in\nenormous uncertainty about the future of the human\nrace. We note the tendency, in the light of such\ndangers, to move towards international solidarity, not\nonly in the area of combating terrorism, but also in\nfighting poverty and preserving the environment. The\nimportance of the role played by the United Nations in\nfinding solutions to the problems facing all of our\npeoples is becoming increasingly clear. In a world at\nrisk, this Organization is, indeed, irreplaceable,\nbecause it symbolizes our common commitment to\nfight for the survival of humankind.\nThe achievements of the United Nations are\nimpressive in the areas of promoting peace and\nsecurity, economic cooperation, social progress,\nhumanitarian activities and the development of\ninternational law. The fact that such achievements have\nbeen made despite difficulties and inadequate resources\nis an indication of what the system would be capable of\nwere it fully supported by all Member States.\nEfforts to streamline United Nations activities,\nimprove system-wide coordination and ensure\ncoherence in its actions augur well for the\nenhancement, greater credibility and effectiveness of\nthe Organization.\nI should like to pay tribute to the leadership of the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, in this\nundertaking, which will require a greater commitment\non the part of States as well as the provision of more\nresources.\nStrengthening the credibility and effectiveness of\nthe United Nations will also require structural reform\nso as to enable it to better reflect the new face of\ninternational society and deal with all of the challenges\nfacing humankind.\nIn this new millennium, the world will not be able\nto manage without the United Nations. An\nOrganization that is in tune with the requirements of\nchange in the world today is an indispensable tool in\n4\n\nhelping us to build peace and comprehensive\nsustainable development.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAs we welcome our\nnewest members, Switzerland and East Timor, we\nreaffirm our faith in the United Nations and in the\nprinciples of the Charter.\nToday, the United Nations faces more challenges\nand must respond to far more demands than were ever\ncontemplated by its founders. Yet the Organization\nremains the single most important universal and viable\nforum for States to interact, for nations to work\ntogether and for countries to cooperate in preserving\npeace, in avoiding conflict and in promoting stability.\nWe believe that Iraq took a step in the right\ndirection when it agreed yesterday to the unconditional\nreturn of United Nations weapons inspectors. But the\nimmediate challenge facing the Organization and our\nworld is the looming confrontation that could be\nbrought about by the need for Iraq to comply, totally\nand unconditionally, with the relevant Security Council\nresolutions. We credit the diplomatic skills and the\nsheer determination of Secretary-General Kofi Annan\nand of the members of the Arab League with this\nwelcome development. We will, therefore, await clear\nproof of sincerity in action.\nBut this is just a beginning. We believe that we\nare far from a true resolution of this issue. We must\nremain vigilant and must continue to have faith in the\nSecurity Council. The Philippines has full confidence\nin the Council process. We believe that the Council\nwill act in accordance with the imperatives of world\npeace and security and that it will find the most\nexpeditious and effective way to serve those\nimperatives.\nConsistent with its national interest, and in\naccordance with its Constitution, the Philippines is\nprepared to extend political, security and humanitarian\nassistance to the United States and to the international\ncommunity in the pursuit of their most vital interest,\nwhich coincides with our own vital interests: to defeat\nterrorism. The case for compliance is compelling. The\ncharges are highly credible and have serious\nimplications for global security. The Security Council\nshould give those charges the most urgent and\nprofound consideration. The international community\nhas put the onus on Iraq to comply with the relevant\nCouncil resolutions, especially with regard to the\nelimination of weapons of mass destruction.\nYet we certainly live in a world of consequences\nthat can be avoided. Poverty, intolerance and inequality\nprovide the breeding ground for terrorism. But we need\nnot make terrorism an unavoidable consequence of\nthose factors. We have learned that in the one year\nsince the shocking and tragic events of 11 September.\nIn that short span of time, we have learned that\nterrorism cannot defeat us and that it cannot overcome\nour resolve to fight it, and we have learned the full\n13\n\nmeasure of the bravery of the men and women who\nstand on the front lines in the war against terror. In that\nshort span of time, we have established new strategic\npartnerships and have retooled and rearmed existing\nstrategic partnerships. Those partnerships are based on\nthe belief that the world will never be secure unless\nterrorist lairs are exposed and destroyed and unless\nterrorist supporters are brought to justice.\nIn the realm of what is just and what is fair, we\nknow that globalization can contribute to the\ncomprehensive and sustainable development of the\ndeveloping world. Indeed, in some cases it has done so.\nBut the gap between the rich and poor countries\ncontinues to widen.\nLet us again remind ourselves of the stark reality\nthat 1.2 billion people live on less than $1 a day; 1.1\nbillion people lack access to safe and affordable\ndrinking water; and 130 million school-age children,\nthe majority of whom are girls, lack the means to stay\nin school.\nThe uneven spread of opportunities for the\ncreation of wealth, and the increasing income\ninequality within and between countries, have pushed\nlarger numbers of people to the margins of existence.\nWe in the Philippines are building an open\neconomy. We are taking concrete measures to create an\nopen trade and investment environment in our own\ncountry and in our region. We have adapted to the\nrealities of globalization, fully aware of the\nconcomitant risks, particularly those that impinge on\nthe well-being of our vulnerable and disadvantaged\ngroups.\nWe firmly believe that, in general, developing\ncountries accept the need for good governance in their\npublic and corporate sectors. We are continuing our\ninstitutional reform, guided by our national priorities,\nrequirements and capabilities. We are taking great\npains to restructure our economy, often at high political\ncost.\nCapital is what developing countries lack most in\ntheir pursuit of sustainable development. The Food and\nAgriculture Organization has estimated that an\nadditional annual public investment of $24 billion must\nbe made in poor countries in order to halve the number\nof hungry people by the United Nations millennium\ntarget date of 2015.\nDeveloping countries need more foreign direct\ninvestment, particularly in areas that will promote the\nsustainable use of the environment and sustained\ngrowth. We also need improved access to foreign\nmarkets.\nMany developing countries must also effectively\ncompete in areas where their comparative advantage is\ngreat, such as agriculture. However, developing\ncountries do not have the resources to match the\nsubsidies that agricultural producers receive in rich\ncountries, such as the 40 billion euros that European\nUnion farmers receive each year or the additional $170\nbillion that United States farmers will receive over the\nnext 10 years. We can only wonder what the liberating\nimpact would be on development if the subsidies of 23\ncents per dollar for farm goods in the United States or\nthe 36 cents per dollar on farm goods in the European\nUnion were instead invested in developing countries.\nWe need to reverse the decline in official\ndevelopment assistance, which remains below the\ntarget of 0.7 per cent of gross national product. But we\nshould also not lose sight of the fact that, aside from\nincreased funding sources for developing countries, the\nflip side of the development coin should be greater\nrestraint, care and flexibility in the use of\nconditionalities. Enhanced and effective debt relief,\nincluding for middle-income countries, is also needed.\nEfforts to reform the international financial\narchitecture and to strengthen the development\ndimension of the global trade and investment regime\nshould be sustained.\nGlobalization has provided more opportunities\nand greater choices for people who want to travel the\nworld in search of a livelihood. Some 10 per cent of the\npeople of the Philippines are outside its border. Their\nsafety and welfare is of paramount importance to us,\nparticularly in times of actual or potential conflict. The\nwelfare of migrant workers should be placed higher on\nthe United Nations agenda now, before the migrant\nissue turns into a serious humanitarian problem. We\ncan start by becoming States parties to the United\nNations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of\nAll Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.\nIt is also important for developed nations to support the\nimportant work of humanitarian assistance agencies\nlike the International Organization for Migration.\nDespite the unprecedented wealth created in the\nlast decade of the twentieth century, one out of every\n14\n\nfive people lives on less than $1 a day. The 32 poorest\nAfrican countries do not earn much more than the\nrichest man on earth, the title unofficially bestowed\nupon Bill Gates, the Chairman of Microsoft, in the\nUnited States. Despite the grinding poverty in which\nbillions of people live, the world spends incredible\nsums for military purposes  for armies and weapons\nof mass annihilation.\nThose bent on fomenting hate and violence will\nfind willing adherents, particularly among the helpless,\nand hopeless poor, the dispossessed and the\ndisenfranchised. The hungry, the young people who do\nnot go to school and those living in the margins of\nsociety can become easy prey to the siren songs of\nterrorists and the perpetrators of violence. Poverty\nalleviation and development are therefore key\nstrategies in preventing conflict and fighting terrorism.\nTerrorism has become a major cause of violence\nand instability in our world. But this is not the only\nmenace to our collective security. Organized crime,\nenvironmental degradation and contagious diseases\ncontinue to threaten international peace and security.\nThe proliferation of conventional and non-conventional\nweapons, including small arms, is continuing. Civil\nwars and inter-State conflicts remain major causes of\ninstability and underdevelopment. The United Nations\nmust therefore continue to play its important\npeacekeeping and peacemaking role.\nDurable peace and progress with freedom can be\nachieved only through international partnerships and a\nrenewed faith in the United Nations, which should\nguarantee meaningful participation by developing\ncountries in global decision-making. The challenges of\nthe world today  potential and actual conflict,\nterrorism, violence, environmental degradation,\norganized crime and contagious diseases  recognize\nno boundaries and affect all.\nIn the eloquent language of the Philadelphia\nDeclaration of the International Labour Organization,\npoverty anywhere constitutes a danger to prosperity\neverywhere'. That is the case because humanity  and\nhuman destiny  has become a seamless whole. No\nman is an island, and the bell tolls for us, too. This is\nthe timeless vision of the United Nations, validated by\nall who have spoken here at the fifty-seventh session of\nthe General Assembly. It is a vision and a bond that\nshould unite all nations as we face new dangers and the\nunmarked frontiers of our collective life on this small,\nendangered planet. Indeed, the United Nations\ncontinues to be the last best hope of mankind.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI convey my\ncongratulations to Mr. Jan Kavan on his election to the\npresidency of this body. I should also like to express\nonce again to Secretary-General Kofi Annan my\nhighest appreciation and to assure him of my support.\nIt is with satisfaction that Poland welcomes in our\nmidst the newest Member of the United Nations,\nSwitzerland, and looks forward to welcoming soon the\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste.\nWis\u0142awa Szymborska, the Polish poet and Nobel\nPrize winner, wrote the following words dedicated to\nthe victims of 11 September:\n\u201cThey plunged down from heights ablaze ...\nFor them, I can do but two things \u2014 depict their\nflight and leave the last sentence unfinished ...\u201d\nI believe that every one of us travelling to this\nbrave city shared similar thoughts. All of us must have\nasked ourselves what is being expected of us, where we\nare today and what obligations we are to fulfil to\nensure that such horror never happens again. No doubt,\n11 September was a wake-up call for all of us. It may\nhave not changed the world, but it certainly has\nfundamentally changed the way we perceive it. History\nhas yet again given us the responsibility to face the\nchallenge and to leave a better and safer world for\nfuture generations. But then, after all, is that not what\nwe are really here for?\nMany of my colleague representatives touched\nupon that issue in recent days. The messages delivered\nhere just four days ago by Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan and President George W. Bush are especially\nsignificant. In that regard, we also share the opinions\nexpressed by a number of other speakers, in particular\nby the Prime Minister of Denmark, Mr. Anders Fogh\nRasmussen, speaking in his capacity as the President of\nthe European Union.\nToday the United Nations stands at a crossroads,\nfacing a choice that needs to be made. Either we will\nfind internal strength to stand up to the challenge and\nprove that the United Nations is more than a mere\ndiscussion forum or we will lose credibility forever.\nOnce again, as was the case at the inception of the\nOrganization over half a century ago, we must take the\nissue of security seriously, especially as terrorism has\ngiven it a new dimension.\nAs a founding Member of the United Nations,\nPoland will continue to support all efforts aimed at\npreserving the Organization's unique position. We fully\nagree with what the Secretary-General said, that we can\nonly succeed if we make full use of multilateral\n21\n\ninstitutions. We share the position of President Bush\nthat the United Nations must be effective and\nsuccessful and that its resolutions must be enforced.\nWe are convinced that the Security Council must find\nenough strength in the nearest future to set the course\nfor a decision-making process in the United Nations\naimed at concrete action. This time, we are left with a\nvery small margin. This is a test that international\ncommunity has to pass. Failure would undermine both\nthe integrity of the United Nations and the security of\nthe whole world.\nI think the most appropriate motto for my further\nreflections on the future of the United Nations is\ncontained in the Secretary-General's millennium\nreport. He wrote that\n\u201cIf the international community were to\ncreate a new United Nations tomorrow, its make-\nup would surely be different from the one we\nhave.\u201d (A/54/2000, para. 352)\nIt would be highly unfortunate if the millennium\nreport, and especially its conclusions relating to the\nrole of the United Nations and the reform of the\nOrganization, were to fade into oblivion. Only the\nUnited Nations, given its exceptional legitimacy\nstemming from the universal character of both its\nmembership and its mandate can \u2014 and, indeed, ought\nto \u2014 rise to the challenges posed to the international\ncommunity. But for that to happen its prerogatives,\nrules and instruments would have to be geared to the\nneeds of today and the threats of tomorrow.\nWe should consider the elaboration of a document\nthat would be neither a draft revision of the Charter nor\na supplement to it. What I would like to suggest is that\nwe make an attempt to acknowledge the new reality\nand try a new road. I am by no means being original or\nprecedent-setting in calling for this. The Atlantic\nCharter and the New Atlantic Charter, the 1975\nHelsinki Final Act and the 1990 Charter of Paris for a\nNew Europe have all been there before. In other words,\nadapting an organization's mandate to make it relevant\nto new needs without actually revising its founding act\nhas already been tested.\nThere is a widespread sense that some provisions\nof the United Nations Charter having actually become a\ndead letter. That applies to both the substance of those\nprovisions and to the procedural solutions they offer.\nSome of the Charter's provisions and organs have\ncompleted the tasks assigned to them and are now\nredundant. But the Organization does need new\nmechanisms to run peacekeeping operations. It is\nimpossible to comprehend why we still keep in place\nclauses on \u201cenemy States\u201d while the United Nations\nhas no regulations to properly address the problems\nrelated to its humanitarian interventions. There is a\ngeneral acceptance of the need for clear lines to be\ndrawn to mark new areas of responsibility for a number\nof important United Nations organs.\nThe values, purposes and principles of the United\nNations, enshrined in the Preamble and in Articles 1\nand 2 of the Charter, have not lost their relevance.\nThey have stood the test of time. A document that\ncould be considered as a new act for the United\nNations at the dawn of the twenty-first century could\ngive fresh impetus to the principles, organs and\nmechanisms of the United Nations and make them\nmore responsive to the needs and challenges that today\ndominate the life of the international community. Let\nme point out four groups of problems that should be\ntackled, starting with new threats to security.\nThe Charter makes reference to threats\ntraditionally raised by States. The Charter's provisions\nconcerning the Security Council and its composition\nand instruments, as well as the other Chapters dealing\nwith security, are now insufficient. That fact is borne\nout by the numerous developments of recent years,\nincluding the attack of 11 September and its\nconsequences.\nThen there is acute poverty, which is evident in\nmany parts of the world; chronic underdevelopment;\npandemic disease; lack of education and medical care;\nand deepening differences in living conditions and\ndevelopmental standards. All of these are unacceptable\npolitically and morally.\nHuman rights, the rule of law, democracy, good\ngovernance and civil society make up the third group\nof problems that I have been thinking about.\nThe fourth group is made up of themes related to\nsustainable development. The focus on the protection\nof the human habitat, which is indispensable to the\nsurvival of the human race, and on the common\nheritage of mankind.\nMoreover, existing United Nations principles\nmust be expanded, or new ones developed, in order for\nthe Organization to pursue its actions along the\nfollowing three dimensions, namely, in manifestations\n22\n\nof multilateralism in the work of the United Nations\nwhile reconciling broad representation and collectivism\nwith effectiveness; in the subsidiarity of the\nOrganization's work to better utilize the means and\nresources available to Member States, specifically with\nregard to United Nations regional arrangements; and,\nfinally, in getting non-governmental entities, including\nprivate capital, involved in United Nations work in a\nway that will not detract from the democratic nature of\nthe Organization nor erode its governmental character\nand efficiency while increasing its resources and\neffectiveness.\nI dare say that no country, group of countries or\nregional agencies meeting the Organization's criteria\nwould be capable of taking up the totality of problems\nsuch an undertaking would have to address. Subject to\nappropriate consultations involving the membership of\nthe Organization and the Secretary-General, we might\nwish to establish a \u201cgroup of sages\u201d made up of\noutstanding personalities. The group would draft an\nappropriate document that would then be reviewed and\napproved by Member States. That document should be\npolitically binding in nature, which would make it\ncomplementary to the legal grounding contained in the\nCharter and provide a platform for the United Nations\nactions over the coming decades.\nWe should think about the future and work on its\nfoundations, but without losing sight of present-day\nachievements. The enactment of the Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court is one such achievement.\nIt turns a new page in both international relations and\ninternational law. It is Poland's desire for the treaty\nestablishing the Court to become one of the most\nuniversal documents of its kind. We trust that the\nexisting divergences between respective stands and\nviews can be resolved through dialogue and\ncompromise, according to international law. We have to\nact so as not to disappoint the hopes and expectations\nthat the international community has placed in the\nCourt.\nA year ago, the whole world joined together in an\nunprecedented demonstration of solidarity. Today we\nare more aware of the source and the character of the\nthreat. We are also more capable of dealing with it.\nPoland has joined the ongoing anti-terrorist operation.\nOur soldiers are now deployed in Afghanistan,\nalongside their colleagues from other countries, and are\ndoing their utmost to strengthen security there and to\nhelp raise the country from the rubble and ruin inflicted\nupon it by two decades of war and internal strife.\nFor us that is natural, but we cannot avoid asking\nourselves the question of whether we are any closer\ntoday to fulfilling the ideals towards which we set sail\nhalf a century ago. We now have another chance to\nrevitalize solidarity and work together for values that\nare priceless both to us and to generations to come. Let\nus all create an axis of good that will bring back the\nproper meaning to the term we are so proud of, the\nUnited Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me begin\nby conveying, on behalf of the Sri Lanka delegation,\nour sincere felicitations to Mr. Jan Kavan on his\nelection as President of this fifty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly and our assurances of our fullest\ncooperation.\nI would also like to express appreciation for the\nexemplary manner in which Mr. Han Seung-soo,\nformer Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of\nKorea, guided the work of the fifty-sixth session. We\nalso warmly welcome Switzerland as a new Member of\nthe Organization, and look forward also to welcoming\nEast Timor.\nOur discussions and debates in this Assembly\noften reach great heights and seek grand objectives, but\nultimately they are about the future lives, well-being\nand security of the people we are privileged to\nrepresent. It is with such thoughts in my mind that I\nrecall the horrendous events of 11 September 2001,\nwhich claimed the lives of so many Americans and\npeople of other nationalities from all over the world.\nAs we are only too painfully aware, they are not the\nonly victims of terror.\nThe attack confirmed what we in Sri Lanka have\nlong known: terrorism has long been globalized. As\nPresident Bush acknowledged on 11 March 2002,\n\u201cSeptember 11 was not the beginning of global terror,\nbut it was the beginning of the world's concerted\nresponse.\u201d\nWe in Sri Lanka perhaps know better than most\nthe tragedies that conflict and terrorism create. My own\ncountry has been ravaged by a 20-year conflict, which\nhas caused more than 65,000 deaths. Eight hundred\nthousand people are internally displaced. Tragic stories\nabound: children who will never see their fathers return\nhome; mothers who have lost their sons; and children\nwho, even today, innocently step on anti-personnel\n2\n\nmines. I have talked to the disabled soldiers and the\ndispossessed, the people who have no homes, and those\nwho return to the north-east of our country to find war-\ntorn ruins and once productive fields sown with land\nmines.\nThe election victory last December of the\nGovernment I represent was a clear national mandate to\nend the conflict in the north-east. The Government has\nsince moved swiftly towards the fulfilment of that\nmandate. A ceasefire with the Liberation Tigers of\nTamil Eelam (LTTE) was signed on 22 February this\nyear. The ceasefire has held.\nConfidence-building measures have encouraged\nthe free movement of people throughout the country\nand have revived economic activity. Peace talks with\nthe LTTE, facilitated by Norway, began two days ago\nin Sattahip, Thailand. The Sri Lanka Government has\nunilaterally suspended the proscription of the LTTE in\norder to facilitate the talks, to give peace a chance, and\nto give the LTTE a chance for peace.\nA flexible approach is necessary in the\nnegotiations, combining a warm heart with a cool head.\nAn understanding of the other side, their aspirations\nand their concerns, is essential. Negotiations are\ncomplex and will take time. In the early stages of our\ntalks with the LTTE, we are trying to resolve some of\nthe immediate practical needs of the people in order to\nbring relief and normalcy to our society. Economic\nreconstruction and development of the affected areas\nwill be a deciding factor in sustaining the momentum\nof political negotiations. Development is part of the\nhealing process in a wounded, divided society. The\npressing day-to-day problems of the people need to be\nsettled as soon as possible.\nIndeed, at the discussions in Thailand, there was\nstrong endorsement of the urgent need for resources to\nensure the early dividends of the peace process. The\nrole played by Norway in facilitating that process and,\nmost recently, at the peace talks is deeply appreciated. I\nextend my sincere thanks to Norway for all its efforts.\nAlready, following the ceasefire, there are signs\nof people enjoying their rediscovered freedom. The\npeople want more. Exchange visits between school\nchildren and other groups from the south and from the\nnorth have revealed to many that the other side is not\nso different after all. Last week our capital, Colombo,\ncame to a standstill as people from all over the country,\nfrom every religion and every ethnic group in society,\nflocked to a peace rally.\nThose are all encouraging signs. But with them\ncomes a risk. The imperative of peace is growing. The\npeople demand peace, and the politicians and\nnegotiators on both sides had better deliver. Peace is\npeople-driven. The conflict had dragged our economy\nto near bankruptcy, and last year, for the first time in\nindependent Sri Lanka, we recorded negative growth.\nResources must flow into developing the areas ravaged\nby war. Opportunities must be created. The momentum\nof growth must be re-established. The people want to\nsee normalcy restored, not tomorrow but today. The\nfarmers want their damaged irrigation canals repaired\ntoday; their harvest cannot be delayed until a final\nagreement is reached. This imperative is driven even\nmore by young people among the Sri Lankan armed\nforces and the cadres of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil\nEelam, whose weapons lie silent. Without international\nsupport and help with resources to build a peace\ndividend, the gloss on peace can be dulled. With the\nrecreation of opportunities for people and for growth,\npoliticians and negotiators will be driven even harder\nto stabilize, advance and sustain the peace.\nFrom there, we can approach the complex\nconstitutional issues. Those questions will take time.\nWe believe that the way forward is through a clearly\nrepresentative interim administration within a united\nSri Lanka in which the rights of all communities,\nTamil, Muslim and Sinhalese, are safeguarded. That\nwill allow us to carry forward an initiative to empower\nlocal people by decentralizing governmental authority\nand by establishing five regional economic\ndevelopment zones. Through such initiatives, we intend\nto encourage local people to be responsible for driving\neconomic growth in their own regions. Those\nmeasures, along with the liberalization and\nderegulation of our economy, will generate wealth.\nMeanwhile, there is a pressing, immediate\nsecurity issue. Hundreds of thousands of mines need to\nbe removed from tracts of land to make them safe and\narable in order for the internally displaced persons to\nreturn to their homes and their farms. Sri Lanka is\nreviewing its position on the Ottawa Convention on\nanti-personnel mines with a view to becoming a party\nto it as confidence in peace grows. We are grateful for\nthe help we are receiving from the United Nations,\nmembers of the international community and non-\n3\n\ngovernmental organizations in our demining\nprogramme.\nMy Government is resolved to ensure that the\npeople of the north and east of our Republic should\nalso enjoy the same security and the same quality of\nlife, democratic governance and human rights which\npeople in other parts of the country enjoy. Sri Lanka\nhas a high rating on the Human Development Index of\nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).\nOur per capita income figures and our life expectancy\nand our literacy rates are among the highest in the\nregion. Peace will further enhance all that, but its\ndividend must be credited to all the shareholders in Sri\nLanka's future.\nSri Lanka welcomes the support that our peace\nprocess has received from members of the international\ncommunity and from the United Nations. On a request\nmade by me to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a United\nNations inter-agency needs assessment team visited Sri\nLanka in April and May of this year. The team\ncompleted a strategic overview of the current situation,\nwhich can guide immediate and mid- to long-term\naction by United Nations agencies in Sri Lanka. We\nthank the Secretary-General for his efforts.\nQuickening the pace of peace and having its\ndividends credited directly and urgently to the people\nare imperative. We are grateful to all those who are\nassisting us in Quick Impact Projects. The\nimplementation of those projects without delay will\nhelp peace take root, involve people in the affected\nareas in their economic and social recovery and ease\nthe way for higher stages of development.\nThroughout its long history, there have been\nflattering descriptions of Sri Lanka \u2014 centuries before\nour Tourist Board promoted the serenity of the island.\nThe ancient Arabs and mediaeval Europeans called our\nisland paradise. If in the course of our recent conflict\nsome of the quality of paradise has been lost, then\nsurely paradise must be regained. Regaining Sri Lanka\nis much more than a slogan, it is a practical, doable\nstrategy, in which we invite the international\ncommunity to participate.\nWhile seeking a negotiated solution to our own\nconflict, Sri Lanka strongly supports negotiating a\nsettlement of the Israel-Palestine conflict. We have\nlong supported a responsible peace process which\nwould lead to the acceptance of two States, Israel and\nPalestine, prospering in conditions of peace and\nsecurity, as neighbours, within secure and recognized\nborders. We urge the resumption of a serious dialogue\nbetween Israel and Palestine as a prelude to sustained\nnegotiations.\nIn Sri Lanka, dialogue and negotiations are\nturning around a long, drawn-out conflict. With respect\nto those who were responsible for 11 September, the\napproach needs to be different. No cause justifies the\nkilling of innocent people. Global terrorism must be\neradicated, whatever its manifestation and wherever it\noccurs. We support a comprehensive approach to\ninternational terrorism through the General Assembly's\nAd Hoc Committee on Terrorism. Terrorism has\naffected virtually all the countries of South Asia. A\nmeeting in Sri Lanka will soon draft an additional\nprotocol to the Regional Convention on Suppression of\nTerrorism of the South Asian Association for Regional\nCooperation. The protocol would update the\nConvention, inter alia to meet the obligations\ndevolving on member States in respect of Security\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) and the International\nConvention for the Suppression of the Financing of\nTerrorism.\nThe United Nations has been a source of good\nsince its inception. It is the forum in which there is an\nopportunity for interaction and possible reconciliation\namong complex, competing and even confrontational\nconcerns. Under the Secretary-General's initiative of\nthe Global Compact, it provides for the launching and\nnavigation of positive partnerships between the\ncorporate and State sectors.\nWe also look forward to the implementation of\ndecisions taken at the International Conference on\nFinancing for Development, held in Monterrey. We\nwelcome the Millennium Challenge Account as an\noutcome of that Conference to assist countries\ncommitted to democratic norms and good governance,\nto the engagement of the private sector and to the\ninvolvement of the people in the process of\ndevelopment.\nIn Sri Lanka, we intend to re-establish an\ninvestment-friendly country with an efficient\nbureaucracy and a thriving private sector. On this visit\nto the United States, I have brought a team from my\nindustrial sector to talk to United States businessmen.\nWe are grateful to the United Nations for helping my\nGovernment to organize an investment promotion\nforum in the United States tomorrow with the\n4\n\nparticipation of members of our private sector, who\nwill interact with their counterparts here. Those \u201cclose\nencounters of the business kind\u201d will provide insight\ninto the opportunities for collaborative economic and\ndevelopment ventures in Sri Lanka as we move\nforward on the peace front. Investment in peace makes\nsound political and economic sense for both Sri Lanka\nand its partners abroad. Growth in Sri Lanka will be\ngood for everyone.\nAcross Sri Lanka, the people continue to build\nthe only true peace we can hope for. Without fanfare,\nwithout politicians or media, they are quietly going\nabout their business, finding old friends and building\nnew relationships. Mistrust and suspicion are slowly\nmelting away as people talk and share past experiences.\nThe hatred in some hearts will take a little longer to\ndispel. But even that will be overcome in time by the\ndeep desire for weapons to be destroyed, mines to be\ncleared and the sound of laughter to be heard once\nagain.\nTrusting the people, whether it be for the\nconsolidation of peace or the pursuit of development, is\nthe best policy. We are beholden to the people we work\nfor, whether they be clients or customers or\nshareholders or voters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. It is\nour expectation that your able stewardship will enable\n28\n\nthe work of this session to result in tangible progress. I\nalso appreciate the efforts of Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan towards international peace and sustainable\ndevelopment.\nI am going to contribute to the work of the\nGeneral Assembly by presenting a perspective on the\nsituation of the Korean peninsula, which remains a\nmajor concern in terms of world peace and security.\nMore than 50 years have passed since the division\nof Korea by outside forces. As the Korean people\nundergo immeasurable pain and misfortune due to the\ndivision of the country and the nation, the world\nrealizes that, as long as the homogeneous Korean\nnation remains artificially divided, Korea will never be\npeaceful, nor will peace and security be possible there.\nThe Democratic People's Republic of Korea\nmade reunification the supreme national task from the\nfirst day of the division, and has since adhered to its\nstand with respect to achieving reunification\nindependently, through dialogue and negotiation\nbetween the North and South of Korea.\nThe fatherly leader of our people, President Kim\nIl Sung, long ago set forth the principles and\nprogrammes for reunifying the country independently\nthrough peaceful national unity. He proposed achieving\nreunification by means of a federation system where\ndifferent ideas and systems would continue to exist in\nthe North and the South. He devoted all his efforts to\nnational reunification up until the moment he died.\nThe respected General Kim Jong Il has defined\nthree main charters for national reunification as: the\nthree principles of national reunification; the 10-Point\nProgramme for the Great Unity of the Whole Nation;\nand the proposal on founding the Democratic Federal\nRepublic of Koryo put forward by the fatherly leader.\nThese provide a basis for the country's reunification.\nIt is thanks to the ideas of national independence\nand national unity of the respected General Kim Jong Il\nthat the historic inter-Korean summit meeting took\nplace in Pyongyang in June 2000 and that the North-\nSouth Joint Declaration was adopted; this served as a\nturning point in the efforts of the Korean people for the\ncountry's reunification. The 15 June 2000 North-South\nJoint Declaration is a declaration of national\nindependence and peaceful reunification calling for\nopposing foreign interference and achieving\nreunification by the concerted efforts of the Korean\nnation. After the publication of the North-South Joint\nDeclaration, the North and the South held talks and\nengaged in contacts in various fields, seeking ways and\nmeans to achieve reconciliation and unity. They\ndiscussed measures for cooperation, exchanges and\nrelaxation of tension in Korea; thus the spirit of\nreunification on the Korean peninsula gained\nmomentum.\nHowever, the positive development of inter-\nKorean relations was frustrated by the interference of\nexternal forces, and the North-South Joint Declaration\nthus faced major obstacles.\nIt is fortunate indeed that inter-Korean relations\nhave now been put back on track through the dialogue\nand contacts on implementing the Joint Declaration,\nheld in recent months at the initiative of the\nGovernment of the Democratic People's Republic of\nKorea. The ministerial-level talks were resumed.\nDialogue and contacts in other fields are under way,\nand a national reunification meeting of compatriots\nfrom the North, the South and overseas was held\nsuccessfully on the occasion of the 15 August Korean\nrestoration day.\nThe North and the South have jointly introduced\nan agenda item entitled Peace, security and\nreunification on the Korean Peninsula' at the current\nsession of the General Assembly and have agreed to\ndraw up and submit a draft resolution under that item.\nGovernments and peoples of many countries are\nsupporting and welcoming the emerging d\u00c8tente on the\nKorean peninsula as well as the trend towards\nreconciliation and cooperation between the North and\nthe South.\nThe history of division for more than 50 years is a\nserious lesson for all Korean people. If the\nreunification of the country is to be achieved, the North\nand the South should, above all, reject foreign\ninterference, which is a main obstacle to reunification,\nand should join efforts on the basis of ideas of national\nindependence and great national unity.\nThe modern history of Korea serves as a clear\nillustration of the high price paid and the great\nsacrifices made in succumbing to foreign intervention\nand relying on outside forces. The division of Korea\nwas imposed by outside forces after the Second World\nWar. It was neither the will nor a requirement of the\nKorean people. It is none other than those same foreign\n29\n\nforces that continue to shadow inter-Korean relations at\nevery stage of their favourable development and that\nundermine the interests of the Korean nation. Recourse\nto foreign forces and complicit action with them\nagainst fellow countrymen are inevitably destined to\nlead to mistrust and confrontation in inter-Korean\nrelations.\nWe are firmly convinced that we can resolve all\nproblems in the interests of the Korean nation by\ntranscending the differences in ideologies and systems\nexisting between the North and the South, if the North\nand the South sit together in the spirit of national\nindependence and the love of country and people.\nThe Democratic People's Republic of Korea will,\nin the future, make every effort to achieve independent\nreunification through a federation system that unites\nthe strength of the entire Korean nation in the spirit of\nthe North-South Joint Declaration.\nIn order to ensure peace and security on the\nKorean peninsula and realize reunification, the hostile\npolicy of the United States against the Democratic\nPeople's Republic of Korea should be terminated.\nThe United States defines the Democratic\nPeople's Republic of Korea as its prime enemy' that\nposes a threat' to it. It also designates us as the axis\nof evil' and target of a pre-emptive nuclear strike' on\nthe pretext of anti-terrorism,' thus further aggravating\nthe situation.\nIt is quite unreasonable that the United States\nantagonizes and threatens us with the use of force for\nthe sole reason that the Democratic People's Republic\nof Korea firmly adheres to an independent policy and\nholds different values and ideas. This also contravenes\nthe United Nations Charter and the norms of\ninternational relations. It is entirely as a result of the\nconsistent peace-loving policy and efforts of the\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea that peace is\nmaintained on the Korean peninsula.\nOur position on relations between the Democratic\nPeople's Republic of Korea and the United States is\never principled and consistent. If the United States\nrespects our system and sovereignty and takes an\nattitude of goodwill towards us, we can develop\nrelations with the United States based on the principles\nof equality and mutual benefit. The Democratic\nPeople's Republic of Korea considers that it is most\nreasonable to solve pending issues between itself and\nthe United States through dialogue and negotiations.\nWe had therefore already agreed to the United\nStates suggestion that it send a special envoy with a\nview to presenting its position on the resumption of\ndialogue. Furthermore, during the conversation\nbetween our Foreign Minister and United States\nSecretary of State at the 9th meeting of the Association\nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum\nin July, we again welcomed the United States\nwillingness to send its special envoy to Pyongyang.\nThe point is that trustful dialogue can be resumed\nonly when the United States refrains from its hostile\npolicy against the Democratic People's Republic of\nKorea and maintains a position of equality with us.\nIf the United States intends to have a substantial\ndialogue with us on the principle of sovereign equality,\nwe will respond accordingly. This will facilitate\nconfidence-building between the Democratic People's\nRepublic of Korea and the United States and open up\nthe prospect for hammering out a fair solution to the\npending issues.\nThe United Nations should also do its due part for\nthe peace and security of Korea. In this regard, I wish\nto remind you that immeasurable suffering and\nmisfortune were imposed on the Korean peninsula\nunder the name and flag of the United Nations. It is\nhighly expected that the United Nations will soon seek\nto redress the abnormal circumstances under which its\nname has been misused for over 50 years.\nWe take pride in contributing positively to peace\nand security on the Korean peninsula, the Northeast\nAsian region and the world in general, even under the\nconstant threats and confrontations that have persisted\nfor more than 50 years.\nOur great leader, General Kim Jong Il, leads our\npeople wisely with his army-based policies aimed at\ndefending the country, building a powerful nation and\nproviding for a favourable environment for peace and\nreunification in Korea, thanks to his energetic and\nuntiring external activities.\nThe respected General Kim Jong Il had a meeting\nwith President Putin in the Far East region of the\nRussian Federation in August this year, and is holding\ntalks with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan\nin Pyongyang today, 17 September. These contacts\nserve as turning points in the development of relations\n30\n\nbetween the Democratic People's Republic of Korea\nand Russia, the normalization of relations between the\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea and Japan, and\nalso serve as a great contribution to world peace,\nsecurity and the creation of a new and just world\nstructure.\nOur people will, in the future, firmly defend our\nsocialist system and achieve peace and the\nreunification of the Korean peninsula under the\noutstanding army-based leadership of the respected\nGeneral Kim Jong Il, thus fulfilling our mission for\npeace and security in the world.\nRadical changes have taken place in the\ninternational arena since the 11 September incident.'\nAttempts to expand the war against terrorism' without\njustifiable reasons continue and the policy of power\nsupremacy has emerged, openly advocating a theory of\npre-emptive nuclear attack beyond the doctrine of\nnuclear deterrence, thus further challenging world\npeace and security.\nHunger, poverty and external debts have become\nworse, while the inequality in international economic\nand trade relations and the gap between the rich and the\npoor have widened further. All these actions and events\nin international relations entirely contravene the spirit\nof the United Nations Charter.\nMy delegation considers that the most pressing\ntask before United Nations Members today is to respect\nand uphold the spirit enshrined in the United Nations\nCharter. Above all, the sovereignty and equality of all\ncountries should be respected. The use of force, the\napplication of coercive measures and, in particular,\nunilateral acts should not be allowed in international\nrelations.\nTo this end, the power of the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly should be decisively enhanced. The\nGeneral Assembly should be empowered to review the\nissues concerning international peace and security and\nto approve major decisions of the Security Council in\nthis regard. At present, the General Assembly is not\neven properly carrying out its intrinsic power as\nstipulated in the United Nations Charter.\nInternational issues, such as conflict resolution,\ndisarmament, terrorism and sustainable development,\nshould be discussed and decided with the full\nparticipation of all United Nations Members, in\nconformity with the purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations.\nIt is also important that democracy and\nimpartiality be ensured in all United Nations activities\nand the work of reforming the Security Council, in\nparticular, is undertaken to make it true to its main\npurpose. The Security Council should be reformed in\nsuch a way as to properly reflect present reality, where\nalmost all countries have become United Nations\nMembers, and fully ensure impartiality and democracy.\nIn order to achieve the purposes of the United\nNations, fair international economic and trade relations\nshould be established and the right to development\nrespected. Unless the present unfair international\neconomic system is redressed, poverty cannot be\neliminated, nor can the gap between the rich and the\npoor be removed, nor sustainable development for all\nbe ensured.\nThe Democratic People's Republic of Korea will,\nas ever, make all efforts to uphold and achieve the\npurposes and principles of the United Nations on the\nbasis of the ideas of independence, peace and\nfriendship.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn an imperfect\nworld, our citizens need the United Nations as they\nhave never needed it before. The United Nations has\nnot resolved all conflicts by peaceful means, nor could\nit. The authority of the United Nations has to be\nunderpinned by the force of arms. But the remarkable\nachievement of this body has been to make the fine\nlanguage of its Charter a force for good beyond just\nwords; by this the United Nations has raised the bar\nagainst the illegitimate use of violence, by States and\nnow by terrorists. In doing so, the United Nations has\nsaved lives by the million and saved millions more\nfrom fear, poverty and tyranny.\nWithout the United Nations, there could have\nbeen no salvation for the people of East Timor, no\nprospect of lasting peace in Sierra Leone, no one to\nhelp rebuild Afghanistan. Forty years ago, President\nJohn F. Kennedy predicted a world in which 25 States\nwould have nuclear weapons. But the Non-\nProliferation Treaty, supported by international\nsafeguards, has ensured that this nightmare scenario\nhas failed to materialize.\nAll this should serve to remind us of the critical\nrole which the United Nations has to play in world\naffairs, under its excellent Secretary-General, Kofi\nAnnan. It is the responsibility of all of us here in the\nAssembly to ensure that the legitimacy, the authority\nand the capacity of the United Nations to preserve\npeace and to help build prosperity is strengthened and\nnot undermined.\nToday, alongside the traditional threats to global\npeace and security, the United Nations and the world\ncommunity face three rising challenges: failing States,\nterrorism and weapons of mass destruction.\nThe world saw in Afghanistan the graphic\ndangers of State failure, where order breaks down, law\nis undermined and anarchy takes over. We in the\ninternational community must accept our share of the\nblame for allowing that country to disintegrate. Al\nQaeda and their evil creed were only too willing to take\nadvantage. But we delude ourselves if we believe that\nthe chaos in Afghanistan over much of the last decade\nis unique. In too many areas of the world, our fellow\ncitizens are forced to live under the rule of gangs,\nwithout the security and freedoms which we all should\nbe able to take for granted.\nIf we are serious about the concept of an\ninternational community, then, as Members of the\nUnited Nations, we must accept our responsibility to\nhelp prevent States from failing and to restore order\nwhere States have already collapsed.\nThe United Kingdom's own experience in\nAfghanistan, as the International Security Assistance\n12\n\nForce (ISAF) lead nation, working with the United\nNations, shows what can be done; but we all know that\nmuch more needs to be done. We need a much more\nstructured and methodical approach to this growing\nproblem of failed and failing States.\nBut the tools are there. At Monterrey in March\nand at Johannesburg earlier this month, the world\ncommunity has built on the Millennium Development\nGoals to reduce poverty among the world's most\ndisadvantaged people. We are backing this commitment\nwith action. Between 1996 and 2006 the United\nKingdom will have doubled its development assistance.\nTogether with the Doha Round of the World\nTrade Organization (WTO), we have within our grasp a\nnew era of sustainable economic growth and prosperity,\na stable political future for the developing world and a\nmuch more secure global environment.\nBut people cannot be freed from poverty unless\nthey are also free from fear. Security is not an option; it\nis a necessity. Three years ago over half of Sierra\nLeone was under the control of rebels; over half the\npopulation was displaced; countless civilians had been\nmurdered, abducted or horribly mutilated; a spiral of\nsickness and hunger was taking over. Now, thanks to\nUnited Nations and British intervention to end that\ndecade-long civil war, people are returning home and\nrebuilding their shattered lives. But long-term\ncommitment is necessary in situations like that.\nAs we found in Afghanistan, when we deal with\nfailing States, we have to tackle the second challenge\nto international law and justice \u2014 that of global\nterrorism \u2014 as well.\nAll the nations of the world, and all its people \u2014\nblack, white, Buddhist, Christian, Jew, Muslim, Hindu\nand Sikh \u2014 have a common interest in defeating\nterrorism. There must be no hiding places for terrorism\nor for terrorists; no hiding places for their money; and\nno semantic hiding places either. The distinction some\nclaim between terrorists and freedom-fighters is false\nand dangerous. Their victims enjoy no such distinction.\nThere must be no such distinctions either in\ninternational law.\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) created\nnew obligations on all of us. The United Kingdom has\nbeen honoured to chair the Counter-Terrorism\nCommittee. There has been an overwhelmingly\npositive response. But, as we recall those who lost their\nlives on 11 September last year, we cannot relax our\ncollective determination.\nAlongside the threats from failing States and\nfrom terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction poses the greatest current threat to global\nsecurity, and nowhere is the case for universal support\nfor the enforcement of United Nations law stronger\nthan in the field of weapons of mass destruction.\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons, the Chemical Weapons Convention and the\nBiological and Toxin Weapons Convention comprise\none of the world's most significant bodies of\ninternational law. For the past three decades, this\ncorpus of law has ensured \u2014 with one infamous\nexception \u2014 that no States have resorted to these, the\nworld's worst weapons.\nThat exception is Iraq. For two decades, Saddam\nHussein's regime has defied and frustrated every\nattempt to enforce the international rule of law. Iraq is\nthe only country to be condemned by the United\nNations for breaching the Convention on Chemical\nWeapons. Iraq has fought wars of aggression against\ntwo neighbours, and has launched missile attacks\nagainst five countries in the region. Iraq has used\npoison gas against its own people. Saddam Hussein has\npersistently mocked the authority of the United\nNations. No country has deceived every other country\nin the world as systematically and cynically as Iraq.\nAnd no country presents as fundamental a challenge to\nthe United Nations as Iraq.\nEvery society, from the smallest village to the\nglobal community represented here in the General\nAssembly, must have rules, and every member of that\ncommunity must accept responsibility for respecting\nand maintaining those rules. Without this, the very\nconcept of community breaks down. So those of us\nwho believe in an active international community\ncannot stand by and do nothing while Iraq continues to\ndefy the will of the United Nations. All of us who\nbelieve in the United Nations have to make up our\nminds now about how to deal with Iraq. The authority\nof the United Nations itself is at stake.\nWe cannot let Iraq do grave damage to this\nOrganization and the international order which it\nrepresents. We cannot let Iraq go on defying a decade\nof Security Council resolutions. If we do, we will find\nthat our resolutions are dismissed by aggressors\neverywhere as mere words. We have spent 57 years\n13\n\nbuilding this Organization beyond a talking shop. We\ncannot now let that work be undone.\nThere are times when hard choices have to be\nmade. On Iraq, we have now reached such a moment. If\nwe fail to deal with this challenge, the United Nations\nitself will be seriously weakened. And that would make\nthe world a much more dangerous place.\nAs President Bush spelled out in his powerful\nspeech to the Assembly here on Thursday, we have to\nbe resolute in the face of Iraq's defiance and secure the\nwill of the United Nations. We must require Iraq to re-\nadmit inspectors, with unfettered access. We have not\njust an interest but a responsibility to ensure that Iraq\ncomplies fully with international law. We have to be\nclear to Iraq and to ourselves about the consequences\nwhich will flow from a failure by Iraq to meet its\nobligations.\nAnd yes, in dealing with the threat posed by Iraq\nwe must also tackle those other international\nchallenges outlined so eloquently by Kofi Annan in his\naddress.\nOver the past year we have seen a further\ndeterioration in security in Israel and in the occupied\nterritories. There has never been a greater need for\ninternational involvement in the Middle East peace\nprocess to secure the outcome we all want to see: two\nStates, Israel and Palestine living side by side within\nsecure and recognized borders, based on Security\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 1397\n(2002).\nIn Kashmir, we should continue to urge both\nIndia and Pakistan to act with restraint, and to seek to\nresolve that long-running conflict.\nAt the end of the cold war we had all hoped that\nfuture generations would be able to enjoy a world\nwhere cooperation rather than conflict was the\nhallmark of international affairs. That goal is still\nwithin reach, if we are united in tackling State failure,\nin the war against terrorism and in confronting those\nthreats of weapons of mass destruction.\nThe tasks facing the founders of this institution\nwere no less intimidating. Yet their combination of\nhigh values and hard-headed realism created the\ngreatest instrument in history for the avoidance of war.\nOur founders' achievement has been formidable. But\nthe Organization now faces new and emerging threats.\nWe have to confront those threats and be ever alive to\nthe challenges which are out there to peace and justice\nacross the world. All of us who believe in those\nprinciples of international law and justice have a duty\nto ensure that they are both upheld and enforced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Your vast\npolitical experience and diplomatic skills guarantee the\nsuccessful discharge of your duties, on behalf of the\nUnited Nations cause and for the prestige of the\nfriendly Czech Republic.\nThe events of the past year do not allow us to\ntreat this session merely as a routine one; they give a\nmore specific nature. It should go beyond the routine\npolitical declarations and should aim at achieving\nspecific results. This session should address the\nunfinished tasks of the Millennium Declaration and the\nnew challenges to international peace and security,\nprimarily the fight against terrorism. The session\nshould contribute to resolving the persistent problems\n17\n\nof underdevelopment, poverty and widespread disease\nthroughout the world.\nUnfortunately, regional crises and conflicts in\ndifferent parts of the world continue to dominate the\nGeneral Assembly agenda. Bulgaria has been closely\nfollowing the situation in the Middle East, and it\nsupports efforts to find fair and lasting solutions. We\nshare the view that progress can be achieved only on\nthe basis of dialogue and cooperation between the\nparties concerned and with the active engagement of\nthe \u201cquartet\u201d in this process.\nThe situation in Afghanistan is still volatile. The\nGovernment needs comprehensive support to enhance\ninternal stability and security and to rebuild the\ncountry. Therefore, Bulgaria has suggested that the\nexternal debt of Afghanistan be relieved in order to\nstimulate economic development of that country.\nIraq has been of a focus of attention of the United\nNations for the past 12 years. The full implementation\nof Security Council resolutions concerning Iraq is of\nurgent importance. We expect Iraq to comply\nimmediately and unconditionally with those\nresolutions. For its part, the Council must take actions\nthat will uphold its authority and credibility as the\nsingle international body responsible for the\nmaintenance of world peace and security. I concur with\nthe views expressed thus far by Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan, President Bush and other previous speakers\nabout the need to act decisively and without delay to\nadopt an effective, workable Security Council position\non this issue.\nBulgaria has come to the fifty-seventh session of\nthe General Assembly with the added responsibility of\na member of the Security Council. We are strongly\ncommitted to the principles of consensus, constructive\ndialogue and transparency in the work of the Council.\nThe fight against terrorism is a top international\npriority today. Yesterday's special meeting of the\nSecurity Council reaffirmed the validity of resolution\n1373 (2001) and commended the work of the Counter-\nTerrorism Committee. The presidential statement,\nsupported unanimously by the Council, reflects the\npolitical will for common action against terrorism in all\nits forms and manifestations. I would add that the fight\nagainst terrorism should not lead to persecution on\nreligious or ethnic grounds nor infringe upon human\nrights.\nBulgaria is already a party to all international\nconventions against terrorism. Moreover, my country\nhas made a substantial contribution to all international\nefforts by sending its contingent to Afghanistan.\nAnti-terrorist efforts require a serious rethinking\nof current approaches to cooperation. We are aware\nthat terrorism is often linked to other security threats,\nsuch as organized crime, drug trafficking, corruption,\nmoney-laundering and the illegal arms trade. Bulgaria\nhas initiated and actively participated in a number of\nbilateral and regional cooperation arrangements on\nthese issues. My country is increasingly effective in\nblocking one of the routes of drug trafficking towards\nEurope. We have adopted one of the most stringent\nlaws on export controls over the arms trade and have\nbeen implementing a whole range of its provisions\ndecisively.\nDevelopments in South-Eastern Europe remain\ndynamic and volatile. Yet, for the first time in recent\nyears it has been positive. I, for one, am optimistic that\nthe legacy of conflict and confrontation could be\nsurmounted at long last, and stability, peace and\nsecurity can finally be established in the region. This\nprocess should be continued and made irreversible. All\ncountries in South-Eastern Europe today share the\nsame European perspective, and this is what gives me\ngrounds for optimism. For Bulgaria, early membership\nin the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) is a strategic priority enjoying\nwide public support.\nDuring the years of crisis and post-crisis\nmanagement in South-Eastern Europe, Bulgaria has\nshown the capacity and proved its ability to generate\nstability and security in the region. It continues to\npromote the effective and strict implementation of the\nChemical Weapons and Biological Weapons\nConventions. The uncontrolled proliferation of small\narms is another source of terrorism. Furthermore, we\nstrongly support the United Nations Programme of\nAction in this sphere.\nInternational human rights protection should take\nplace in the spirit of justice and equality, in line with\nthe United Nations Charter and the principles of\ninternational law. The United Nations should be in a\nposition to respond promptly and more effectively to\nany serious human rights violations. This is why we\nsupport the ongoing reforms in the monitoring\nmechanisms of the Commission on Human Rights.\n18\n\nBulgaria believes that the internal security of any\nState lies in the exercise of all human rights by persons\nbelonging to minorities within the State and is closely\nlinked to the internal stability of that State. All\nindividuals should enjoy their rights on the basis of\nnon-discrimination and equality before the law. In this\nregard, we insist that the international community's\nefforts should be focused primarily on the\nimplementation of existing standards.\nDecisions should be taken to make the United\nNations more effective in fulfilling its numerous\nresponsibilities. Bulgaria supports the reform measures\ninitiated by Secretary-General Kofi Annan. United\nNations reform must continue and take into account in\nfuture the new political and economic realities. In\nparticular, it must address the specific issues of\nsustainable development. I emphasize this point,\nbecause I am still under the influence of the\nJohannesburg World Summit, where my country once\nagain confirmed its strong support to efforts targeted at\nthe eradication of poverty and achieving sustainable\npatterns of production and consumption, as well as\nproviding decent health care and education to the\nEarth's population.\nMr. President, I would like to assure you that\nBulgaria regard the work of the United Nations with a\ngreat sense of responsibility. We stand ready to\nparticipate in the discussions and decision-making on\nall agenda items. The world today needs resoluteness\nand firmness in order to meet the new challenges to\ninternational peace, security and sustainable\ndevelopment. The United Nations offers the best\nframework for tackling these challenges. Bulgaria is\nwilling and able to make its contribution to such\ninternational efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, I would like to thank the\noutgoing President of the General Assembly, Mr. Han\nSeung-soo, for the superb manner in which he led the\nwork of the fifty-sixth session of the Assembly.\nPermit me, Sir, to congratulate you on your\nelection to the presidency of the fifty-seventh session\nof the General Assembly, and to express my best\nwishes for success in your work at the head of this\nimportant body. It is with enormous satisfaction that,\non behalf of the President of the Republic of Guinea-\nBissau, Mr. Kumba Yal\u00e1, we welcome Switzerland as a\nMember of the United Nations. We also look forward\nto welcoming the Republic of Timor-Leste, a member\nof our community of Portuguese-speaking countries.\nThe loss of human lives can never be justified by\na cause, no matter what its noble goals. Just a year ago,\nthe people of Guinea-Bissau joined their voices to\nthose of the international community in condemning all\nacts of terrorism and all actions which would threaten\ninternational security.\nWe are convinced of the lofty ideals of\ndemocracy, in which human security becomes the pillar\nof society's development. Therefore, on my own\naccount and on behalf of the people of Guinea-Bissau,\nI condemn the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001,\nand we reiterate our conviction that the only way in\nwhich to combat such infamy is to unite all our efforts\nunder the auspices of the United Nations.\nOur readiness to cooperate in the quest for\nsolutions that will guarantee peace and stability in our\nsubregion is great, although the internal conflicts in\nneighbouring countries inevitably entail costs in the\ndefence and security areas. They also compel us to\nsacrifice the meagre budgets of priority sectors of the\nGovernment's programme, such as health and\neducation.\nThe progressive establishment of democracy,\nhuman rights, international cooperation and\ndevelopment will restore the dignity of our people.\nConvinced of this, we are developing partnerships with\nthe United Nations system to combat poverty in\nGuinea-Bissau. We continue to make sacrifices to pave\nthe way for development. These sacrifices include\ninterruptions in the normal course of development in a\nState where the 1998 conflict bore witness to the evils\nof a people's poverty, and to the destruction of the\n16\n\nprecarious structures of a new State in a region where\nthere are pockets of conflict that tend to cross borders,\nand thus to increase the climate of instability.\nThe Senegalese conflict, in the Casamance\nregion, provides an example of our resolve to help find\nconsensus solutions to put an end to many years of\narmed conflict in the neighbouring Republic of\nSenegal. Respect for the Charter of the Organization of\nAfrican Unity as it relates to the retention of the\nborders inherited from colonialism calls for Guinea-\nBissau's participation in efforts to establish peace and\nstability in a united and indivisible Senegal.\nBased on this conviction, our country supports\nthe efforts of the People's Republic of China towards\npeaceful reunification, under the theme of \u201cone nation,\ntwo systems.\u201d\nThe economic and financial difficulties faced by\nthe Government of Guinea-Bissau have been the object\nof attention by the members of the Security Council. It\nis clear that peacekeeping efforts cannot be divorced\nfrom the need to preserve economic and social stability\nin Guinea-Bissau. Thus, progress on peacekeeping, on\neconomic recovery and on development in Guinea-\nBissau are interdependent.\nGuinea-Bissau, a member of the African Union,\nis involved in the struggle for peace, stability,\ndemocracy, the defence of human rights, cooperation,\ndevelopment, prosperity and human dignity. We are\nbound, furthermore, by our national poverty reduction\nstrategy to contribute to the socio-economic\nprogramme to revitalize our continent, following the\nbroader approach of the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment (NEPAD).\nIt is clear to Guinea-Bissau that the United\nNations, as a forum for dealing with questions related\nto world peace, respect for human rights, the\neradication of poverty and the promotion of sustainable\ndevelopment worldwide, is encouraging and\ncontributing in practical ways to the success of NEPAD\nand to ensuring that the commitments entered into in\nDoha, Monterrey and Johannesburg will be effectively\nimplemented.\nGuinea-Bissau remains committed to finding\nsolutions to its difficult socio-economic situation, and\nappeals to the international community to contribute to\nthe implementation of our national poverty reduction\nstrategy.\nI would like to recognize the intelligent, patriotic\nmanner in which Angola put an end to long years of\nconflict, as well as the progress made towards the\nresolution of the conflicts in Senegal, the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, Burundi and the Comoros.\nDialogue is the best instrument for restoring\npeace and working towards stability and development\nfor humanity. That is why we encourage the actors in\nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict to join in the effort to\nfind acceptable solutions to bring about concrete\nsecurity and prosperity for both peoples. Strict\ncompliance with Security Council resolutions 242\n(1967), 338 (1973) and 1397 (2002) will be the only\nresponse acceptable to the Assembly and the only proof\nthat the parties recognize the incalculable value of our\nOrganization.\nTo realize the promises contained in the\nMillennium Declaration and in the United Nations\nCharter, which would guarantee a more prosperous and\njust world, we join in the appeal made to the leaders of\nIraq to abide by Security Council resolutions with\nrespect to Chapter VII of the Charter, in order to avoid\na possible Council decision.\nGuinea-Bissau shares the need for broader and\nmore effective participation in the work of the Security\nCouncil, which is a vital organ of the Organization.\nPermit me to recall that reducing poverty in the\npoorest countries, such as ours, will guarantee the\nprosperity, stability, peace and security of the entire\nworld and is the best way to neutralize terrorism.\nWe speak out in the struggle against the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and for\nthe creation of conditions which will allow access to\nbasic resources such as water, to education and to the\nprotein necessary for healthy growth.\nSolidarity among peoples is and will continue to\nbe the guarantee that we will be able to bequeath to\nfuture generations the legacy of a prosperous world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, Sir, please allow me to offer my warmest\ncongratulations on your assumption of the presidency\nof the current session of the General Assembly. I wish\nalso to express my gratitude to Mr. Han Seung-soo,\nPresident of the previous session of the Assembly.\nI wish to congratulate the Swiss Confederation on\nhaving joined the United Nations and also to welcome\nthe Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, which will\nsoon become a Member of the Organization.\nThe opening of this session coincides with the\nfirst anniversary of the events of 11 September. Over\nthe past year, the international campaign against\nterrorism has made headway, and now we should not\nonly ponder ways to eradicate the global scourge of\nterrorism, but also take a broader view of the security\nissues facing humankind and seek to achieve lasting\npeace and universal security.\nAt present, the international security situation is\nundergoing profound changes. Security has begun to\ntake on wider connotations. While traditional military\nantagonism and conflicts have yet to be eliminated, a\nvariety of non-traditional security concerns have\nbecome increasingly prominent. Security is no longer a\npurely military concern. It has permeated politics,\neconomics, finance, science, technology, culture and\nmany other areas.\nSecurity is no longer a zero-sum game. Its\nmutuality is obviously on the increase, as countries\nhave come to realize that they have common security\ninterests and feel a greater sense of interdependence.\nWe must overhaul the tools at our disposal to\nachieve security. Military means alone have proved\ninadequate in meeting the massive and complex\nsecurity challenges facing us. The indiscriminate use of\nforce can only lead to greater trouble in our world.\nThis new situation calls for new ideas in the area\nof safeguarding security. We in China believe in a new\nsecurity concept that features mutual trust, mutual\nbenefit, equality and cooperation.\nBy mutual trust, we mean that countries should\nrise above their differing ideologies and social systems,\nabandon the cold-war mentality and the power politics\nmindset, and refrain from harbouring suspicion and\nhostility towards each other. They should hold frequent\ndialogues and mutual briefings on their security and\ndefence policies or on the major actions they are about\nto take.\nBy mutual benefit, we mean that a country should\nrespect the security interests of others while pursuing\nits own, and also help to create conditions for\nenhancing the security of others while making itself\nmore secure  thus achieving universal security.\nBy equality, we mean that all countries  large\nor small, strong or weak  should respect each other,\ntreat each other as equals and refrain from interfering\nin each other's internal affairs, so that international\nrelations can become more democratized.\nBy cooperation, we mean that countries should\nresolve their disputes through peaceful negotiations,\nengage in extensive and close cooperation on their\nshared security concerns and work to prevent wars and\nconflicts.\nAll in all, our new security concept is aimed at\nincreasing mutual trust through dialogue and at\npromoting common security through cooperation.\nIt is in the spirit of this new security concept that\nwe in China have been working hard to promote\nmechanisms for a regional security dialogue and\ncooperation, actively participating in the Shanghai\nCooperation Organization and in the Association of\nSouth-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum,\nand endeavouring to establish an Asia-Pacific security\nframework that is for dialogue and against\nconfrontation.\nChina is actively committed to international arms\ncontrol, disarmament and the non-proliferation process.\nNot long ago, the Chinese Government promulgated\nthe Regulations on Export Controls of Missiles and\nRelated Items and Technologies and its Control List.\nThe Chinese Government will make further\nimprovements on its export-management mechanisms\nfor biological and chemical dual-use items. We call on\nthe international community actively to undertake\ndialogue and cooperation in the spirit of this new\nsecurity concept, in a joint effort to tackle the major\nsecurity concerns of the day.\nWe should press ahead with international\ncooperation against terrorism and curb the threat of\ninternational terrorism once and for all.\nCounter-terrorism should be pursued on the basis\nof international law and of the norms governing\n16\n\ninternational relations, allowing the United Nations and\nits Security Council to play a leading role. It should\ntake a comprehensive approach, with a focus on\neliminating the root causes of terrorism. Efforts should\nbe made to prevent the arbitrary enlargement of the\nscope of the counter-terrorism campaign, but proven\nterrorists, including the East Turkestan terrorist\nforces  trained, armed and bankrolled by the Taliban\nand Al Qaeda  must be resolutely stamped out.\nWe should step up dialogue and reconciliation\nprocesses and facilitate the settlement of regional hot-\nspot issues.\nChina supports the Palestinian people and their\njust cause to regain their legitimate national rights and\nto establish their own State. We support the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions and the principle of land\nfor peace. We are opposed to violence targeting\ninnocent civilians, and we reject responding to violence\nwith violence.\nWe stand for a political settlement of the question\nof Iraq. The United Nations should play an important\nrole in this regard. Iraq should implement the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions in a faithful and strict\nmanner.\nWe hope that India and Pakistan will soon resume\ndialogue on the basis of equality and mutual respect\nand resolve all their differences, including that over\nKashmir, through peaceful means.\nWe will continue to work constructively for a\nlasting peace in Afghanistan and its post-war\nrehabilitation. We support the important role of the\nUnited Nations in this regard.\nWe should strengthen exchanges and dialogues\namong different civilizations and thereby avert conflict\nor confrontation. Differences among diverse\ncivilizations are a basic characteristic of humanity.\nWe have every reason to treat the achievements of\nvarious civilizations kindly and to promote exchanges\namong them on the basis of respect for diversity.\nEveryone is encouraged to draw upon the strength of\nothers with a view to realizing common development.\nPeace and development go hand in hand. Many of\nthe problems we face today may be development-\nrelated. In coping with these challenges, it is all the\nmore important to look to development for answers. In\nthe past year, the United Nations has held a series of\nimportant meetings on development such as the World\nSummit on Sustainable Development. What is needed,\nright now, is to translate the programmes and\ncommitments into reality.\nIn the past year, regional economic cooperation\nhas continued to move forward. We feel especially\nhappy about the launching of the African Union,\nconvinced that Africa will now take fresh strides on the\nroad to development. At present, our development\ntasks have become more pressing. The widening wealth\ngap in the world must be reversed. Frequent economic\nand social shocks must be dealt with. The sharpening\nclashes between economic development, on the one\nhand, and resources and the environment, on the other,\nmust be allayed. The international order and the rules\nof the game, which do not fairly reflect the needs of\ndeveloping countries, must be changed.\nWe would like to make the following\npropositions. First, to establish a global partnership\ngeared to development. Governments, international\norganizations, transnational corporations and non-\ngovernmental groups are all parties to the cause of\ndevelopment. The North and the South, the aid-\nrecipient countries and international aid institutions,\nshould be equal and cooperative partners in dealing\nwith the global economic slowdown. The developed\ncountries ought to lend developing countries a helping\nhand. The new round of multilateral trade talks should\nbe seized as an important opportunity for forging such\na new partnership.\nSecondly, to promote a balanced and steady\ndevelopment in the context of economic globalization.\nThe international community needs to reform current\nroles in the world economy, strengthen guidance and\nmanagement of the globalization process and promote\na win-win situation and coexistence among countries.\nThirdly, to strengthen the developing countries'\ncapacity for self-development. Developing countries\nshould opt for a development path suited to them and\nstrive to catch up with the tide of global economic\ndevelopment. The international community should\nrespect the right of developing countries to\nindependently choose a development path, and help\nthem with capacity-building.\nFourthly, in order to continue on the path of\nsustainable development, we should promote a\nbalanced development of the economy, population,\nresources and the environment. Efforts to address the\n17\n\nenvironmental problems of individual countries should\nbe combined with those aimed at global concerns.\nFifthly, to enhance comprehensive development of the\npeople. Human resources are the primary resources for\nadvancing science and technology and for realizing\neconomic and social development. In formulating\ndevelopment strategies, countries should make the\npeople their top priority and main beneficiary.\nThe Communist Party of China will soon hold its\nsixteenth national Congress, the very first in the new\ncentury. Standing in the forefront of the historical tide\nand displaying a spirit of progressing with the times,\nthis party Congress will draw up a new blueprint for\naccelerating socialist modernization in China. Our\nguiding thought is to consistently represent the\ndevelopment requirements of China's advanced\nproductive forces, represent the orientation of China's\nadvanced culture and represent the fundamental\ninterests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese\npeople. Our historic mission is to accelerate the drive\nfor modernization, complete the reunification of the\nmotherland, maintain world peace and promote\ncommon development.\nThe first 10 to 20 years of this century present\nChina with an important strategic window of\nopportunity for its development. While taking\ndevelopment as our number one priority, we must grasp\nthe opportunities, deepen reform, open the country still\nwider to the outside world, promote development and\nmaintain stability.\nWe will continue to pursue an independent\nforeign policy of peace, actively develop friendly\nrelations in cooperation with all countries in the world\non the basis of the five principles of peaceful\ncoexistence, and facilitate international dialogue and\ncooperation, thus contributing constructively to a fairer\nand more equitable international order.\nThere is but one China in the world. Both the\nmainland and Taiwan belong to that one China, and\nChina's sovereignty and territorial integrity brook no\ndivision. The Chinese Government adheres to the basic\npolicy of peaceful reunification and one country, two\nsystems; and President Jiang Zemin's eight point\nproposal on how to develop cross-strait' relations and\npromote a peaceful reunification of the motherland for\nthe current stage. We are firm in our opposition to all\nforms of Taiwanese independence activities and will\ntolerate no attempt to separate Taiwan from the rest of\nChina in any fashion. All acts of Taiwan independence\nare doomed to failure and our grand cause of national\nreunification will triumph.\n\n\n"

We must\nstrengthen our common bond and work together to try\nto find solutions to the problems that affect us all.\nWe, the poor countries, are asked to practise\nausterity and fiscal discipline, respect the rules of the\n2\n\nfree market and free trade and cooperate in the fight\nagainst the scourges that afflict humankind. When we\ntry to obtain access to the major markets for our goods,\nhowever, the door is slammed shut. We are asked to be\ncompetitive, but when we take the fruits of our labour\nto the market, subsidies amounting to millions of\ndollars are placed in our way, making it impossible for\nus to even hope to compete.\nWe are asked to participate in the fight against\ndrug trafficking, but we have not been given the\nresources promised us to enable us to carry out our\naction plans.\nWhen we try to negotiate in a serious and creative\nway with international lending agencies, attempts are\nmade to impose terms on us \u2014 terms that, if accepted,\nwould dangerously weaken our young and sometimes\nfragile democracies.\nPeople don't understand: our peoples, in their\npoverty, are quite perceptive, but they still cannot\nunderstand how they can benefit from a globalization\nprocess that may never knock at their doors.\nWe, the leaders of the developing countries, are\nseverely criticized when, upon our return from summits\nand forums, we have only meagre results to show, and\nwhen the resolve to provide support and cooperation is\nweakened because of the actions of a few with respect\nto a consensus declaration.\nI want to be very clear and simple in expressing\nmy thoughts in this universal forum: hypocrisy,\ninequity, injustice, increased poverty and failure to take\naction, among other ills, are the main reasons for\nbreaches of the peace. They create a framework in\nwhich violence, sectarian extremism and\nmisunderstanding find fertile ground.\nThe developed world has found new and\ndiscriminatory methods \u2014 in financial, social and\nethical terms \u2014 of categorizing our countries. Some\nare willing to perpetuate this perverse way of\ncategorizing us on the basis of criteria laid down by\nthose that have more than we do. We are criticized for\na lack of transparency and for some alleged lack of\nrespect for the law, while enormous losses are piling up\nowing to corruption. Could it be that the very\nfoundations of the capital system have been seriously\ndamaged by the scandals that have taken place in the\nwealthier and more powerful nations?\nOur emigrants are discriminated against, and\nsome forget how the most prosperous nations managed\nto create their identities through the mixing of races or\nby opening their arms to those yearning for progress\nand freedom. Developed countries demand the\nstrengthening of our institutions and they get quite\nlyrical in their support for democratic processes, which\noften take forms that lead only to instability. We must\nbreak paradigms, and we must do it now. We must not\npersist in simplifying, relying on a purely economic\nvocabulary, all the benefits of a globalization process\nthat is still not understood by all, nor assimilated in\neach of its components.\nWe speak of free flows of capitals, but these\nflows only take the form of transfers of investments in\nthe Northern Hemisphere. We countries in the Southern\nHemisphere have typically received these same capitals\nin the form of expensive loans, whose heavy burden it\nhas been impossible to alleviate over time.\nWhen the North looks to the South, it sees it with\npaternalistic and patronizing eyes. The widely\npublicized equity in the terms of exchange is only\nvisible in statements, manuals and textbooks of\ndeveloped countries. What we need is a new global\nethic, one that repudiates terrorism but helps, with the\nsame strength and resolve, give substance to our\ncreative efforts to eradicate poverty, a poverty that\nthreatens the most basic principles of human dignity.\nWhen food is lacking, when there is no health or\neducation, and when the survival instinct itself is\nlimited, very little or nothing can be done to pursue\nvalues and ideals cherished by any developed society.\nMy country condemns terrorism. My government\nsupports every effort to eradicate it, but Ecuador also\ndemands the creation of a new coalition and a new\norder to fight against poverty.\nThis is a new century, a century of solidarity and\nhope. But we must also make this century a century of\nrespect on the part of all nations for the principles that\ngovern international law. Yes, it is a new century, a\ncentury in which all activities that violate the sanctity\nof human life are condemned and prosecuted. There is\nno justification whatsoever for taking the lives of\ninnocent persons. We must work with all forces\navailable, together under the law, to fight this scourge.\nThis is also a century of changes of attitudes and\nof proposals, a time in which we must resolve\ndefinitively the problem of the debt of the poorest\n3\n\ncountries towards the developed countries. It must be a\ntime of opportunity to build a fairer world, a world of\nsolidarity.\nAs a global citizen, I am concerned that the\ncommitment to ensure the very existence of the planet\nis not shared equitably by all. Everything is demanded\nof those of us who have great diversity and renewable\nresources, but, in return, we are denied the financial\ntools to seek alternative resources for a development\nnot entailing the destruction of our natural resources, as\nif this commitment to the environment should fall on\nour shoulders alone. We must fight to improve the\nquality of life on earth. But the beneficiaries of this\nstruggle must be every man and woman on earth, and\nnot only those with the good fortune to have been born\nin the North.\nEcuador, which I am honoured to represent in this\nAssembly, is a country committed to the most noble\ncauses of the international community. No effort will\nbe spared to enable our people to reach a human\nsociety in which men, women and children, without\ndistinction, without exclusion, can develop fully and\nflourish.\nEcuador wants to be an ethical model that looks\nto the future. We wish to see the voice of reason heard\nin every global forum. We want to create a world of\nfreedom, a more just and united society. We would like,\nfrom the centre of the two hemispheres, to be a bridge\nuniting North and South, two regions that should walk\ntogether towards development and not be separated by\ngeographic conventions.\nThank you so much, distinguished delegates, for\nthis extraordinary opportunity to address the world\ncommunity. Thank you for your continuing efforts to\nmake the United Nations the highest forum of\ninternational debate. My country and my Government\nview this body as the highest forum for debate and for\nthe settlement of those problems that constantly affect\nhumankind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan, and through\nhim the Czech Republic, on his well-deserved election\nto preside over the work of this session of the General\nAssembly. Allow me also to congratulate Switzerland\non its recent admission to membership of the United\nNations and to congratulate the Republic of Timor-\nLeste on its imminent admission.\nFifty-eight years ago, the founders of the\nOrganization undertook to promote social progress and\nbetter standards of life in larger freedom.\nUnquestionably, the main purpose of the United\nNations is the promotion of justice and well-being for\nall. We must reaffirm that commitment today. We must\ndedicate ourselves to building a more just, free,\nharmonious and happy society. We must indeed draw\nthe maximum advantage from the benefits of joint\naction and cooperation in order to create a world of\nmutual advantage. As stated in the Millennium\nDeclaration, we have a collective responsibility to\nuphold the principles of human dignity and equality at\nthe global level.\nHowever, we are still very far from reaching that\ngoal. In the last 10 years, more than 3.5 million people\nhave died in civil wars. One billion three hundred and\neighty million people live in extreme poverty, and 854\nmillion do not know how to read or write. Democracy,\njustice and the enjoyment of civil and political rights\nare far from being universal. We believe that we need\nto address the miserable and alarming situation of the\nworld's children. More than 30,000 children die every\nday of diseases that are easily preventable. There are\nmore than 300,000 child soldiers in the world. More\nthan 150 million children suffer from malnutrition due\nto a lack of food, and many millions go without\nschooling. This situation is as serious as \u2014 or more\nserious than \u2014 the effects of terrorism, which are\nthemselves abominable. However, these problems do\nnot draw the public's attention and are relegated to a\nsecondary place on the world's agenda.\nWe have stopped half way in our struggle to\ncreate a better world. Many examples attest to this\nbitter fact. It is right for us to celebrate the holding of\nthe first elections after an armed conflict or the end of\na dictatorship. However, those are just the first steps\ndown the path of a democratic way of life. Unless the\nUnited Nations commits itself to ensuring the\nsustainability of democracy, elections, regardless of\ntheir inherent value, will not necessarily mean a victory\nin the fight for human rights. Democracy must be an\ninstrument for attaining equitable development and\ncreating favourable conditions for peoples who invest\ntheir hopes in it.\nThe sustainability of democracy can be\nsafeguarded though the promotion of the fundamental\nsocial values of dialogue, harmony and reconciliation.\nThat is also done by combating extreme poverty and\nthe growing economic gap between various social\ngroups, which are ills that weaken the social fabric and\nerode confidence in political institutions. Financial\n20\n\ncrises foster conditions favourable to the existence of\nextremist and opportunist groups seeking to overthrow\ndemocratic Governments. Greater international\ncooperation for development is necessary to\nconsolidate democracy. It is for that reason that we\nurgently call upon developed nations to implement the\nMonterrey Consensus, and in particular to fulfil their\ncommitment to increase official development\nassistance. Costa Rica fully supports United Nations\nefforts to promote and strengthen democracy. But we\nalso emphasize that the United Nations should not give\nany less attention to the creation of the economic and\nsocial conditions that will help to strengthen and\npreserve democratic institutions throughout the world.\nWe also believe that globalization, with its rapid\ndevelopment of information and communication\ntechnologies and growing economic and commercial\ninterdependence, offers us tremendous opportunities\nfor economic and social development. We must\ncertainly take advantage of those opportunities to\ncreate a better world for all. However, globalization\nalso poses serious dangers. Structural barriers,\nfinancial imbalances and the lack of capital for\nproductive and social investment can cause the\neconomic collapse of entire regions. Subsidies,\nrestricted access to international markets and capital\nflight distort free competition. Globalization may\nwiden the gap between the wealthiest and the poorest\nsectors of society. The digital divide may exclude the\nmost vulnerable from the benefits of the modern\neconomy and cast a long shadow over the futures of\nthose left behind. It is essential that we make greater\nefforts to protect the most vulnerable groups and\nnations.\nThe United Nations must call on the developed\ncountries to open their markets and to abolish\nsubsidies, thus enabling developing countries to have\naccess to the benefits of globalization. Thus, in\ncombating inequality and extreme poverty, we will\nbuild more equitable and just societies.\nHuman dignity has been championed ever since\nthe founding of the United Nations. Government\ncorruption, in all its forms and at all levels, is a\ngenuine breach of human rights. It is outrageous that\nunjust leaders should enrich themselves by corrupt\nmeans and thus impoverish their peoples. It is\nscandalous to see how certain rulers divert public funds\nto their private accounts while reducing their peoples to\nthe most appalling poverty. At the same time, the\nGovernments of some States Members of the United\nNations fuel corruption by granting tax deductions for\nbribes offered abroad. There are even some Member\nStates that protect corrupt leaders under the guise of\nbanking secrecy. The United Nations should forbid all\nsuch acts and prevent the granting of amnesty, asylum\nand travel visas to those who seek to evade justice.\nThe protection of human rights may be weakened\nwithout multilateral protection, monitoring and\nsanctions mechanisms. Costa Rica advocates the\ncreation of a new generation of human rights\nmechanisms to provide greater protection to all\nindividuals. This effort has already born its first fruit in\nthe form of a draft optional protocol to the Convention\nagainst Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading\nTreatment or Punishment. That legal instrument,\nrecently adopted by the Economic and Social Council,\nwill be submitted to the General Assembly for\nconsideration in the next few days. I urge all States\nactively to support the draft as a sign of their\nunequivocal commitment to human rights and to the\nprimacy of the dignity and integrity of all human\nbeings.\nWe welcome the recent entry into force of the\nRome Statute establishing the International Criminal\nCourt. Human kind at last has an effective, independent\nand impartial judicial organ with jurisdiction to try the\nmost serious crimes against human dignity. We must\nnot weaken it.\nWhile the United Nations upholds the principle of\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes, requiring just\nmeans and institutions to resolve differences, the\nInternational Court of Justice \u2014 the United Nations\nmain judicial organ and guarantor of international law,\nresponsible for ensuring the rule of law in international\nrelations and for preventing arbitrary and casuistic\ninterpretations of legal norms \u2014 has become a purely\nrhetorical device. Very few States Members of the\nUnited Nations have accepted its mandatory\njurisdiction without reservation, while others have\nmade the situation even worse by unjustifiably\nwithdrawing or modifying their acceptance of its\njurisdiction. Only 12 nations accept the mandatory\njurisdiction of the Court without reservation or\ncondition. To ignore the authority of the highest\njudicial organ of the society of nations is tantamount to\nclosing the door to justice and endangers the integrity\nof the international legal order.\n21\n\nWhat alternative is there for nations if they\ncannot rely on judicial bodies to settle their\ndifferences? The only alternative is force. It is essential\nfor all States Members of the United Nations to accept\nwithout condition the obligatory jurisdiction of the\nInternational Court of Justice. Only thus will we be\nable to create a more just, peaceful and secure world.\nA more just world will necessarily be more\npeaceful. Justice demands respect for others and for\ntheir freedom \u2014 in other words, tolerance. Peace in\nmany regions of the world is seriously threatened by\nintolerance. In the Middle East, the rights of the\npeoples of Israel and Palestine are being violated. The\nintolerance of one leader is today making a country\nlike Iraq the possible setting for endlessly bitter war.\nHow different the situation would be if it had a fair\nGovernment respectful of human rights. The world has\nalso witnessed with concern the growing dispute\nbetween India and Pakistan and the threat of nuclear\nwar in that region.\nMy country would like to see greater tolerance\nprevail in the Taiwan Straits. We hope to see a just\nsettlement that would fulfil the desires of the entire\nChinese people. Costa Rica has historically enjoyed\nand continues to enjoy close friendly relations with the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan. Creative agreements\nhave been reached in many international organizations\nto permit the participation of the Republic of China in\ntheir work. The world would be a far more peaceful\nplace if we were able to find an innovative accord to\nallow that country and its people to be represented with\ndignity in this and other international organizations.\nWhile it is a principle of the United Nations to\nprevent violence and to achieve lasting and stable\npeace, there are Governments that transfer weapons to\nrebel and terrorist groups and States Members of the\nUnited Nations that scorn efforts being made for\ndisarmament and the reduction of military expenditure.\nWe call for the adoption of a legally binding\nframework convention to regulate the arms trade. Our\nexperience as a disarmed nation has taught us that not\nspending on weapons is the best decision for those\ncountries that are truly committed to the well-being of\ntheir peoples.\nWe urge the nuclear States truly to commit\nthemselves to disarmament negotiations. We deem it\nnecessary to adopt a comprehensive convention to\nprohibit the use of nuclear weapons. In the meantime,\nall States must renounce the development of new\nnuclear weapons and ratify the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nWe cannot commit ourselves only half-way to\nhuman dignity, equality and justice. We must not allow\nour children, the future generation, to be able to\ncondemn us for doublespeak. If we can do that, we will\nbe making a true contribution to their inheritance of a\nbetter world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAs is the case every year, Burkina Faso is\nvery pleased to take part in the regular session of the\nGeneral Assembly, this great meeting of peoples united\nby the same destiny and motivated by the same ideal:\nto build a world of justice, love and peace. I am\nconvinced, Mr. President, that the choice of a person of\nyour great ability to preside over this fifty-seventh\nsession will help us greatly. As we congratulate you\nand the members of the Bureau on that special honour,\nmy delegation and I want to assure you of our full\navailability and cooperation for the success of your\nmission. We also want to express again our profound\nrecognition of your predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo,\nfor the competence with which he presided over the\nfifty-sixth session.\nThe quest for peace and security and the\npromotion of cooperation and development are the\nessential values that presided over the creation of the\nUnited Nations. Today, more than ever before, with the\ntragic events of 11 September 2001 \u2014 whose first\nanniversary we have just commemorated \u2014 those\nobjectives have assumed a more immediate and urgent\ncharacter, because world peace finds itself seriously\nthreatened, in particular by international terrorism. We\nmust all convince ourselves that the best response to\ninternational terrorism must proceed from collective\naction \u2014 in other words, from action by the entire\ninternational community.\nAs a member of that community, Burkina Faso \u2014\nwhich has made the quest for peace a creed \u2014\nreaffirms most solemnly, vigorously and\nunambiguously its condemnation of terrorism in all its\nforms, whatever the motivations. Our determination to\nfight alongside the United Nations against that danger\nis unwavering, and our implementation of Security\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) was the subject of a\nreport submitted to the Committee established pursuant\nto that resolution.\nIf the fight against terrorism henceforth occupies\nthe spotlight, that must not obscure the imperative\nnecessity of finding just and lasting solutions to\ninternational crises, particularly regional conflicts that\nso often feed and maintain that scourge. In this\n15\n\nconnection, Burkina Faso welcomes the laudable\ninitiatives of the United Nations to restore peace to\nmany regions of the world, particularly Africa, where\nUnited Nations interventions \u2014 coupled with the\ninitiatives of the Organization of African Unity, which\nhas become the African Union, and those of the\nAfrican subregional organizations \u2014 have made it\npossible to pacify many areas of tension and conflict\nthat were ravaging parts of our continent.\nWe also welcome the gradual return to peace in\nSierra Leone, in Angola, in the Great Lakes region,\nbetween Ethiopia and Eritrea and in Sudan, even if in\nthe latter case we must regret the suspension of the\nagreement between the Government of that country and\nthe armed rebellion.\nIn Western Africa, the hopes that arose at the end\nof the war in Sierra Leone unfortunately seem\nunfulfilled with the resumption of combat in\nneighbouring Liberia.\nWe cannot remain passive in the face of civil war\nin that sister country. Supported by others of goodwill\nand working within the framework of the process of the\nEconomic Community of West African States, Burkina\nFaso convened a meeting in Ouagadougou from 8 to 11\nJuly between a number of Liberian political parties,\ncivil society organizations, associations and\nmovements with a view to renewing the inter-Liberian\ndialogue. By agreeing to host that important meeting,\nmy country, Burkina Faso, hoped to provide a further\nchance for dialogue, which the Liberians themselves\ndesired. The initiative was supportive of efforts that\nhad already been agreed upon in the context of the\nRabat process and the Mano River Union.\nThis year has been particularly bloody in the\nMiddle East. We cannot forget the excesses committed\nin Jenin and the harassment of President Arafat at\nRamallah. The atrocities perpetrated every day against\nthe unarmed Palestinian civilian population are a great\ncause for concern. Dialogue and negotiation must\nprevail over confrontation and violence. Burkina Faso\nreaffirms its support for the creation of an independent\nPalestinian State, existing side by side with Israel, and\nwe strongly urge the Security Council to ensure that its\nrelevant resolutions are implemented.\nWith regard to Iraq, Burkina Faso welcomes the\nfact that reason has prevailed. We remain convinced\nthat unilateral preventive action that is not authorized\nby the Security Council would have dire consequences\nfor world peace. In that connection, we would like to\npay tribute to the courageous decision of the Iraqi\nGovernment, which has just agreed to the return to\nBaghdad of United Nations weapons inspectors. We\nearnestly hope that that approach will ultimately lead to\na definitive resolution of the crisis, especially since the\nsanctions imposed on that country are unjust and have\nmade martyrs of the Iraqi people.\nBurkina Faso has always made it clear that, apart\nfrom their unjust character, sanctions cannot properly\nresolve substantive problems but are\ncounterproductive. We therefore request the lifting of\nall sanctions against Iraq, Cuba and Iran, as well as\nthose imposed on Libya in connection with the\nLockerbie question.\nWith regard to that latter question, Burkina Faso\nbelieves that the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya has fully\ndischarged its obligations to the Security Council and\nthat the sanctions imposed on it should now be lifted.\nAs a result of the demands of globalization,\nprotecting the right to development has become the\nmost important obligation for our countries. We\ntherefore place great hope in the New Partnership for\nAfrica's Development (NEPAD), to which the\nAssembly has just devoted a special debate. We should\nrecall that that new initiative shows how determined\nAfrican leaders are to work tirelessly to rid the\ncontinent of poverty and marginalization.\nDuring a recent forum that took place in\nOuagadougou on the role of the private sector in the\nimplementation of NEPAD, President Blaise Compaore\nstressed two major responsibilities that are incumbent\nupon the international community. The first relates to\nthe enhancement and structural reform of official\ndevelopment assistance so as to adapt it to the needs of\nits beneficiaries and to improve its effect on their\nstandard of living. The second relates to the problem of\nthe access of African goods to the markets of the\nindustrialized countries and the need to put an end to\nanti-competitive subsidies that run counter to the rules\nof the World Trade Organization.\nMore generally, the various meetings on\ndevelopment that have taken place this year, in\nparticular the International Conference on Financing\nfor Development, held at Monterrey, and the World\nSummit on Sustainable Development, held at\nJohannesburg, as well as the commitments set out in\n16\n\nthe Millennium Declaration, open up new and\nencouraging prospects for developing countries.\nIt remains true, however, that the best form of\ndevelopment is that which takes into account the\nrequirements of democracy and human rights. In this\nconnection, I would like to assure the Assembly that\nmy country will be resolute in ensuring that democracy\nbecomes rooted in our political and institutional life,\nand we are taking significant and concrete actions to\nthat end. The people of Burkina Faso have thus just\nrenewed, for a third consecutive time and for a further\nfive years, the mandate of the National Assembly. That\nelection, in which all the political parties took part,\ntook place in a calm, transparent and fair manner and\nhas seated members of 13 political parties to legislate\non questions of interest to the people of Burkina Faso.\nThe Government has also created a Ministry for\nthe Promotion of Human Rights to ensure respect for\nand the implementation of human rights in all their\naspects. That is why my Government welcomes the\nelection of Burkina Faso to the United Nations\nCommission on Human Rights, which will enable us to\nmake a positive and active contribution to the work and\nthe deliberations of that international body, which\nmonitors the implementation of human rights\nthroughout the world. Furthermore, our Government is\ndetermined to greatly enhance the status of women and\nchildren in line with the recommendations of the\nspecial session of the General Assembly on children.\nIt is thus clear that the credibility and\neffectiveness of the United Nations is increasing on a\ndaily basis, whether with regard to the promotion of\npeace and security, to economic cooperation or to\nactivities in the social and humanitarian sphere.\nThe recent admission of Switzerland to the\nUnited Nations and the forthcoming admission of\nTimor-Leste further confirm the irreplaceable role of\nthe United Nations as an means of ensuring\ninternational stability. It is precisely because of that\nuniversality that Burkina Faso is able to call upon the\ninternational community to consider the return of the\nRepublic of China to this world Organization. Taiwan\nhas clearly shown that it is a free, independent,\ndemocratic nation that enjoys all the attributes of a\nState under international law and that would thus be\nable to make a truly useful contribution to the building\nof a better future for humankind. The credibility of the\nUnited Nations is at stake in this respect.\nIn conclusion, I should like, on behalf of my\ncountry, to pay tribute to Mr. Kofi Annan for his\nassured leadership of this Organization, as well as to\nthe staff of the United Nations for their tireless\ncontribution to the quest for peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe international\nagenda was forever changed by the events of 11\nSeptember 2001. The challenge created for the United\nNations was, and is, the same as that for each of its\nMembers: how best to react to those changes. The\ninternational fight against terrorism has thus become a\ntop priority for all of us. It is not only a fight against\nindividuals who conspire to kill innocent people; it is\nalso, in itself, a fight for respect for human life and\nhuman dignity, for the values of liberty, tolerance and\ndemocracy and for the peaceful solution of conflicts.\nThe United Nations immediately pledged its\nMembers to the struggle through a swift reaction by the\nGeneral Assembly and by the Security Council, which\nstated that the terrorist attacks of 11 September were a\nthreat to international peace and security and which\nadopted a resolution, sending out a remarkable signal\nof strength, quickly followed by other international\norganizations, such as the European Union and the\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe\n(OSCE).\nAs members are aware, Portugal currently holds\nthe chairmanship of the OSCE. We have made the fight\nagainst terrorism a priority on the OSCE's agenda. As\nChairman-in-Office, I have been working towards a\nEuropean charter on preventing and fighting terrorism,\nto be adopted at the ministerial meeting to be held in\nPortugal next December.\nBut the United Nations is in a unique position to\ncoordinate and invigorate the international response to\nterrorism. We are called upon to demonstrate that a\nworld in which humanity can live free from fear is not\nonly a common aspiration but also an achievable goal.\nWe trust that the Security Council and the General\nAssembly will live up to their responsibilities in that\nregard. Failure to do so would seriously compromise\nthe credibility of the Organization.\n(spoke in Portuguese; English text furnished by the\ndelegation)\nAt the same time that the world faces the new\nchallenge of terrorism, old challenges persist. The\nMiddle East demands a new peace dynamic. The\nevolution of the Iraqi issue must entail absolute respect\nfor Security Council resolutions and the unconditional\nreturn of United Nations inspectors. Indeed, we\nconsider the problem concerning Iraq often to be\nwrongfully presented: Iraq is a threat to international\nsecurity, and thus pressure must be exerted on Iraq, not\non the United Nations or on one particular country. It is\nIraq that is failing to comply with United Nations\nresolutions. Our goal is to put an end to the threat\nrepresented by weapons of mass destruction. The\nUnited Nations and its Members cannot and must not\ncontinue to tolerate the continuous violation of\nSecurity Council resolutions. Thus, the international\ncommunity must know how to act effectively and must\nbe particularly demanding on this issue.\nThe Security Council should promptly make a\nstatement on Iraq's lack of compliance with Council\nresolutions and on its obligations. It is now up to Iraq\nto seize this opportunity and to cooperate with the\nUnited Nations. But, should Iraq persist in not\ncomplying fully with the Organization within a time\nframe to be determined, the international community\nshould not exclude any alternative or option.\nOn the other hand, two success stories from the\npast year deserve a special reference. First, in Angola,\npeace was achieved and seems irreversible. Portugal\nwill continue to work with the Angola's Government\nand political forces towards the full implementation of\nthe Lusaka Protocol. The United Nations must\ncontribute to that process. Humanitarian assistance is\nvital for the consolidation of the peace process. Those\nsteps, along with free elections and a modern economic\nframework, will surely strengthen peace and\ndemocracy in that country.\nSecondly, East Timor's proclamation of\nindependence on 20 May represents a success for the\npeople of East Timor, for the United Nations and for\nthose who fought for it. The General Assembly will\nsoon proclaim East Timor a new Member. An\nindependent East Timor within the United Nations\ndeeply touches the Portuguese people, who have\nalways believed in the rights of East Timor's people\nand in the justice of their cause. East Timor started\nfrom scratch. It is now up to the international\ncommunity to maintain its support, lest it squander the\nopportunity to meet the challenges of that new country.\nI turn now to a number of other noteworthy\nmatters. As a founding party to the Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court, Portugal believes that the\nelection of a first team of judges will be a crucial step\ntowards the Court's effective functioning and\n20\n\ncredibility. That institution and its regular functioning\nmust become a fixture of the international scene.\nThe New Partnership for Africa's Development\n(NEPAD) underlines the preoccupation of African\ncountries with the values of democracy and human\nrights, as well as sustainable economic development\nand the continent's integration into economic\nglobalization. Bearing such concerns in mind, Portugal\nwill organize the next conference between the\nEuropean Union and Africa, to be held in April 2003.\nAfrica is a priority for us. Therefore, we support\ninitiatives to energize the development policies and\neconomies of that forgotten continent.\nFinally, we welcome Switzerland's accession to\nmembership of the United Nations. The presence of the\nSwiss Confederation will certainly benefit United\nNations action.\n(spoke in English)\nThe way in which the world embraces the new\nchallenges it faces will be the best indication that the\nevents of one year ago resulted in a triumph for the\ninternational community. A safer world is founded on\nsecure countries representing all their people and living\nin peace. That is how terrorism will eventually be\ndefeated, and out of that the new international order\nshould gradually emerge.\nSecurity can no longer be conceived in\nexclusively military terms or solely in terms of\nterritorial defence. Several factors must be taken into\nconsideration: the widespread development of weapons\nof mass destruction; the proliferation of other threats,\nsuch as environmental degradation, diseases such as\nHIV/AIDS, famine and migration, which transcend\nState borders; and factors affecting the ability of many\nStates to face the challenge of globalization. Thus, no\nnation, however powerful, is self-sufficient; not even\nthe greatest of countries can do everything on its own.\nMultilateral cooperation is the key to the future. One of\nthe basic goals of the United Nations should be to\nimplement such cooperation in a practical and\nconsistent manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I\noffer my very best wishes in all your work during the\ncoming session.\nI would also like to thank my colleague, His\nExcellency Mr. Han Seung-soo of the Republic of\nKorea, our regional neighbour, for his leadership of the\nGeneral Assembly over the past year.\nAlso, may I congratulate the Government and the\npeople of the Swiss Confederation on their decision to\njoin the United Nations. They have long given very\ndistinguished support to the institutions of world peace,\nand it will be good to work with them here.\nAt the same time, I would like to welcome the\ncoming membership of our neighbour, the Democratic\nRepublic of East Timor. In doing so I would like to thank\nall the members of the United Nations Transitional\nAdministration in East Timor. We are very grateful for\ntheir fine work there. I assure you that we will be doing\nour best to consolidate those United Nations efforts for\npeace in our region. It has been a pleasure working\nwith President Gusm\u00e3o and his new Government. As\nthey plan their future development, we look forward to\ncontinuing this work, not only bilaterally as friends and\nneighbours, but also through the long-standing process\nof consultation and cooperation we have established\nwithin our regional association.\nI mention this aspect of our regional work for a\nspecific reason. It is the main point I wish to make at\nthis time. The process I refer to has been at the heart of\nthe work of the Association of South-East Asian\nNations (ASEAN) since its founding well over 30 years\nago. It is not confined to our neighbours in South-East\nAsia. It also involves dialogue partners from all over\nthe world as well as all the permanent members of the\nSecurity Council. It now covers the whole spectrum of\ncooperation: political, economic, functional and, since\nthe end of the cold war, all aspects of security\ncooperation. In other words, it is a comprehensive\napproach to modern regional and international affairs.\nIt comprises many layers of cooperation bound\ntogether by one institution, the United Nations. An\nenormous amount of work has gone into it. That is why\nwe place equally enormous value on it. We believe it\noffers a secure way forward for every citizen we\nrepresent.\nI make this point for reasons that deeply concern\nevery one of our colleagues here. In the past year we\nhave been made brutally aware of one terrible fact. The\nwhole process of consultation and cooperation is now\nthreatened. The opportunities it presents to our people\nare profoundly at risk. Like our fellow Members of this\nOrganization, we have had to accept a grim reality.\nThere is a dark side to the international life we share\ntoday: to globalization, to development, to progress, to\nknowledge and even to the beliefs we cherish, whether\nthey be religious, political or social.\nWe have been taken to this dark side. It is a\npitiless, bleak and miserable landscape. There is no\npath through it along which nation-States can safely\nproceed. It is, in that sense, a terrifying vision. In\nSouth-East Asia we have responded to it as such. We\n\n\nhave deeply mourned the innocent victims of terrorism\nin America, Africa, Europe and Asia. We have\ncondemned all who took those lives.\nWe are, however, trying to move beyond\ncondemnation. We have taken many immediate and\npractical short-term measures. We have committed\nourselves to long-term action. We have had to do this.\nWithout security and stability, there is little chance for us\nto implement the far-reaching programme of development\nwe have set for ourselves. So, in no way can we permit\nthose who engage in any form of terrorism to succeed.\nBy this, I mean any group that tries to drag our\naffairs across to their dark side: not just extremists, no\nmatter what cause they claim to represent, but also\nthose who seek to corrupt international systems of\ntrade, commerce, and banking or who wilfully destroy\nour environment or who trade in human misery. They\nstand in the way of the deepest interests of the people\nwe represent here, the people for whom the United\nNations is the direct opposite of the dark vision of the\nterrorist. It offers them a totally different side of world\naffairs: one that rejoices in the diversity of peoples,\ncultures and beliefs; one that at all times seeks the\nconsensus that comes out of dialogue and negotiation;\nand one where informed direction is given to the great\nchanges that are sweeping through all societies \u2014 in other\nwords, the bright side of international affairs lit by a\nbeacon of hope. That is how we see this Organization.\nWe want our regional efforts to help fuel this\nbeacon. We want them to complement the work of the\nUnited Nations.\nSo, put simply, we see only one permanent\nagenda item here: How can the world body give hope\nand purpose to the lives of every family in every\ncommunity in each of its 190 Member nations?\nThat is why we strongly support the efforts being\nmade by the Secretary-General to express our purpose\nin that way, not in the language of confrontation that\nwas heard throughout the last century or in the\nappalling vocabulary of terrorism, but in the human\nterms offered at the Millennium Summit.\nIn short, our hopes include an end to historical\ninjustices, especially those which our brothers in\nPalestine continue to suffer, and a determined effort to\nhelp communities earn a good living in a responsible\nmanner. Those were the basic hopes I believe we all\nhad at the turn of the century. We do not wish to see\nthem set aside. So we appeal to all our fellow Members\nto make sure they are not forgotten. We urge everyone\nto use the mechanisms we have here to that end.\nWhenever there are grave threats to international\npeace, we are confident that the members of the\nSecurity Council will guide us well. We acknowledge\nthe vital role they have in ensuring that international\nprinciples are upheld by every Member. In this, they\nhave our full support, and we will contribute to their\nwork in whatever way we can.\nBut the Council is still only one part of the work\nof the United Nations. There are many other tasks:\nabove all, the peaceful work that binds all our layers of\ncooperation together.\nWe do not wish to see the Organization's\nattention directed solely towards the dark side of\ninternational life. Building a secure framework for\ninternational cooperation involves a long, consistent\nand comprehensive process. Like any process, it has to\nbe constantly refined. We accept this. We do not feel,\nhowever, that the events of the past year mean that it has\nto be abandoned and redesigned. In saying this, I believe\nwe share the deepest hopes of all developing nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We are confident that\nits membership, which formalizes its long involvement\nwith the United Nations, will contribute enormously to\nthe work of the Organization. We look forward to\nwelcoming our newly independent neighbour, the\n7\n\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste, as the 191st\nMember of the United Nations in the very near future.\nMalaysia would also like to congratulate Africa\non the establishment of the African Union and on its\nbold new initiatives, such as the New Partnership for\nAfrica's Development.\nI also thank the Secretary General for his\nstatement before the General Assembly. Malaysia\nshares his concerns over the four issues identified as\nthreats to world peace.\nA year has passed since the evil and cowardly\nattacks against the Organization's host country. As a\nresult, the world has changed fundamentally in many\nways. The international community has been\ngalvanized into fighting all forms of terrorism. There is\ngreater recognition that terrorism is a global problem\nthat crosses borders and lurks in many of our countries,\noften without our knowledge.\nThe Security Council has taken prompt action\nresulting in mandatory measures aimed at eliminating\nall forms and manifestations of terrorism and requiring\nMember States to take legal, administrative, financial\ncontrol and other law enforcement measures. Malaysia\nsupports that action and reiterates its commitment to\ncomprehensively fighting terrorism in all its forms at\nthe domestic, regional and international levels.\nDomestically, our Government has acted swiftly\nand decisively against terrorist groups that have\nthreatened both our national security and international\nsecurity. We have cooperated extensively at the\nbilateral level by sharing intelligence information and\nby implementing measures to cripple transnational\ncrime networks that abet terrorist activities. In the\nSoutheast Asian region, Malaysia and its partners in\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations have\nembarked on a programme of collaboration to deal with\nthe issue at the regional level. At the international\nlevel, in addition to our support of United Nations\nactions and other international and bilateral efforts to\nfight terrorism, Malaysia works closely with the\nmember States of the Organization of the Islamic\nConference and of the Commonwealth.\nHowever, Malaysia believes that in our quest to\ncombat terrorism, the norms and principles of\ninternational law should not be set aside. We also\nbelieve that in dealing with the menace, it is important\nfor the international community to forge a broad\nconsensus on what constitutes terrorism. Without a\nclear and common definition, certain perpetrators of\nterrorist acts will justify their actions in the name of\nState security or national liberation.\nIf the collective effort of the international\ncommunity to win the fight against terrorism is to\nsucceed, we must start looking at the problem in a\ncomprehensive manner and must respond with a\ncomprehensive strategy. It seems that in our urgency to\naddress the problem, we overlook and continue to\nignore why it exists in the first place. We forget that,\nhowever unjustified, terrorism is often rooted in\npolitical and economic grievances that still have not\nbeen adequately addressed. The fight against terrorism\nis not merely a fight against the perpetrators and\nconspirators of terrorist acts; it is also a fight against\npoverty, injustice, subjugation and illegal occupation\nthat breed anger and hatred. There can be no\ncomprehensive victory against terrorism if the root\ncauses of terror are not eliminated.\nMalaysia also regrets the continued association in\ncertain quarters of Islam and Muslims with terrorism,\nas if one were synonymous with the other. We would\nlike to reiterate that no race or religion should be\ncondemned or discriminated against simply because\nsome misguided people from that community are, or\nmay have been, involved in terrorist activities.\nJust as it is easy and convenient to hold a\nmonolithic view of the Muslim world and therefore\nassume the worst about every adherent of the Islamic\nfaith, it is also easy for Muslims to have a similarly\nmonolithic and therefore incorrect view of other\ncivilizations. If we continue to view each other in such\nterms, the confidence that has been engendered in the\ninternational community in our fight against terrorism\ncan be eroded.\nIt is with those considerations in mind that\nMalaysia continues to call for the convening of a high-\nlevel international conference under the auspices of the\nUnited Nations to examine the terrorism issue in all its\nforms and manifestations and to formulate a joint\nresponse to this global threat.\nMalaysia is concerned at the apparent lack of\nurgency in addressing the underlying factors that lead\nto cause terrorism. For example, most of the Muslim\nworld believes that one of the key outstanding issues\nthat continue to elicit resentment and fury is the\nsituation in the Palestinian occupied territories.\n8\n\nMalaysia believes that, while all acts of violence\nagainst innocent civilians \u2014 whether inflicted by\nsuicide bombers or by security forces \u2014 must be\ncondemned, we must be even-handed in our approach\nin dealing with the situation in the region. It is\nimportant that we understand the root causes of\nviolence there. We must put it in its proper context: the\ncontinued occupation of Arab lands by the Israeli\noccupying forces, in particular the demolition of\nPalestinian homes, the devastation of their towns and\ncities, the destruction of their livelihood and\ninstitutions and, worst of all, the loss of thousands of\ncivilian lives and the wounding of tens of thousands\nmore over the decades, which can only result in\nreactions from the Palestinian people. Israel's\noppressive policies and practices have made life for the\nPalestinians unbearable and have engendered only\nhatred and resentment against the occupying Power,\nillegal settlers and those who are perceived to provide\nsupport to them. Israel must take advantage of the\nacceptance of the two-State solution and recognize that\npolitical and security issues must be looked at together.\nIt must also acknowledge the need for the\nestablishment of an international protection force to\nseparate the two parties.\nThe international community, including the\nUnited Nations, cannot afford to stand on the sidelines\nindefinitely. It is time for the Security Council to\nbecome more actively involved and intervene directly\nin the situation, beginning with the dispatch of a\nUnited Nations or other international peacekeeping\nforce to the occupied territories. Failure to act will only\nperpetuate the violence and exacerbate the resentment\nfelt by the Palestinians \u2014 and by the Muslim world in\ngeneral \u2014 towards those who are perceived to be\nresponsible for refusing to address this issue in a fair\nand just manner.\nWe are pleased that Afghanistan is now on the\nthreshold of becoming a viable, progressive and\ndemocratic State. However, many impediments to\nnational unity and cohesion remain. These must be\novercome through sustained international support and,\nmore importantly, through the political will and\ncommitment of the people of Afghanistan themselves.\nSuch support should take the form of increased\ninfusion of development funds and other forms of\nassistance and, more urgently, the promotion of a more\nsecure environment in the whole country. We owe it to\nthe long-suffering Afghan people to assist in the\nrehabilitation of their country and to ensure that the\ncircumstances that led to their civil strife are removed\nand that they will not be abandoned once the\nimmediate task of removing terrorist elements in\nAfghanistan is completed.\nIf the international community does not focus its\nefforts on comprehensively fighting terrorism by\nattempting to find a credible settlement between the\nPalestinians and the Israelis, and on nation-building\nefforts in Afghanistan, it risks being dragged into\nopening up battle fronts that could result in greater\ninstability in the world and hamper efforts at\ncombating terrorism.\nIn particular, we remain concerned that targeting\nIraq outside the framework of the United Nations and\nin contravention of international law would not only be\nwrong, but result in a more volatile world order. In this\nregard, we welcome the decision of the United States\nto work with the United Nations to address this issue\nrather than pursue a unilateral policy of military\nintervention.\nMalaysia agrees that the United Nations must not\nbe cast aside. Engaging the international community\nthrough the United Nations, however, must not be\nmerely an exercise in public diplomacy. The\ninternational community cannot be made to assume\nthat military intervention against Iraq, in pursuit of\nboth disarmament and regime change, is inevitable and\nthat the United Nations is being engaged only as a\nmatter of course.\nThe strength and relevance of this Organization\nhas never come from affirming the unilateral designs of\none Member nation; rather, it rests on the collective\nwill of the international community that emerges from\na multilateral process. Engaging the international\ncommunity means initiating this consensual approach,\nwhich can address security concerns, without\ndestabilizing the region, within the norms of\ninternational law.\nIn this effort, it is imperative that the\ninternational community be presented with clear and\nincontrovertible evidence of the perceived threat posed\nby Iraq to regional and international security. At the\nsame time, every diplomatic and political effort should\nbe made to urge Iraq to fully cooperate with the United\nNations, including by allowing the return of United\nNations weapons inspectors, and to comply with\nSecurity Council resolutions, as every State Member of\n9\n\nthis Organization must do, so as to facilitate a\nresolution to this issue.\nA pre-emptive attack against Iraq without any\ncredible evidence being provided to the international\ncommunity of the threat it poses will have serious\nimplications for the international campaign against\nterrorism. Such an attack may produce real cleavages\nand draw imaginary battle lines between the Muslim\nworld and the West, especially if the continued\noppression of the Palestinians remains unattended-to.\nSuch an attack could swell the ranks of the\ndiscontented in the Muslim world. It would provide a\npretext for depraved extremist groups bent on stoking\nthe flames of populist radicalism to mobilize and\nmultiply. While it is important, therefore, to view the\nIraq issue in terms of regional security, it is equally\nimportant to understand the broader consequences that\nwill follow.\nIn our interdependent world, the need to\nstrengthen the multilateral process is now more urgent\nthan ever if we are to achieve our common goal of a\njust and humane international order based on\ninternational cooperation and solidarity.\nThe broader membership of this Organization has\na vital stake in ensuring the centrality of the\nmultilateral process as embodied by the United Nations\nand its specialized and affiliated agencies. Through it,\nthe Members of the Organization can articulate their\nconcerns and exercise their collective will in the\nprotection and promotion of their interests. It is\ntherefore important to ensure that the Organization and\nall that it stands for are not set aside on the basis of\nexpediency or the exigencies of the moment. In this\ncontext we are reassured by the Secretary-General's\nemphasis on the imperative of the multilateral process.\nAs the country that will hold the forthcoming\nchairmanship of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM),\nMalaysia will work together with other NAM members\nto ensure the continued centrality of this process,\nincluding the promotion of their development agenda.\nIn this context, we must continue to exert our\ncombined efforts to ensure that globalization works for\nthe benefit of all. In order to achieve this, we will have\nto create an international environment that is more\nconducive to satisfying the legitimate development\npriorities and needs of developing countries, as well as\nto addressing the economic imbalances prevailing in\nthe world today.\nThe United Nations has a pivotal role in\nstrengthening the multilateral process. It is ironic that\nin an era of enormous economic, financial and\ntechnological resources and capabilities, the world is\nwitnessing a dangerous crisis of confidence in the\ncredibility of multilateralism as a result of certain\nnegative trends in the international system.\nThis challenge must be squarely and urgently\naddressed and remedial action taken here at the United\nNations and in other relevant international forums. It is\nthe expectation of States Members of the Organization\nthat the United Nations will play a crucial and leading\nrole in all of these efforts. Therein lies the continued\nrelevance of the United Nations to its Member States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe fifty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly is being held one year after the terrible\nterrorist attack of 11 September 2001. The delegation\nof the Central African Republic still intimately feels\nthe strong emotion caused by that attack against liberty\nand democracy.\nThe President of the Republic, the head of State,\nHis Excellency Ange-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9, leading the\ndelegation of the Central African Republic to the\ncommemoration, wanted to reiterate his friendly\nsympathy towards the American Government and\npeople, and to reassert the firm determination of his\ncountry to do everything that is necessary in order to\ncontribute effectively to the legitimate international\ncrusade against all forms of terrorism. Our work is\nstarting within a particular context in the history of\ninternational relations, because never has humanity\nbeen so conscious of the need to confirm its cohesion\nin order to ensure a world of concord, solidarity and\npeace.\nBefore expanding on those facts, Mr. President, I\nwould like to express to Mr. Jan Kavan and the\nmembers of the Bureau our warm congratulations on\nhis election to the presidency of this session. His rich\nexperience, as a great statesman and diplomat, will\nensure the success of our work. That work will benefit\nfrom the full cooperation of the delegation of the\nCentral African Republic. I take this opportunity also\nto express our admiration for his eminent predecessor,\nMr. Han Seung-soo, for the skill and competence with\nwhich he carried out his responsibilities.\nThe determination with which the Secretary-\nGeneral of our Organization, Mr. Kofi Annan, is\nworking, under all circumstances, to make the\nprinciples and ideals of the United Nations prevail,\nonce more elicits our admiration. The President of the\nRepublic, the people and the Government of the\nCentral African Republic, want hereby to assure you of\ntheir support and reiterate their deep gratitude for all\nthe objective reports on the situation in the Central\nAfrican Republic.\nMoreover, the entry of the Swiss Confederation to\nthe United Nations, and soon the entry of the\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste, are evidence of\nthe resolute march of our Organization towards\nuniversality. The Central African Republic wishes to\nwelcome Switzerland and hopes to cooperate closely\n21\n\nwith that country within the framework of the United\nNations.\nTwo years ago, 189 Member States met in this\nvery hall. They set objectives for development for the\nMillennium, such as the reduction of extreme poverty,\neducation for all, promotion of gender equality and the\nempowerment of women, reduction of child mortality,\nimprovement of maternal health, fight against\nHIV/AIDS and other diseases, such as malaria and\ntuberculosis, preservation of a sustainable environment\nand the establishment of a world partnership for\ndevelopment. All States unanimously pledged, through\nmultilateral cooperation, to implement what is called\nthe Millennium Declaration in order to achieve those\nobjectives within 15 years.\nThe findings we made at the Millennium Summit\non the state of the world at that time showed serious\nshortcomings with regard to our will to fulfil\ncollectively the ideals bequeathed to us by the founding\nfathers of our Organization. However, through that\nsame will, we undertook, in the Millennium\nDeclaration, to re-examine these issues so as to set a\ncourse for the world that corresponds to the aspirations\nand expectations of the people.\nHowever, this is far from what has happened. The\nrevolution in information and communications, the\nprogress of science and technology, the liberalization\nof trade and the disappearance of State frontiers, while\naccentuating the phenomenon of globalization, have at\nthe same time led the world into an uncertain and\nunforeseeable future, to the point where the world\ntoday is threatened in the short term with imbalance.\nStates should fully explore all the potential\noffered by multilateral cooperation within the\nframework of the United Nations, particularly to put a\nstop to such threats. These threats, according to our\ndelegation, are essentially of four kinds.\nThe first of these, as you can expect, is the threat\nthat changed the world in one hour. It is called\nterrorism. This diffuse form of organized trans-border\ncrime that foils armies, however powerful they may be,\ncannot be tolerated. The reaction of the international\ncommunity to this new form of aggression must be\nsustained by adhering to resolutions firmly condemning\nsuch actions, and by observing a certain attitude\ntowards the countries and institutions that tolerate their\nauthors. Thus, all together, through solidarity and\nmultilateral cooperation, we shall conquer terrorism,\nwhether committed by a State or a small group.\nThe destruction of the environment, which\nthreatens our future, is also a real threat. We should\nstrive for the sustainable preservation of forests, fauna\nand biodiversity for the benefit of present and future\ngenerations. This subject was eloquently analysed at\nthe Summit on Sustainable Development, held recently\nin Johannesburg. My delegation has no doubt that\ninternational solidarity can here too be of help to\nsafeguard nature. We should like on this occasion to\nexpress our gratitude for the American initiative,\nsupported by the international community, for the\nprotection of the Congo basin, of which the Central\nAfrican Republic is a member.\nThere is one threat, which does not need to be\nnamed because it is so obvious, and that is poverty,\nwhich \u2014 far from declining \u2014 has grown over the\nyears. The Declaration talks about reducing poverty,\nbut must we not first stop manufacturing it? Famine,\nendemic disease, HIV/AIDS and malaria are the daily\nlot of the two thirds of humankind living on barely $1 a\nday. How can we fail to be moved by this? That fringe\nof humanity calls merely for the solidarity that will\nallow it to live in conditions worthy of our civilization.\nIn the face of the drying up of official\ndevelopment assistance, and with respect to the failure\nof certain development initiatives, the African\ncountries have felt that we need to develop some sort\nof partnership with the countries of the North. They\nhave therefore proposed an original plan for the\ndevelopment of Africa through the New Partnership for\nAfrica's Development. The delegation of the Central\nAfrican Republic fervently calls for the worldwide\nsupport of the international community for the\nimplementation of the plan.\nThe many challenges defined at the Millennium\nSummit in terms of goals to be attained, along with the\nnew plan for African development, will have no chance\nof success unless they are fostered in an environment\nof peace, security and stability. However, current\nconditions do not give much cause for optimism,\nalthough we note the occasional positive movement\ntowards the settlement of a few conflicts. Regional\ncrises remain, however, that are no less threatening to\npeace.\nFaithful to its doctrine, the Central African\nRepublic believes that the situation in the Middle East\n22\n\ncan be settled only through the strict implementation of\nthe relevant resolutions of the United Nations on this\nsubject. It deplores the escalation of violence in that\nregion.\nIn the context of its own regional and subregional\nsphere, the Central African Republic highly appreciates\nthe latest developments in the situation in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, in particular the\nsigning of the Pretoria peace agreement with Rwanda\nand the disengagement agreement signed with Uganda.\nIn conclusion, I am compelled to note that my\ncountry, the Central African Republic, is the victim of\ninternational ostracism and of indifference that borders\non contempt. How else is one to understand the silence\nof the international community and the international\nfinancial institutions in the face of calls for\nintervention and of Security Council resolutions\nfollowing on the reports of the Secretary-General since\nthe notorious date of 20 May 2000, and despite the\nappeals of the Organization of African Unity \u2014 now\nthe African Union \u2014 the Community of Sahel-Saharan\nStates and the Central African Economic and Monetary\nCommunity? And yet, our country has come a very\nlong way with respect to good governance \u2014 that\nfetishistic word! \u2014 in politics, economics and finance.\nAs of early 2002, the reduction of corruption is no\nlonger a figment of the imagination, as evinced by the\naction undertaken in our financial offices.\nMy country's situation requires me to call\nattention to the words of the Algerian writer Kateb\nYassin:\n\u201cOur blood must become enflamed and we must\ncatch fire in order to move the spectators. May\nthe world open its eyes not to our mortal remains,\nbut to the wounds of the survivors.\u201d\nThe sustainable development we all dream of will\nbecome a reality only if, here and now, we inject\nsolidarity into international relations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMay I begin by\nextending my warm congratulations to the President\nupon his election. We have every confidence that his\nstewardship of our proceedings will yield fruitful\nresults. Credit is due also to his predecessor, Mr. Han\nSeung-soo, for his deft handling of our affairs. We also\ncongratulate Secretary-General Kofi Annan for the\nleadership he has shown during the past year across a\nvery broad range of subjects. His inaugural remarks,\nwhich have set the tone for our deliberations, are truly\npraiseworthy. We welcome two new Members this\nyear, Switzerland and, soon, East Timor. We look\nforward to working closely with them.\nAs we are all painfully aware, this has been a\nvery difficult year. The day of 11 September 2001\nwitnessed a dastardly act of barbaric terrorism. It also\nunited peace-loving peoples all over the world as never\nbefore. As we continue our struggle to prevent the\nresurgence of such atrocities, we must also address\nourselves seriously to the task of rooting out the causes\nthat spawn such behaviour. Any action in that respect\nshould be based on the widest possible international\nconsensus-building through consultations.\nBangladesh has been and shall always be a\ncommitted and active partner in the coalition against\nterrorism. We have taken every necessary step to share\ninformation and assist in the curbing of terror. We have\nsought to implement Security Council resolution 1373\n(2001), which we ourselves helped to draft and adopt\nlast year as a member of the Council. At the regional\nlevel, we are currently examining ways and means of\nfurther strengthening the South Asian Association for\nRegional Cooperation (SAARC) Regional Convention\non Suppression of Terrorism. Terror is totally\nunconnected to any faith or region. It is a global\nphenomenon that needs to be tackled by means that are\nboth legitimate and consensual.\nThose methods include the promotion of\ndemocracy and democratic values, respect for human\nrights and the rule of law, the peaceful resolution of\nconflicts, peace-building, cooperation towards\nequitable economic development, the eradication of\npoverty, gender equality, measures aimed at\nconfidence-building, mutual respect among races and\npeoples, and harmony \u2014 not clashes \u2014 between\ncultures. Those are the main pillars on which we must\nbuild a world where hope will reign in place of despair.\nIn the construction of this edifice, the architect must be\nthe United Nations \u2014 which, with its Charter\nprinciples and purposes \u2014 is the greatest institution\ncrafted by humankind.\nBangladesh is relentless in the pursuit of those\ngoals, both nationally and internationally. Our\nproblems, as all are aware, are many and varied. Of\nroughly the size of the state of Wisconsin in the United\nStates, we have a population of 130 million people,\nwhich makes us one of the largest nations in the world.\nCenturies of colonial exploitation left us with\ninadequate infrastructure and resources, and\n5\n\nconstrained us in the trap of poverty. Subject to the\nvagaries of nature, our economy was a gamble in\nmonsoons. Soon after our independence, in 1971, we\nwere perceived as an irredeemable basket case.\nSince then, we have come a long way. We have\ndedicated ourselves wholeheartedly to improving the\nquality of life of our people and to their development.\nOur policies were grounded in certain values dear to\nour hearts. We have acted in the firm belief that\ndevelopment is possible only against a matrix of\ndemocracy, human rights and the rule of law; that\nstructures and institutions in society must be inclusive,\nparticipatory and accountable; and that growth must be\npro-poor, pro-environment, pro-equity and pro-women.\nIn our view, tolerance among religions and an\nappreciation of differing opinions must be imbedded in\nthe social psyche. Our rich intellectual heritage and\ncultural tradition have been the source of home-grown\ninnovative ideas such as micro-credit and special\neducational projects that have enabled us to initiate the\nquiet revolution in our society that has led to a process\nof huge societal transformation.\nAs a result, we have been able to achieve many\nsuccesses, which have been widely acclaimed. Despite\nour being a traditional society, through effective family\nplanning programmes we were able to cut the\npopulation growth rate by 50 per cent over the last two\ndecades. In agriculture, we now produce sufficient food\ngrains to feed our entire people. We have invested\nheavily in human resources development and have\nprovided massive budgetary allocations for primary\nand secondary education. Schooling up to twelfth grade\nis free for girl students, and all are awarded stipends.\nGender mainstreaming is a major policy thrust. In\nBangladesh the empowerment of women receives the\nhighest priority. This is achieved mainly through\ninitiatives such as special provisions for education for\ngirl children, employment of women in the garment\nindustry, and micro-credit schemes that generate self-\nemployment for women. Global recognition of these\nendeavours was manifest in our recent election to the\nCommittee on the Elimination of Discrimination\nagainst Women.\nExcellent cooperation exists between the\nGovernment and civil society. Bangladesh hosts some\nof the world's largest and most active non-\ngovernmental organizations. In our development\nprocess, we are ourselves in the driver's seat. A mix of\nappropriate macro-economic policies and effective\nutilization of external assistance has vastly reduced our\ndependence on foreign aid. A document at the\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, held at Monterrey, entitled \u201cSuccessful\ndevelopment: models for the twenty-first century\u201d says\nthat\n\u201cThe lesson in Bangladesh is that official\ndevelopment assistance, when applied in\nconjunction with a country's efforts to resolve its\nown development challenges, can yield dramatic\nresults.\u201d\nToday what we seek is not compassion, largesse or\ncharity, but greater market access for our manufactured\nproducts, fairer trade and more investment. We may\nstill have a long way to go, but we believe we are on\nthe right track.\nAt the international level, we are striving to\nreinforce mutually beneficial and cooperative relations\nwith all countries. We are seeking, in concert with our\ndevelopment partners, to achieve the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. The special efforts made, and the\nsuccesses achieved, in Monterrey, Johannesburg and at\nthe special session on children have given us cause for\nhope. It is now important for all of us to seriously get\ndown to implementing the promises made and to\nachieving the targets set. We are happy that our image\nabroad is one of a responsible, politically stable,\nmoderate, democratic and constructive member of the\ninternational community. We have actively engaged our\nneighbours in the development of cooperation and\nunderstanding. As the Assembly will recall, it was\nPresident Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh who first\nconceived of the concept of the South Asian\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation. Today, our\nPrime Minister, Begum Khaleda Zia, is also committed\nto bringing the Asian cooperation dialogue to fruition.\nAs a demonstration of our commitment to global\nstability and peace, we have voluntarily given up the\nnuclear option and joined the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We actively\nparticipate in peacekeeping operations, and are\ncurrently one of the largest contributors of\npeacekeepers in the United Nations.\nI should note, however, that there are certain\nissues that continue to trouble us. In South Asia, our\nown region, the volatility of the situation between two\nnuclear-capable countries is deeply worrisome.\n6\n\nBangladesh encourages all concerned in South Asia to\nexercise utmost restraint and seek solutions to their\ndifferences through dialogue and meaningful\nengagement.\nAfter emerging from the most destructive episode\nin its history, Afghanistan has yet to be given the\nwherewithal for recovery and reconstruction. The\ninternational community must redouble its efforts to\nsecure peace throughout Afghanistan and accelerate the\nreconstruction and rebuilding of the country. Unless we\ndo so, the long-term security and stability of our region\nwill remain very uncertain.\nIn the Middle East, the continued denial of the\nright of the Palestinian people to their own State and to\nfreedom greatly concern us. The continued illegal\noccupation of Palestinian land, the trampling of human\nrights and the atrocities perpetrated against the\nPalestinian people by Israel must end immediately.\nSerious efforts must be resumed to seek a\ncomprehensive solution to the problem \u2014 a solution\nthat addresses the legitimate concerns of the\nPalestinian people.\nWe welcome the announcement made in Baghdad\nwith regard to the return of the weapons inspectors, and\nwe see this as a significant step towards the fulfilment\nof obligations under Security Council resolutions.\nThe havoc wrought in Africa by ethnic conflict,\ndisease and famine is very disturbing. The financial\nturmoil in Latin America is a matter of anxiety for all\nof us. Commitments to the least developed countries\nremain largely unfulfilled. The existence of large trade-\ndistorting subsidies that impede development is\npainfully clear. Restrictions on the movement of factors\nof production, including manpower, remain a major\nimpediment to progress. Lack of consideration of the\nemotional and human aspects of people's movement\nacross frontiers remains a great source of pain. The\nconcept of a global fund for poverty alleviation\nfinanced through some form of international taxation is\nalso worth considering. These are issues that we, with\nour limited capacity, can do little to influence \u2014\nthough in our modest way we will do our very best to\nhelp. Those who can must do more.\nFor our part, we will play an effective role \u2014 as\nwe are indeed doing \u2014 in all international forums. In\nthe World Trade Organization we will continue to work\nwith others to implement the development objectives of\nthe Doha Round and to pursue fairer trade. We will\ncooperate with the international monetary institutions\nand other agencies, funds and programmes to promote\nthe welfare of our people and those of a comparable\nmilieu. Working within the United Nations, we shall\nendeavour in every possible way to strengthen its\ninstitutions and to support reforms that will render\nthem more participatory, representative and\ndemocratic. These are pledges that are enshrined in the\nvision for the future of the Government of the People's\nRepublic of Bangladesh under the dynamic leadership\nof Begum Khaleda Zia. They are commitments that are\nat the core of the Bangladeshi ethos.\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me\nexpress my country's delight in having Mr. Jan Kavan\npreside over this fifty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly. Antigua and Barbuda owes much to the\nCzech Republic and the adherents of the religious ideas\nof Jan Hus, the Moravians, who arrived in Antigua in\nthe mid-eighteenth century and administered to the\nslaves in a manner uncommon at that time. With\nhumanity and audacity they provided education to\nchattel servants, which was certainly one of the\nfoundations that led to the development of a sturdy,\nprogressive, and optimistic people, who this year\ncelebrate the twenty-first anniversary of successful\nindependence.\nLet me also pay tribute to Mr. Kavan's\npredecessor, His Excellency Han Seung-soo, who\nguided the fifty-sixth session through a perilous period,\nyet found time to formulate positions to streamline our\nwork and enhance the functions of the President. I wish\nadditionally to welcome Switzerland into this body; we\nare mindful of the contributions it has made to our\nendeavours over the many years that we wished that it\nwould become formally incorporated.\nOn 18 June 2001 Antigua and Barbuda ratified\nthe Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court\nand was most pleased when on 11 April 2002 ten States\nsimultaneously deposited instruments of ratification,\nwhich brought the number of States that had ratified\nthe Statute to 66, six more than was required to bring it\ninto force. The reality is that this has been achieved at\na remarkably swift pace, demonstrating that the\nGovernments and peoples of the globe recognized the\nneed for the existence of such a body. My own country\nfollowed the process of development closely and\nparticipated in many conferences, seminars and\npreparatory commissions on the subject.\nThe adoption of the Statute manifested a\nrevolution in legal and moral attitudes toward some of\nthe worst crimes on earth. Whereas many developing\nStates have suffered under the hard yoke of\nglobalization, the International Criminal Court, with its\nprinciples of justice and the rule of law in international\naffairs represents a plus for the globalization process.\nNonetheless, much work remains to be done in\nobtaining worldwide ratification of the Rome Statute,\nensuring that the Court will have the appropriate\nmechanisms in place to begin functioning as early as\npossible and disseminating information to stakeholders\nat the national and international levels about the ICC,\nthe Rome Statute and its supporting documents.\nThe fears of some States concerning the operation\nof the Court when it is effectuated next year must be\novercome. The Statute has sufficient checks and\nbalances to allay all fears, and we remain convinced\nthat the ICC will be a legitimate judicial institution to\nadequately judge individuals for war crimes, genocide\nand crimes against humanity. We reiterate our\nconviction that this can be done while guaranteeing\nStates their rights, as they are protected from any\ninterference by the Court if they pursue such crimes at\nthe national level, and that the prosecutor's\nautonomous power is accompanied by guarantees\nagainst using the Court for specious or politically\nmotivated endeavours.\nAlthough we are thrilled at the pace of\ndevelopment with regard to the Court, if we look closer\nit reveals the peripheral influence of Caribbean States.\n27\n\nIt was Trinidad and Tobago that revived the idea of the\nICC 41 years after the idea was first discussed. But the\nspecific concerns that Trinidad and Tobago and other\nCaribbean States advanced as reasons for creating the\nICC have been put on the back burner. We had pleaded\nfor a court that would try, and sentence, those involved\nin the trans-shipment of narcotics, in carrying out acts\nof terrorism and in committing marine violations,\nincluding those in our territorial waters. I am sure that\nit is not lost on members that in 1989 we were\nemphasizing the need for the proposed court to try\nterrorists. The Court is an acknowledgement of that. It\nemphasizes genocide, crimes against humanity and war\ncrimes \u2014 and we support this. Yet we remain akin to\nRalph Ellison's \u201cinvisible man\u201d.\nDuring the previous session, there were three\nmajor meetings on what can broadly be classified as\nfinancing for development. At Doha, 142 countries\nagreed to launch the next round of World Trade\nOrganization negotiations. Once again developing\ncountries, particularly those with monocultures, found\nthemselves stymied with regard to getting favourable\nterms for their agricultural products, but were\nsuccessful in convincing developed countries that it\nwas acceptable to override patents to stem public\nhealth crises such as HIV/AIDS. Developed nations\nfeared that that would diminish the effectiveness of the\nAgreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual\nProperty Rights and discourage pharmaceutical\nresearch, but proponents of the change argued forcibly\nfrom the humanitarian perspective.\nDelegates from the developing countries left the\nconference hoping to get better results at Monterrey \u2014\na Conference whose title specifically referred to\nfinancing for development. Unfortunately, most\ndecisions were made before the statements of the well-\nprepared delegates from both developed and\ndeveloping countries could be structurally evaluated.\nAt Monterrey, there were repeated references by\nboth developed and developing countries to the fact\nthat half of the world's population lived on less than $2\na day. But to any objective observer, it was never clear\nfrom the pronouncements of the dominant countries\nwhether they could best help by significantly\nincreasing foreign aid or by more concretely targeting\ntheir assistance to make it more effective. Many of the\ndeveloping countries kept signalling that both measures\nwere necessary and should be undertaken.\nIt appeared that women were particularly\ndisappointed with the Conference. The Executive\nDirector of the United Nations Development Fund for\nWomen, Noeleen Heyzer, declared, \u201cyou cannot talk\nabout halving poverty without looking at the\nfeminization of poverty\u201d. Heyzer was critical of the\nfact that the Conference was working with static\npoverty statistics. A member of her staff pointed out\nthat new ways of financing development had to\nconsider protecting domestic industries while preparing\nwomen to take advantage of new opportunities.\nMs. Heyzer stated that the meeting should have\nconsidered institutional and legal barriers to women's\nadvancement, such as banking systems that did not\nlend to women, and customary laws which prevented\nfemale ownership of land.\nIn reality, not only aid, but a complete\noverhauling of the present unidimensional focus of\nglobalization should have come out of Monterrey. The\ngoals \u2014 halving the proportion of people living on less\nthan $1 a day by 2015, accelerating the process of\nproviding access by individuals to clean water, and\nensuring gender equity, particularly with regard to\neducation \u2014 cannot be considered to have been\nadequately dealt with by simply stating that aid from\nthe developed world would increase from $50 billion to\n$100 billion.\nIn addition, it must be recalled that only one third\nof the $50 billion is spent in poor countries, while the\nlevel of aid and the conditionalities attached to it\nmakes it difficult to spend the rest effectively. The\nstringent conditions set by donors also have an impact\non the sovereignty of developing nations. Thus,\njumping from $50 billion to $100 billion without\nrevamping existing measures of disbursal and\nimplementation will not have the desired effect.\nFortunately, the developing countries, through\ntheir perseverance, were able to receive greater\nconsideration in Johannesburg. The recent World\nSummit on Sustainable Development represents the\nstrongest effort by the international community to\npromote sustainable development through the adoption,\nas set out in the Summit's Plan of Implementation, of\nsignificant and concrete commitments to improve the\nlives of people living in poverty and to reverse the\ncontinuing degradation of the global environment.\nAs a small developing State, my country sought\nto contribute to the overriding theme of the Summit:\n28\n\nthe promotion of action. In this respect, we commend\nthe Summit for the major progress made in addressing\nsome of the most pressing concerns of small island\ndeveloping States, namely, poverty and the\nenvironment, and welcome the commitments to\nincrease access to clean water and proper sanitation\nand to energy services; to improve health conditions\nand agriculture, particularly in dry lands; and to better\nprotect the world's biodiversity and ecosystems.\nHowever the Summit's failure to agree on a target date\nfor increasing the use of renewable energy was a major\ndisappointment to all small island developing States.\nThe true test of the Summit's success will be in\nthe follow-up actions at all levels. While in and of\nitself the Summit generated a sense of urgency,\ncommitments for action, and partnerships to achieve\nmeasurable results, concerted activity must be\nundertaken. Antigua and Barbuda therefore calls on all\nactors to honour their commitments and undertake the\nnecessary actions to fight poverty and protect the\nenvironment through the implementation of the\ninternationally agreed development goals, including\nthose contained in the General Assembly's Millennium\nDeclaration and Agenda 21, adopted in Rio de Janeiro\nin 1992. This will require a significant increase in\nfinancial resources, as elaborated in the Monterrey\nConsensus.\nAntigua and Barbuda has every intention of\nadhering to the time allotment, but must of necessity\ntouch on a few other issues. Unfortunately, we must\nrecall the threat of terrorism. We have been working\ndiligently to fulfil the United Nations requirements in\nthat respect. We must, however, move ahead and plan\nfor the future positively. We welcome the New\nPartnership for Africa's Development and are eagerly\nawaiting the entry of East Timor into this body.\nWhile welcoming East Timor, we must again\nexpress our deep dissatisfaction that a referendum has\nnot been held in the Western Sahara. The question of\nthe Western Sahara involves the right of self-\ndetermination, a fundamental principle of the United\nNations. As long as the conflict remains, the regional\nsecurity in a significant part of the Maghreb will\nremain at risk. Clearly, the success or failure of the\nUnited Nations will enhance or compromise the\ncredibility of the current international system.\nA small developing State, such as Antigua and\nBarbuda, cannot deliver a statement at the United\nNations General Assembly without mentioning the\nimperfections of globalization and calling again for\nmeaningful remedies. When we consider the present\nthrust toward globalization, we once again see our lack\nof significance in the global scheme of operations.\nClearly, globalization leads to the reduction of the\nsovereignty of States, with the weakest and the\nsmallest being the biggest losers. Sadly lacking in the\narguments for globalization is mention of the need to\ngive consideration to the pace, direction and content of\nliberalization. We must bear in mind the different\nlevels of development and the need to build up national\ncapabilities. There is much insistence on free trade for\nthe developing world and yet exemptions from free\ntrade are claimed for the industrialized countries.\nProtective devices are built in for farmers in the\ndominant economies. These include subsidies,\nguaranteed markets, payments not to produce beyond a\ncertain level in order to maintain means of processing,\nand all of this is done under the most stringent of\nguidelines.\nOn the other hand, when former colonial\ncountries provide preferences to their previous colonies\nfor investments, challenges are mounted through the\nWorld Trade Organization by multinational enterprises.\nAll this is done with the clear knowledge that in\nmodern times there has never been free trade.\nRecently, the envoy of a very large country,\nseeking the support of Antigua and Barbuda for his\ncandidature to a major international committee, praised\nour twin-island state for its prominence, rationality and\nobjectivity in international affairs. He went on to state\nthat small States are generally more objective in\nrecognizing which countries ought to have positions on\nmajor international bodies. This is, in his view, due to\nthe fact that small States can consider issues without\nhaving to take into consideration the pressures from\nlarge armies and the need to maintain international\nprominence. Consequently, small States view issues\nfrom the perspective of how policies affect the entire\nglobe, of how there can be improvements for all\npeople, and of what the consequences of certain actions\nwill be.\nIt was an exchange that sobered and uplifted me\nfor an entire week. Yes, small States can contribute\nmuch and have a significant role to play in the United\nNations. But we need to be looked at and to be listened\nto. We have much to contribute. We will continue to\n29\n\nspeak out, to speak up, to advocate, to plead and\nentreat. We urge that we be fully recognized, for we are\npositive, compassionate and forward-looking.\nI end by offering to you the motto of my country:\n\u201cEach endeavouring: all achieving.\u201d"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is\na great pleasure to join in the heartfelt congratulations\naddressed to Mr. Jan Kavan on his election to the high\npost of President of the fifty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly. Undoubtedly, he will apply his\nextensive professional and life experience to benefit\n9\n\nthis General Assembly session, so that it will give fresh\nimpetus to the efforts of our universal Organization.\nEast Timor and Switzerland are new Members\nthis year. The international community welcomes them\nwith joy. We congratulate the Governments and peoples\nof those two friendly nations.\nEvery year the issues the United Nations must\naddress become more challenging. The need for a\nuniversal organization has become especially urgent\nover the past decade. It is understandable. The cold war\nhas ended and humanity has entered a new stage of\ndevelopment.\nAddressing global issues and challenges through\ncommon efforts has become a basic dimension of that\nnew stage. Another distinctive feature is the\nconstructive nature of such efforts. A third dimension\nis common understanding that all those efforts, coupled\nwith democratization of internal societies and\ninternational relations, should bring about improved\nliving standards for Member States. The United\nNations can and must play a significant role in\ncoordinating national, regional and international efforts\nin the age of globalization.\nTajikistan has been a Member State for the 10\nyears of its new history. As the Tajik State was being\nestablished, a fratricidal conflict was sweeping the\ncountry. However, over the past five years, peace and\nstability have prevailed in Tajikistan. Respect for Tajik\nhistory and traditions, human rights, an atmosphere of\ntolerance for diverse opinions and views and focus on\nmajor concerns of the nation are all fundamental\ncomponents of the peace process in Tajikistan, whose\nlessons could be applied in resolving conflicts in other\nhotspots of the world.\nTajikistan, which suffered to achieve its\ndemocracy, is creating today a secular society, has a\nsubstantial foundation for its development and looks to\nthe future with optimism. That optimistic outlook is\ndetermined by President Emomali Rakhmonov's\nrational and carefully considered policy of establishing\ngood relations with Tajikistan's neighbours and by the\nassistance and support received from the international\ncommunity.\nThe Tajik people extend special appreciation to\nthe United Nations, which, during the time of our\ndifficult trials, demonstrated in the most effective\nmanner its peacemaking and humanitarian capacities.\nThe United Nations, working in close cooperation with\nthe Tajik Government, is showing in Tajikistan its\ncapacity to strengthen peace and stability. We are\nsatisfied with the performance of the United Nations\nTajikistan Office of Peace-building in our country and\nbelieve that the experience it gained in Tajikistan can\nbe used for the benefit of other States.\nThe rehabilitation of the economy, the eradication\nof poverty, increasing the living standard and job\ncreation are the issues that are still referred to as our\ncountry's most pressing problems. Tajikistan is a State\nwhose social and economic development depends, to a\ngreat extent, on the international community's common\nand comprehensive approach to the issues of\ncombating poverty, financing development, ensuring an\nequitable international trade system, eliminating\necological threats and resolving demographic\nproblems. In that context, we invariably favour further\nenhancement of the role of the United Nations as the\ncore international forum for developing such a\ncommon approach.\nOver the past few months, the Member States\nhave achieved some progress in that area. Overall, we\nbelieve the outcome of the International Conference on\nFinancing for Development in Monterrey was positive,\nand we are looking forward to the implementation of\nits resolutions.\nEnvironmental issues and issues of sustainable\ndevelopment are among the top-ranking items of the\nUnited Nations agenda and, appropriately, are\nbecoming a significant component of multilateral\ndiplomacy. The World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment, recently held in Johannesburg was one\nof the major events in that area. At the Summit, the\nworld's top policy makers analysed the progress made\nin the implementation of Agenda 21 over the past 10\nyears. The concept of sustainable development that\nemerged from the United Nations Conference on\nEnvironment and Development, in Rio de Janeiro in\n1992, was further elaborated and acquired new\nmeaningful content. The international community faces\nthe task of meeting the challenges established at the\nforum in Johannesburg. Accomplishing that task could\ngive us hope that problems such as poverty eradication,\nenvironmental protection and ensuring social equity\ncan be resolved in a comprehensive manner.\nIt is our intention to make a viable contribution to\nimplementing the World Summit resolutions. We hope\n10\n\nthat international cooperation in that area will fully\naccount for the specific conditions and economic\ncapacities of the countries from different groups,\nparticularly, the developing countries and countries\nwith economies in transition.\nOver recent years we have witnessed a dynamic\nprocess in connection with the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, the United\nNations Convention on Biological Diversity and the\nUnited Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.\nThe number of Member States that ratified the Kyoto\nProtocol and the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety is\nincreasing. Interaction between countries in addressing\ndesertification and land degradation issues is gaining\nmomentum.\nTajikistan has been an active participant in those\nimportant processes. We believe it is essential to\nconsistently continue coordination of the\nimplementation of the Conventions in order to avoid\nduplication and ensure effective allocation of limited\ninternational resources.\nAmong the most valuable assets of our planet are\nwater resources. They are at the core of both ecological\nbalance and economic prosperity. They are an\nindispensable prerequisite for food production,\nimprovement of social welfare and economic growth.\nHowever, even today many regions of the world face a\nshortage of fresh water. According to the Secretary-\nGeneral, if current practices of water usage persist, by\n2025 two thirds of the world's population will be living\nin a country experiencing so-called water stress.\nThe urgency of the problem encouraged\nTajikistan to propose the initiative of proclaiming the\nyear 2003 the International Year of Freshwater. We\nbelieve that the preparation for that year and the\nvarious events planned within its framework, in\nparticular, the Third World Water Forum, to be held in\nJapan in March 2003, will give Member States a good\nopportunity to exchange their expertise gained in\napplying successful patterns of water-resource\nmanagement and in searching for needed finances and\nresources.\nIn putting forward the initiative for the\nInternational Year of Freshwater, we expected that the\nmajor focus of the events to be held in 2003 would be\non universal access to freshwater and diminishing the\npossibility of conflicts related to water shortage. That\nwould make a specific and substantial contribution to\nachieving the goals of sustainable development.\nIt is impossible to achieve the goals of\nsustainable development unless the economic\ncomponent of globalization is given due attention and\ndiscrimination in economic relations is eliminated. In\nan environment where wealthy countries benefit from\nglobalization and continue to get richer, while poor\ncounties get poorer, social tensions increase and cause\npolitical extremism, including the most extreme\nform \u2014 namely, terrorism. Counteracting the threat of\nterror is a long-term endeavour, since it is a\nphenomenon that is alien to human civilization, and it\nis multidimensional and deep-rooted. In addition to\nuniting the will of all its participants, applying military\nresources and strengthening the international legal\nframework, the anti-terrorist coalition established\nfollowing 11 September 2001 must direct its efforts\ntowards elimination of the primary reasons for\nterrorism, which can be traced to unsettled conflicts\nand outrageous social and economic inequities.\nTajikistan is actively participating in the common\neffort to ensure a unified international legal framework\nfor combating terrorism. Our country has become a\nparticipant in the most universal anti-terrorist\nconventions. We totally support the activities of the\nSecurity Council in this area. We highly appreciate the\nrole of the Counter-Terrorism Committee that was set\nup in compliance with resolution 1373 (2001), under\nthe leadership of Sir Jeremy Greenstock; this\nCommittee has assumed a central role in the\nunprecedented effort to establish a global system to\ncounteract international terrorism. Pursuant to the\nauthority conferred on it by the United Nations Charter,\nthe Security Council will continue to play an active\nrole in preventing threats to international peace and\nsecurity posed by terrorism.\nIt is essential to continue using all kinds of\npolitical, economic, financial and humanitarian\nmeasures in order to develop a comprehensive\napproach to the eradication of international terrorism.\nIt is important that the development of fundamental\nprinciples to combat terrorism be enhanced at the\ninternational legal level. In this connection, we expect\nthe General Assembly shortly to adopt a\ncomprehensive convention on combating international\nterrorism, as well as to complete negotiating and\nadopting a comprehensive international convention on\ncombating acts of nuclear terrorism.\n\n\nWe believe the time has come to convene a\nspecial session of the General Assembly in 2003 to\ndiscuss all aspects of combating terrorism and to adopt\nconsolidated decisions. At that time, we could also\ndiscuss the progress made over five years on the\nimplementation of the decisions of the twentieth\nspecial session dedicated to the illicit production, sale\nand trafficking of narcotics. In view of the ever-\nincreasing drug threat, we regard the creation of an\nanti-narcotics coalition of States as an issue of critical\nimportance. The war against the international terrorist\nunderground will not be effective until the international\ncommunity makes substantial progress in its struggle\nagainst drug cartels and narco-barons.\nA future global system of counteracting terrorist\nand narcotics threats cannot be created without support\nfrom regional and subregional structures and\ninstitutions that have been active in this and other areas\nof international cooperation.\nAn increase in the number of regional\norganizations and the strengthening of their\nmechanisms not only reflects an objective need for\nfilling the lacunae in the interaction of neighbouring\nStates, but also meets the urgent need to establish\nadditional channels for conducting a dialogue and\nexchange of views on the most important issues. The\nlarge-scale operations to liberate the Afghan people\nfrom the repressive Taliban regime and measures aimed\nat the restoration of peace and stability in war-ravaged\nAfghanistan have demonstrated what can be\naccomplished when the United Nations and regional\norganizations combine their efforts.\nToday, our friendly neighbour, Afghanistan,\ncontinues to go through a complicated process of\nachieving national accord and establishing stable\ninstitutions of government and a stable political\nregime. The revival of an independent and peaceful\nAfghanistan is taking place under difficult conditions.\nThe urgent problem of providing security still exists.\nThe humanitarian situation also remains alarming.\nHowever, what has been accomplished by the\nGovernment of Hamid Karzai is very impressive.\nIt is important that the United Nations continue to\ncoordinate the international community's common\nefforts in strengthening the process of restoring and\nrehabilitating post-war Afghanistan and completing the\nelimination of hotbeds of international terrorism on its\nterritory and the eradication of religious extremism and\nthe narcotics threat. In this context, the United Nations\nAssistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) faces\nserious challenges. We believe it is necessary to\ncontinue increasing economic and humanitarian\nassistance to Afghanistan and not stop at what has been\naccomplished so far.\nThe Government of Tajikistan will continue to\ncontribute to the revival of Afghanistan through\nbuilding its relations with the friendly Afghan people\non the basis of friendship, mutual respect and\nmultifaceted cooperation for the benefit of our two\ncountries and regional security.\nWith respect to reform of the United Nations, and\nregional issues, it is important to realize that neither\nglobal challenges nor most of the urgent regional issues\ncan be dealt with successfully unless the whole United\nNations system is strengthened and its core role in\ninternational affairs is reinforced. To achieve this in\npractice, one has to support the Secretary-General in\nhis efforts to reform the United Nations internal system\nand to recruit personnel with high professional skills.\nThe Member States should assist the Secretary-General\nin his efforts to expand the capacity of the Secretariat\nto carry out peacekeeping operations, prevent and\nresolve conflicts and contribute to post-conflict peace-\nbuilding. Reform also implies further efforts towards\ndemocratization of the United Nations system as a\nwhole, so that the capacities and contributions of small\ncountries, no matter how numerous their problems, can\nbe united with those of large States.\nWe are firmly convinced that reforms should\nfocus on improving the efficiency of special United\nNations institutions and on the implementation of\ndevelopment projects. We deem it important that the\nUnited Nations reconsider the allocation of its\nresources, that it stop implementing programmes and\nprojects of low effectiveness, and instead commit the\nfreed funds to new priorities.\nThe year that has passed since the fifty-sixth\nAssembly session has convincingly demonstrated that\nthe United Nations, with its 190 Member States, is\nirreplaceable when dealing with international affairs.\nAs never before, the United Nations has proven its\nability to meet the most complicated challenges faced\nby humanity. It is our conviction that, in the twenty-\nfirst century, by cooperating with the United Nations,\nwe will be able to create a world without destructive\nwars, a world that will become secure and prosperous.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn\nbehalf of the Government and people of Solomon\nIslands, I wish to congratulate the President on his\nelection to the presidency of the fifty-seventh session\n4\n\nof the General Assembly. I am confident that, under his\nexperience and skilful leadership, we will reach\npositive results for this Organization and for all\npeoples of the world.\nI also thank His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-Soo,\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic\nof Korea, for his distinguished service in presiding\nover the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly.\nIn the same manner, I thank His Excellency Mr.\nKofi Annan, Secretary-General, for his good and\nuntiring efforts and his dedication aimed at realizing\nthe principles and purposes of the United Nations.\nLike others who have spoken before me, I also\nwish to congratulate East Timor, our close Pacific\nneighbour that is soon to be a member of the United\nNations, and Switzerland as a new member of the\nUnited Nations. Solomon Islands looks forward to\ndeveloping further relationships with those two\ncountries through bilateral and multilateral means.\nAs we journey into this new millennium,\nchallenges facing the international community are more\ndaunting. Human ingenuity and technological advances\ncomplicate those challenges. Acts of terrorism and\narmed conflicts proliferate in many parts of the world.\nProspects for progressive economic and social services\nand security, and improved living standards for the vast\nmajority of the world's population have become mere\nunrealized dreams.\nNonetheless, as an international instrument for\nthe promotion and the betterment of human life, the\nUnited Nations has considerable ability and experience\nin pursuing what is best for the common good of all\npeoples around the world, including guaranteeing\nworld peace and security through the Security Council.\nToday I reaffirm the commitment of Solomon\nIslands to the principles of the Charter. I also wish to\nplace on record the appreciation of Solomon Islands for\nthe worthy assistance from other United Nations organs\nand agencies, including the Economic and Social\nCouncil, the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP), the International Labour Organization (ILO),\nthe World Health Organization (WHO), the United\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization (UNESCO) and the Commission on\nHuman Rights.\nSolomon Islands also upholds its faith in the\nSecurity Council and acknowledge its important role in\nthe maintenance and promotion of international peace\nand security. At the same time, we recognize the\nchanging scene in the international political and\nsecurity environment. Those changes must be reflected\nin our Organization as well. The reform of the Security\nCouncil must continue, including a review on the\nrelevance of the provisions of veto power accorded to\npermanent members. Moreover, Solomon Islands\nsupports the expansion of the permanent membership\nof the Council to include Japan and Germany. Those\ntwo countries have so much influence in the global\npolitical and economic arena and therefore they are\nbetter placed to contribute constructively and positively\nto world peace and security.\nFor a small island nation like Solomon Islands,\nthe United Nations is the foremost institution to turn to\nin time of trouble and need. My predecessor stated that\nfrom this rostrum last year. At that time, he elaborated\non the circumstances of the conflict that had erupted in\nSolomon Islands between November 1998 and October\n2000.\nToday, we are still struggling with the outcome of\nthat devastating conflict. We have lost much. We have\nto do much more to reconstruct the destroyed fabric of\nour country. That is the course my Government has\ncharted, in order to maintain our sovereignty with\ndignity and to show integrity and respect as a Member\nof the United Nations family.\nThe mandate to lead the country was clearly\ngiven to me through the democratic process when\nSolomon Islands held its post-conflict general election\non 5 December 2001. The polls returned a new\nParliament of 50 duly elected members, charged with a\nclear working majority of 29 out of the 50 members.\nThe national coalition Government for peace, unity and\nreconstruction assumed office and undertook the\nchallenging task of rebuilding Solomon Islands.\nThe foremost strategy that my Government has\nadopted is to pursue four policy areas: first, the\nrestoration of peace and security; secondly, education;\nthirdly, health and medial services; and, fourthly,\nproductive sectors.\nWe began this important work during the first 100\ndays of entering into office. We have since\nconsolidated our efforts, notwithstanding practical\ndifficulties that emanate from the lack of financial and\nthe absence of other relevant resources.\n5\n\nOur second strategy is the formulation of a\nnational economic recovery plan. That plan focuses on\nstrengthening agriculture, fisheries, forestry, mining,\nmanufacturing, tourism and infrastructure development\nsectors. Besides giving closer attention to the\npromotion of health and education services, the plan\nalso addresses population growth and ensures\npromotion of responsible environmental management.\nI am happy to state that, at present, we are also\nworking on a sustainable development plan for our\ncountry. An integrated financial package for this\nstrategy has been submitted to our development\npartners. Thus far, the responses received, while\nencouraging, still raise questions that require serious\nand genuine consideration in view of our present\ncircumstances. It is here that we sincerely look to the\nUnited Nations for assistance in facilitating closer\nconsultation and constructive engagement with the\nWorld Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the\nAsian Development Bank.\nThe huge amount of debt that burdens poor\ncountries is real, and it continues to afflict most third-\nworld countries, including small States such as\nSolomon Islands. This is a real challenge that my\npeople and country face as we make our best efforts\nand endeavours to rebuild our nation and maintain our\nindependence and sovereignty with dignity, integrity\nand respect during these difficult times and in the\nfuture. On this important point, the United Nations\nshould consider supporting debt forgiveness for\ncountries that are debt-strapped. Solomon Islands can\nbe included in this category.\nA few days ago, the people of the City of New\nYork, the United States of America and the rest of the\nworld paid moving tributes to the thousands of\ninnocent lives tragically lost through the cowardly and\nsenseless acts of terrorism committed on 11 September\n2001. The heroic men and women who perished at that\nsad time now deserve a special place in our hearts and\nin the annals of history.\nMy Government is taking steps to accede to a\nnumber of international conventions relating to\ncounter-terrorist activities. We have communicated\nthese important measures to the United Nations. We\nseek the assistance of the United Nations and members\nof the international community to enhance our efforts.\nThe increase in armed conflicts and the illegal\ntrade of small arms are directly linked. Armed conflicts\nhave increased in most parts of the world. They are\nfuelled mainly by the availability of the illegal\nmanufacture, official sale or supply of small arms, and\nthis has resulted in the loss of innocent life. Over the\npast 50 years, small weapons and landmines have\nkilled more people than weapons of mass destruction.\nSmall arms have also found their way into\nSolomon Islands, and they have been used in the three-\nyear conflict which has adversely affected my\ncountry's sociocultural cohesiveness and good\ngovernance. In no uncertain manner, this has crippled\nthe economy. The continuing presence of small arms in\ncommunities has posed a major threat to the peace,\nsecurity and stability of my nation. Any hope of\neconomic recovery is constantly threatened by\nlawlessness. Notwithstanding this, the Government\nremains committed, within its limited resources, to\nretrieving arms and restoring confidence to our people\nin the communities. However, we believe that the\ninternational community, through the United Nations,\nhas a pivotal role to play in assisting the country to rid\nitself of armed threats by taking more ambitious action\nto curb the arms culture that is taking root in our\ncountry.\nPeace of mind and safety from danger are not\nachieved by the mere absence of war. Rather, they are\nthe product of a nation's ability to achieve sustainable\neconomic prosperity, better education, and health and\nsocial services for all its people. Peace and security for\nevery human soul comes down simply to meeting the\nmost basic needs.\nEven with the successful outcome of the World\nSummit on Sustainable Development, which included\npromises of economic growth and protection of our\nenvironment, Solomon Islands remains sceptical about\nthe practical outcome of action plans for developing\nand least developed countries. We have committed\nourselves to similar action plans for sustainable\ndevelopment in the past. Agenda 21 of 1992 and the\nBarbados Programme of Action for small island\ndeveloping States, among others, are valid policy\nblueprints for sustainable development. Unfortunately,\nwe have not lived up to our commitments. We all have\nfailed. That is why world leaders again assembled, in\nSouth Africa, to take stock of our failures and make\nnew commitments. And indeed, new commitments\nhave been made. Now is the time to test the\ncommitments made in South Africa.\n6\n\nAs The Honourable Laisenia Qarase, Prime\nMinister of Fiji and Chairman of the Pacific Islands\nForum, aptly said in his address at the World Summit,\nlet us turn our words into deeds. Solomon Islands can\nonly hope that, this time around, there is a will to lead\nus eventually to the goals and objectives set at the\nWorld Summit in South Africa.\nSolomon Islands is very much aware of its\nvulnerability to natural and man-induced disasters.\nLike other small island developing countries, we\ncontinue to seek of the international community not\nonly to recognize the uniqueness of our vulnerability\nbut also to take concerted action towards achieving\nmany of our goals and objectives for sustainable\ndevelopment, collectively as a group and individually\nas nations.\nThe communiqu\u00c8 issued by the recent Pacific\nIslands Forum summit held last August in Suva, Fiji,\nreflects the political, economic, security and\nenvironmental issues that are important to the region.\nThese need our collective resolve, as well as the\nattention and cooperation of the wider international\ncommunity.\nThe adverse impact of sea-level rise is a threat to\nthe economies and survival of small and low-lying\nisland countries, in particular in the Pacific, the\nCaribbean and the Indian Ocean. Scientific research\nand reports, including the Third Assessment Report of\nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, issued\nin 2001, have given us all the more reason to be deeply\nconcerned. Solomon Islands joins other small island\nStates in calling again on the countries that have yet to\nbecome parties to the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol\nto do so, and seriously to commit to reducing their\ngreenhouse gas emissions.\nThe least developed countries still grapple with\nthe harsh realities of poverty, vulnerability to external\neconomic shocks, debt burden, poor infrastructure, and\npoor or limited access to better education, health,\nsocial services  and the list goes on. Even with an\nincreasing commitment to globalization, the situation\nof many least developed countries and nation-States\nhas neither improved nor stabilized. In many instances,\nconditions have worsened.\nSolomon Islands believes that the renewed\ncommitment through the Brussels Programme of\nAction for the Least Developed Countries for the\nDecade 2001-2010, adopted at the Third United\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries,\nis a timely action by all international organizations to\nrefocus attention and global resources on the neediest\nand poorest countries. We support the immediate\nimplementation of the Programme and note with\nsatisfaction the progress that has been made so far.\nSolomon Islands once again calls upon the United\nNations to respect the expressed wish of the\nGovernment and the people of the Republic of China to\nbe readmitted as a full and equal member of this\nOrganization. The world has marvelled at Taiwan's\neconomic transformation. Within a short span of time,\nit has not only established a stable and vibrant\ndomestic economy, but also has become one of the\nworld's most influential economies in terms of\ninternational trade, investment outflows and\ninformation technology. Taiwan is a sovereign country\nin full control of its own affairs and with influence in\nthe world economy, and it is unjust to deny its people\nthe right to stand tall and be counted among the many\nnations represented in international institutions.\nTaiwan is a willing and able country, ready to\nshoulder the obligations of the United Nations and\nother international organizations. Taiwan has proved\nitself through its international economic cooperation\nwith many developing and least developed countries.\nSolomon Islands is convinced that that there are no\nlegal barriers to Taiwan's membership in the United\nNations, only political obstacles. Let us therefore cast\naside those political obstacles and take a positive\napproach by according the Government and the people\nof the Republic of China the membership they deserve\nand the opportunity to fully participate in the affairs of\nthe United Nations under its Charter.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThis\nsession of the General Assembly is beginning in a\ncontext that is still deeply affected by the memory of\nthe painful events that struck the United States, and\nespecially our host city, just a year ago. So I shall\nbegin by paying tribute to the memory of the victims of\nthe attacks of 11 September 2001. This sacrifice is a\ncruel reminder of how fragile our world remains,\nexposed to the most unimaginable threats. Humankind\nneeds solidarity, and the Congolese people reaffirms\nhere, through me, its solidarity with the people of the\nUnited States.\nThe election of Mr. Jan Kavan to preside over the\nwork of the fifty-seventh session is a tribute to his\nbeautiful country, the Czech Republic, and to his\nreputation as an outstanding statesman whose\nexperience and knowledge will inspire and guide our\nwork.\nTo Mr. Han Seung-soo, President of the Assembly\nat its fifty-sixth session, we express our earnest thanks\nfor his excellent work. Likewise, we express to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, our profound\ngratitude and our wishes for success in the noble\nmission that he is brilliantly carrying out at the head of\nthe Organization. Finally, we welcome and\ncongratulate the Swiss Confederation on the occasion\nof its admission to the Organization. Undoubtedly, that\nis a major event for the United Nations, which thereby\ncontinues to increase its effectiveness.\nTwo years ago, during the Millennium Summit,\nheld in this Hall, the international expressed its wish to\nsee established throughout the world a climate of peace\nand security favouring broad prospects for international\ncooperation, with a view to sustained world\ndevelopment. During that historic meeting, the world's\nleaders adopted a Declaration whose ambitions were\ncommensurate with the high stakes. In particular, they\ncommitted themselves to reducing by half by the year\n2015 the proportion of the world's population living in\nconditions of extreme poverty.\nSince the Millennium Summit, the international\ncommunity has convened a number of meetings whose\nobjective was to improve the lives of our peoples\nthrough policies of shared management, of solidarity\nand of preserving the future in various areas involving\nthe responsibility of our States. We should periodically\nevaluate our progress, and the current session offers us\nthat opportunity.\nThe absence of peace  war and insecurity  is\ngravely undermining humanity. Unfortunately, no\nregion in the world has been spared. Because of\nirrationality, the Middle East, a veritable powder keg,\nis unravelling before us. The international community\nmust become further involved in the talks between\nPalestinian and Israelis in order to put an end to the\ncycle of violence that has ravaged that part of the world\nfor so long.\nOur own subregion, which covers the Economic\nCommunity of Central African States  over which we\npreside  longs for peace and security. Having\nsuffered years of war and instability, Central Africa has\nonly one desire: to emerge quickly from this infernal\ncycle. In that connection, we should firmly seize every\nopportunity available to us in order permanently to\nreverse old trends.\nIn Angola, the 4 April 2002 signing of a\nMemorandum of Understanding as an addendum to the\nLusaka Protocol offers a glimmer of hope. We welcome\nthe signing of that agreement and, in the same spirit,\nmake an earnest appeal to the international community\nto give its full support to the populations of those\ncountries faced with dire poverty.\nThe situation in Burundi remains worrisome\ndespite the formation of a Government of national\n\n\nunity. We ask the parties to go even further and to\nbegin honest negotiations that could give South African\nmediation, which we encourage, every chance of\nsuccess.\nWith regard to the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo, we welcome the peace Agreement of 30 July\n2002, signed in Pretoria between the heads of State of\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and of Rwanda.\nWe also see as a positive development the agreement\nreached a few days ago in Luanda between the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda. By the\nsame token, we encourage the efforts of the Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo aimed at concluding\nan inclusive agreement involving all the sons and\ndaughters of that brotherly country.\nIn the light of the foregoing, I should like to ask\nthe Assembly to devote all necessary attention to the\nactivities of the United Nations Standing Advisory\nCommittee on Security Questions in Central Africa.\nThat Committee has just held its 18th ministerial\nmeeting, in Bangui, Central African Republic, and will\nreport to the Assembly during the current session. Its\nrecommendations deserve broad support from the\ninternational community. Central Africa needs to\nregain peace and stability in order to play the major\nrole warranted by its immense potential.\nMost of the conflicts that afflict our planet have\ntheir roots in the extreme poverty from which\npopulations  especially in developing countries \nare suffering. Their poverty is marked by\nunderdevelopment, with all its evil effects, which\nprevent them from adapting to the new context of the\ninternational economy.\nIt is with the goal of stopping the cycle of dire\npoverty that Africa has established, along with the new\nAfrican Union, an original plan for its development:\nthe New Partnership for Africa's Development\n(NEPAD). NEPAD is Africa's contribution to assisting\nin its own development. This development choice\nshares the spirit of the new partnership defined in\nMarch 2002 by the Monterrey Consensus and the goals\nof the Rome World Food Summit and of the\nJohannesburg World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment.\nSince 15 October 1997, when the transition\nperiod in Congo began, my country has been facing\nmajor challenges.\nThe first of these challenges  to conclude the\ntransition and the electoral process  has been met.\nThis political development, in spite of the setbacks and\ndifficulties encountered, has led, thanks to the\ndetermination of the Congolese people, to the\nestablishment this year of new democratic institutions\nfollowing free and fair general elections.\nThe achievement of that first objective has given\nus ample opportunity better to take up the other\nchallenges and priorities ahead of us, namely the\nstrengthening of peace and security, the consolidation\nof national unity and democracy, the promotion of\nhuman rights, economic reconstruction, and the\nrevitalization of international cooperation.\nOur determination to engage in active and\ndynamic international cooperation is reflected in\nparticular in our effective participation in Central\nAfrican activities through the Economic and Monetary\nCommunity of Central African States and the\nEconomic Community of Central African States, of\nwhich Congo holds the presidency; in our vision of a\ncommon future for the peoples of the subregion; and in\nour resolute commitment to the Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment.\nIt is with great pleasure and conviction that I\nconvey to the Assembly the optimism and high hopes\nof the Congo  a State that has reclaimed its place in\nthe community of nations and intends to keep it. It\nwishes to serve as a genuine haven of peace, well-\nbeing, prosperity and modernity for current and future\ngenerations.\nIt is with current and, in particular, future\ngenerations in mind that we have resolved, along with\nfive other Central African States, to wage a widespread\ncampaign to preserve forests, animal life and\nbiodiversity in the Congo River Basin.\nWe welcome the determination of the United\nStates of America, France, Germany, Great Britain,\nJapan and South Africa, as well as that of major\ninternational organizations, specialized non-\ngovernmental organizations and forestry companies to\ntake an active part in what we call the Congo Basin\nInitiative.\nIt is also with the goal of speeding up the\nimplementation of the objectives of sustainable\ndevelopment and of a healthy environment that my\n12\n\ncountry is committed to acceding, in the coming\nmonths, to the Kyoto Protocol.\nThe Congo hopes to be a State that unreservedly\nabides by the universal principles and values of human\nrights, peace, fundamental freedoms and good\ngovernance.\nThere can be no doubt that this vision is shared\nby all of our States. It is the basis our of Organization,\nwhose principal objective is to work for peace and\nfreedom throughout the world.\nThe United Nations must tirelessly and resolutely\nwork daily for the triumph of peace and freedom. Let\nus not forget this. We cannot forget that the United\nNations was create to save succeeding generations\nfrom the scourge of war'. It was created essentially for\npeace.\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like, Sir, to\nextend to you my warmest congratulations on your\nelection as President of the fifty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I have no doubt that your long\nexperience and proven diplomatic skills will\nsuccessfully steer the work of this session. I would also\nlike to extend my appreciation to your predecessor, His\nExcellency Mr. Han Seung-soo, for his effective and\ndetermined guidance during the work of the fifty-sixth\nsession.\nCyprus joins other States in extending a warm\nwelcome to the newest Member of the United Nations,\nSwitzerland, and we look forward also to welcoming\nEast Timor.\nThe opening of this session coincides with a time\nof overwhelming challenges for the international\ncommunity. The fact that the global problems are so\nnumerous demands a determined and collective\nresponse and necessitates the enhancement of the role\nof the United Nations as the leading mechanism in\nsecuring world peace and stability.\nCyprus would like to reaffirm its strong devotion\nto the United Nations and its commitment to the cause\nof international cooperation and multilateralism, so\neloquently advocated and defended in the Secretary-\nGeneral's statement to the General Assembly on 12\nSeptember 2002.\nIt is our firm belief that the international\ncommunity should act in accordance with the\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and that all\nUnited Nations resolutions should be implemented.\nSuch an approach will not only enhance the credibility\nof the Organization, but will also facilitate the\nachievement of permanent solutions based on\nobjectivity, justice and international law.\nIn the case of Cyprus, numerous resolutions of\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council have\nyet to be implemented. Contrary to its obligations\nunder the Charter, Turkey shows its defiance by calling\nfor the acceptance of the so-called realities brought\nabout by its aggression. Twenty-eight years have\npassed since the tragic summer of 1974, and the people\nof Cyprus, both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots,\nare still suffering from the terrible consequences of the\nTurkish invasion and the continuing military\noccupation of 37 per cent of the Republic's territory.\nThe Government of Cyprus, however, does not\nwant to engage in polemics with Turkey. On the\ncontrary, we believe that we should move beyond\nconfrontation towards a common future of prosperity,\ndemocracy and regional cooperation. In this respect,\nboth sides should seize the moment and take advantage\nof the current window of opportunity for the\nachievement of a just and viable settlement of the\nCyprus problem, based on Security Council\nresolutions, which represent the verdict of the\ninternational community and its collective wisdom.\nThe time to engage in a serious, meaningful\ndialogue is now, given the unique convergence of\npositive factors, including the renewed interest of the\ninternational community, the personal involvement and\ncommitment of the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nto whom we express our appreciation, and the\nEuropean Union accession process for Cyprus.\nRegrettably, the international community has yet\nto see the greatly anticipated change of attitude on the\nTurkish side. The Security Council, in its statement of\n9 July, authoritatively declared that\n14\n\n\u201cthe Turkish Cypriot side had been less\nconstructive in its approach so far, and had\ndeclined to support the goal of resolving the core\nissues\u201d. (Press Release SC/7444)\nThe Council also strongly underscored the need\nfor the Turkish side to cooperate fully in the ongoing\neffort for a comprehensive settlement, taking into full\nconsideration the relevant Security Council resolutions\nand treaties.\nWe invite Turkey and the Turkish-Cypriot\nleadership to heed the call of the international\ncommunity and abandon its unacceptable policy of\ndivision and communal segregation. Their position in\nfavour of a \u201ctwo sovereign States\u201d solution and of the\ndenial of the rights of refugees to their property\nrepresents an anachronism in a globalized world \u2014 a\nworld in which we view diversity as an enrichment and\nare bound together by integration, the quest for\ndemocracy and the rule of law. Most importantly, such\na policy cannot lead to a settlement or to reconciliation,\nand would thus perpetuate the suffering and the plight\nof all Cypriots. We call on the Turkish side to respect\nSecurity Council resolutions, and the high-level\nagreements signed by Mr. Denktash himself, which\nprovide for a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation and\nwhich envision a State with a single sovereignty, single\ncitizenship and a single international character.\nIn keeping with the interests of our people and\nwith the need for regional stability, our vision for\nCyprus represents a departure from the passions of the\npast. We see the future of our country in a reunited\nfederal State, with membership in the European Union\nand with the human rights and fundamental freedoms\nof each and every citizen fully protected. We are aware\nthat the overwhelming majority of Turkish Cypriots\nshare this vision and long for reunification and for a\ncommon future in the European Union, with all the\nsafeguards of a modern, democratic and effective State.\nThey know that the accession of Cyprus would offer to\nall its citizens security and social and economic\nadvancement, especially for the Turkish Cypriot\ncommunity.\nAs for our side, President Clerides, who has been\nparticipating in the talks in a constructive and positive\nmanner, thereby earning the respect of the international\ncommunity, will continue to show determination and\nfarsightedness so as to fully safeguard the interests of\nCyprus and its people.\nOne year has passed since the heinous attacks of\n11 September, which dramatically changed the\ninternational political climate. The immediate actions\nof the United Nations in the aftermath of the attacks\nreaffirmed the strong determination of the international\ncommunity to counteract the global threat of terrorism,\nwhich transcends geographical regions and religions.\nCyprus believes in the necessity of global\nmobilization and collective action against terrorism,\nunder the auspices of the United Nations. It has\nbecome evident that in the fight against terrorism, the\nimportance of an individual country is not related to its\nsize or its geographic location. Every State has a vital\ncontribution to make in the struggle to combat this\nthreat to our common values. The Government of the\nRepublic of Cyprus reaffirms its commitment to this\nstruggle through full implementation of all relevant\ninternational conventions and protocols relating to\nterrorism, as well as of Security Council resolutions.\nOur determination has been explicitly stated at the\nhighest level and through our ratification of all 12 of\nthe international conventions and protocols pertaining\nto international terrorism.\nTwo recent international events deserve special\nmention, since they have created a momentum for\ninternational cooperation on issues of a political,\neconomic, environmental and legal nature. The first\nsession of the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome\nStatute was a veritable landmark in combating\nimpunity and deterring genocide, war crimes, crimes\nagainst humanity and aggression.\nOn the other hand, the World Summit on\nSustainable Development reaffirmed the necessity for\ncoordinated and effective international action in the\nform of a joint effort to overcome the challenges of\neconomic disparity and environmental degradation. It\nis now imperative to achieve the effective\nimplementation of all the commitments that have been\nundertaken. Turning a blind eye to nature's warnings\nwill exacerbate the problem and make their\nconsequences for the global ecosystem irreversible.\nCyprus also reiterates the need for joint efforts to\nimplement the Millennium Development Goals and the\nMonterrey Consensus. Moreover, my country attaches\nparticular importance to strengthening the New\nPartnership for Africa's Development, which represents\na viable opportunity for the African continent to escape\nmarginalization and underdevelopment.\n15\n\nThe situation in the Middle East remains fragile;\nits repercussions could seriously threaten stability far\nbeyond the region. Cyprus, as a neighbouring State\nwith close relations to the parties involved, supports all\ninitiatives aimed at achieving a just settlement, based\non international law and United Nations resolutions,\nincluding the efforts of the Quartet. Such a settlement\nwould lead to both peace and stability and would\nensure normal relations and security for all the\ncountries of the region. It would also have to include\nthe fulfilment of the inalienable rights of the\nPalestinian people through the creation of their own\nState and the termination of occupation. Most\nimportantly, it would put an end to violence and\nreinforce the voices of moderation and cooperation. We\nreiterate our condemnation of all acts of terror,\nincluding suicide bombings. As in the past, we stand\nready to assist the parties in any way they feel that we\ncan contribute, including by hosting meetings on the\nisland.\nCyprus attaches great importance to the role of\nthe United Nations in the field of disarmament. It will\ntherefore continue to support international action aimed\nat strengthening multilateral instruments on\ndisarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction. In this spirit, I wish to inform the\nAssembly that the Government of the Republic of\nCyprus has recently proceeded, in cooperation with the\nUnited Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, with the\ndestruction of a significant number of weapons and has\ndecided unilaterally to demine the buffer zone.\nMoreover, Cyprus is in the final stage of ratifying the\nOttawa Convention on anti-personnel mines.\nThe general debate of this session is nearing its\nend. The distinct focus of this session has been the\ngalvanization of world opinion with respect to the\nnecessity of implementing United Nations resolutions.\nCyprus has long been advocating respect for all United\nNations resolutions, without double standards or\nexceptions. We are convinced that this would bring us\ncloser to the shared vision of collective security, peace\nand justice envisioned by the founding fathers of the\nOrganization.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMexico wishes to welcome two new Member States.\nTheir presence buttresses the universal mission of the\nUnited Nations. Our congratulations to the Democratic\nRepublic of Timor-Leste. This represents a further\nexpression of the right to self-determination and a\nreflection of its people's resolve for independence.\nAlso, we welcome the decision of the people of the\nSwiss Confederation to become a full Member of the\nUnited Nations.\nThe international community is facing a defining\nmoment. A year after the attack on the United States, in\nwhich men and women from more than 80 different\ncountries perished, we have the responsibility to decide\ntogether the direction the international system should\ntake in the coming years.\nMexico is aware of the magnitude of the\nchallenges that the Organization faces today: the\nurgency of returning a human focus to globalization, of\nfighting the poverty that divides the world, of making\npossible development that respects the environment, of\nfinding formulas for resolving the many conflicts and\nwars that now affect millions of people, of effectively\nfighting international terrorism and of guaranteeing\nrespect for the rights and fundamental freedoms of\nevery human being.\nResponding to those challenges in a responsible\nand visionary way is more important today than ever\nbefore. At the present time, anger or the inevitable\ndifficulties of consensus-building may cloud judgement\nor give rise to pressure to act precipitously or\nunilaterally. Mexico is convinced that, at this time, the\nonly legitimate path of action is that based on a\n23\n\nmultilateral approach that favours agreement and\ncollective action, for the benefit of the international\ncommunity as a whole as well as of each our nations\nindividually. Therefore, Mexico reaffirms its\ncommitment to the system of international security that\ngives the Security Council the responsibility of\nmaintaining world peace. In fulfilling that mandate, the\nCouncil must base its actions on the principles\narticulated in the Charter of the United Nations, such as\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes, which has been a\nfundamental aspiration of the community of nations\nsince the middle of the last century and is one of my\ncountry's most cherished ideals.\nMexico maintains that the Security Council is the\nproper body to adopt the measures necessary to achieve\na lasting solution to the question of Iraq. Therefore, we\nvalue the statement made yesterday by President\nGeorge Bush, which included a recognition of the\nimportance that debate and collective decision-making\nwill have in the coming days and weeks in determining\nthe path to be taken concerning Iraq. However, we\ncannot fail to recognize that the scope of action open to\nus will also involve complex challenges for Council\nmembers and for the entire international community.\nWe unequivocally condemn  as have most other\nnations  Iraq's continued non-compliance with\nCouncil resolutions concerning disarmament and the\nrenunciation of weapons of mass destruction, and we\nreaffirm the importance of that nation's immediate\ncompliance  without preconditions  with Council\nresolutions concerning the return of United Nations\ninspectors. Nevertheless, we must recognize that non-\ncompliance with United Nations resolutions has\noccurred at other junctures, at other times and in other\nplaces.\nToday, we believe it is indispensable that the\nSecurity Council have the necessary time and support\nto seek the return of the inspectors, and we therefore\nsupport President Jacques Chirac's recent proposal to\nset a specific time frame for meeting that objective.\nMoreover, as a responsible and committed Council\nmember, Mexico believes that any decision arising\nfrom possible Iraqi non-compliance with the relevant\nresolutions should be taken based on two indispensable\nconditions. First, there must be a clearer evaluation of\nIraq's true weapons capacity  including both\ntechnology and delivery systems  and of its intention\nto use them or the capacity of terrorist groups to gain\naccess to them. It could be based on reports issued by\nUnited Nations inspection mechanisms, with additional\ninformation from individual countries. Secondly, there\nmust be agreement among Council member, as well as\nother countries directly involved, on the steps that must\nbe taken in the light of the corroboration of those facts\nor in the event of Iraq's refusal to permit the return of\ninspectors to its territory.\nMexico believes that unilateral military action,\ntaken without prior consultation with the Security\nCouncil, would undermine the foundations of the new\narchitecture of international security and could affect\nthe consensus in favour of the battle against\ninternational terrorism that followed the attacks\nperpetrated a year ago against the United States.\nMexico comes before the Assembly with the\ndetermination to assume an active role in building a\nnew world order. Its willingness for dialogue with\nother nations is a reflection of the democratic change\nthat has occurred in my country, which has also given\nMexico new confidence in its ability to contribute to\nattaining the objectives of the international community.\nThe determination to play a more active role in the\nworld has led us to incorporate issues and perspectives\nwith global dimensions and impact as key elements of\nour national interests. Fostering world economic\ndevelopment, promoting and defending human rights\nand strengthening democracy and sustainable\ndevelopment are examples of our commitment, which\ntranscends borders and sovereignties. The efforts that\nwe undertake to make global ideals reality will also\nenable us to promote more vigorously our national\nvalues.\nMexico's redoubled international activity has\nbeen reflected over the past months in a series of\nactions that mark a milestone in the history of our\nforeign relations. One of our projects with greatest\nstrategic vision is the Puebla-Panama Plan, whose\nobjective is to coordinate the efforts of the public,\nsocial and private sectors of Mexico and of the Central\nAmerican countries in implementing joint development\nand investment projects.\nWith the same determination, we are promoting a\nsense of community in North America in order to\narticulate shared values towards a common vision of\nregional development that is coherent, wide-ranging\nand long-term. In that context, we believe that the\ngradual negotiation of an immigration agreement to\nbring order and legality to the movement of labour in\n24\n\nthe region is an urgent priority. From Mexico's\nstandpoint, labour flows between countries must be\nviewed as an opportunity to redirect the globalization\nprocess and to reduce the gap that separates developed\nnations from less-developed societies.\nMy country has also launched an extensive\ncampaign of cultural promotion abroad. In that way,\nMexico is seeking to present to the world the wealth,\ndiversity and vitality of its culture in order to build\nbridges with other nations and regions. The\nstrengthening of cooperation and cultural ties among\nour countries must be a priority for us all. That is why\nwe welcome the return of the United States to the\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization.\nThe international activism displayed by Mexico\nfor almost two years now has been particularly evident\nin more intense work within multilateral forums. In\ncarrying out that work, we have often been able to\nbuild on the foundations established by previous\nAdministrations. But there is undoubtedly a new spirit\nand a new purpose in the role that multilateral activism\nplays in Mexico's international strategy.\nOur most important task in the multilateral sphere\nlies here within the United Nations. The Government\nof Mexico is proud to have received the support of the\ncommunity of nations for our country's election as a\nnon-permanent member of the Security Council. In that\nand other forums, we are actively participating in the\nbuilding of a new international architecture that will\ngovern relations among nations in the coming decades.\nMexico's participation in the Asia-Pacific\nEconomic Cooperation forum  in which we have\nparticipated since 1993  is another eloquent example\nof our international activism. In October, our country\nwill host the tenth meeting of the leaders of that\nmechanism, where we shall continue to promote\nactions that foster greater prosperity for the peoples of\nthe Asia-Pacific region.\nMexico has also vigorously promoted the\nrelaunching of international economic negotiations.\nThe International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, held in March at Monterrey, promoted a\nbroad and inclusive alliance among States and\ninternational organizations that should make possible a\nhigher level of financing for development, with a clear\nbalance between national responsibilities and\ninternational cooperation. Today, the Monterrey\nConsensus is the basis for redirecting globalization\ntowards growth and anti-poverty objectives, and it is\nthe ideal tool for placing development priorities at the\ncentre of the international agenda.\nFrom Mexico's standpoint, the Monterrey\nConference forms part of a coherent series of\ninternational summits devoted to promoting the agenda\nof world development. That process began last year in\nDoha with the Fourth Ministerial Meeting of the World\nTrade Organization (WTO); it grew in strength by\nincorporating the environmental dimension of\nsustainable development in Johannesburg, and it will\ncontinue with the holding of the Fifth Ministerial\nMeeting of the WTO in Canc\u02d9n, Mexico, next year.\nThe close interrelationship among all the issues related\nto development was also apparent at the recent\nJohannesburg Summit, where the positions that\nPresident Vicente Fox put forward on behalf of Mexico\nwere widely supported and recognized.\nMindful of the new threats to international\nsecurity, the Mexican Government has also called for\nthe security arrangements of the Americas to be\nupdated. We have offered to host a special conference\non security to be convened at the third Summit of the\nAmericas, to take place in Mexico in May 2003.\nNotwithstanding the importance of all these\nactions, Mexico's new role at the international level is\nparticularly evident in our promotion of human rights\nand democracy. My country has stated its conviction\nthat human rights represent absolute and universal\nvalues and that, as such, the obligation to uphold them\nis a duty shared by all Governments and peoples,\nirrespective of borders and sovereignties. Moreover, we\nhave been consistent in these convictions. That is why,\ndespite the mixed reaction that it has generated in\nMexico, given the strong bonds of friendship that\nMexican society has always enjoyed with several\nnations close to us, we have been compelled to express\nour concern about the human rights situation in those\ncountries. One of the most far-reaching steps we have\ntaken to demonstrate our commitment to the cause of\nhuman rights is the harmonization of Mexican\nlegislation with international instruments that protect\nsuch rights. We have placed particular emphasis on the\nprotection of such vulnerable groups as women,\nchildren, indigenous peoples and the disabled.\nAt the same time, we have abandoned the\ndefensive attitude that prevented us from entering into\n25\n\ndialogue with other nations and multilateral\norganizations dedicated to the protection of human\nrights. Upon the invitation of the Mexican\nGovernment, many representatives of international\nhuman rights organizations have visited our country. In\nthe same spirit of openness, the Mexican Government\nsigned a framework agreement with the Office of the\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nIn the context of efforts of the Mexican\nGovernment to strengthen the rule of law, the Mexican\nSenate is currently considering a draft constitutional\namendment that would allow our country to ratify the\nRome Statute creating the International Criminal Court.\nThis amendment would involve recognition of the\njurisdiction of international courts created by treaties to\nwhich Mexico is party and ensure compliance with\ntheir resolutions and rulings. The amendment\nrepresents a decisive step towards incorporating and\nensuring the effectiveness of the standards of\ninternational law at the domestic level. Mexico\nwelcomes the recent entry into force of the\nInternational Criminal Court, which reflects the resolve\nof the community of nations to create an international\nsystem based on universal standards.\nWe believe, however, that the signing of\nagreements by those seeking to prevent a given\ncategory of persons from being subject to the\njurisdiction of the International Criminal Court\nrepresents a grave step backwards for international law.\nIt threatens the universal scope of the provisions of the\nRome Statute, distorts the spirit that led to its creation\nand undermines the efforts of the community of States\nto eliminate impunity in the cases of extremely serious\ncrimes. We appeal to the members of the international\ncommunity to assist in strengthening the authority of\nthe International Criminal Court, which it has spent so\nmuch time and effort to build.\nThe defence of human rights necessarily involves\nthe promotion of democratic freedoms. Today, we are\nseeing increasingly widespread recognition of the fact\nthat representative democracy, with its institutional\nframework of parties, groups and civil society\norganizations, as well as the legal framework\nsafeguarding the civil freedoms of association and\nspeech, constitutes the best way of reconciling the\nlegitimate exercise of authority with respect to those\nfreedoms that are essential to human beings. Mexico's\nactive part in drafting the Inter-American Democratic\nCharter, which was signed by the nations of the\nAmerican continent in September 2001, is another\nexample of my country's commitment to democratic\nprinciples. At the same, we are successfully promoting\ndemocratic values in other regions, as demonstrated by\nour work within the Community of Democracies,\nwhose second conference is scheduled to be held in\nNovember.\nThe adherence of the Mexican Government and\nMexican society to human rights and democracy has\ntwo mutually complementary aspects. On the one hand,\nit means strengthening democratic practices and\ninstitutions and human rights throughout the country, to\nwhich end we are restoring the effectiveness of the rule\nof law; on the other, it compels us to engage in more\nvigorous activism in international forums so that we\nmay encourage full respect for human rights and\ndemocracy throughout the world. This will enable us\nmore firmly to consolidate human rights and\ndemocracy in Mexico, so that the democratic change\nthat we have experienced can become irreversible.\nI am here today to state that my country has\nreturned with renewed energy to the international\nscene. The Mexican Government has moved from\ndefensive aloofness to constructive dialogue, and from\nlimited international legitimacy to the exercise of\ndiplomacy based on democratic principles and\nunqualified respect for human rights. The kind of world\nwe wish to create and the steps we are willing to\ntake  or to refrain from taking  in order to achieve\nit are questions that we cannot evade at this critical\nmoment of international redefinition. Mexico reaffirms\nits conviction that action based on principles and\nagreements must take precedence over the temptations\nof unilateralism and that universal standards must\nprevail over short-term interests. Mexico's\ninternational activism, in particular its commitment to\nhuman rights and democracy, reflects the belief of the\nMexican nation in the essential equality of all human\nbeings and in the duties that it entails for all our\npeoples and Governments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me begin\nby welcoming Switzerland, our western neighbour, as a\nfull member of the United Nations and her first\nparticipation in the General Assembly after her\naccession. Without our Swiss friends the United\nNations would not be complete. Expanding the global\nreach of the United Nations can be seen as a positive\naspect of globalization.\nHaving supported United Nations efforts to bring\nabout a solution to the East Timor conflict for many\nyears, Austria also looks forward to 27 September and\nwishes to congratulate East Timor on becoming the\n191st Member of the United Nations.\nAustria fully aligns itself with the statement made\nby the Prime Minister of Denmark on behalf of the\nEuropean Union. I should like to add a few\nobservations to that very comprehensive statement.\nLet me reiterate the sympathy of the Austrian\npeople for the victims of 11 September 2001. Austria\nhas shown strong solidarity from the first hour after the\nattacks and has acted in unison with her European\npartners and the United Nations to combat terrorism \u2014\na resolve that remains strong and will continue to do\nso.\nAs a former staff member of the United Nations, I\nwish to convey my country's sincere gratitude to the\nmany dedicated people who are in the service of the\nUnited Nations in New York and at the other\nheadquarters in Vienna and Geneva, as well as out\nthere in the field, for their efforts on behalf of the\ninternational community in its fight against terror.\nCombating terrorism requires a global effort and\na comprehensive approach: prevention and the\nprotection of the security of our countries and of the\nbasic values of freedom and human rights, as well as\ncoercive measures as a last resort. We must, however,\nbase our decisions and actions on international law.\nThe Security Council's Counter-Terrorism Committee\n(CTC) under the very able leadership of Sir Jeremy\nGreenstock, Ambassador of the United Kingdom, is at\nthe core of the United Nations coordinating role.\nWe must ensure that all States join and can join\nthose efforts. To promote that goal, Austria hosted a\nsymposium on combating international terrorism at the\nVienna International Centre in June of this year, which\nhighlighted the capacity of the Vienna-based United\nNations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention\n(ODCCP) to provide efficient technical assistance to\nMember States in their fight against terrorism. Austria\nwill make an additional million euros available for the\nstrengthening of the ODCCP.\nI am glad to note that Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan shares our view on the importance of the\nVienna-based United Nations units, as expressed in his\nreport on the need to strengthen the Terrorism\nPrevention Branch of the Secretariat. The report of\nPolicy Working Group on the United Nations and\nTerrorism published earlier this week comes to the\nsame conclusion. I therefore call upon the Member\nStates to support that position.\nIt is also important to remind ourselves that the\nfight against terrorism cannot be fought with soldiers\nand policemen alone; we also need to fight the root\ncauses: the abject levels of poverty, inequality,\n16\n\ninjustice, the lack of sustainable development and of\ngood governance.\nWhen it comes to dangers for world security, we\nalso have to focus on unresolved and perilous regional\nconflicts, such as in the Middle East. What is needed is\nan effort to speedily arrive at a political solution\nproviding for two States, Israel and Palestine, within\nsecure and recognized borders. Austria seconds the\nidea of an early international conference with the\nsupport of the Quartet and interested countries of the\nregion aimed at finding solutions to the political issues\nsuch as the final borders of the two States, the final\nstatus of Jerusalem and the question of refugees.\nAustria considers the newly designed road map of the\nEuropean Union towards the establishment of an\nindependent and sovereign Palestinian State in the next\nthree years to be a good basis for achieving a final and\ncomprehensive settlement of the conflict in accordance\nwith Security Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338\n(1973) and 1397 (2002), taking into consideration the\nArab peace plan adopted in Beirut as well.\nWhile continuing to respect the elected leadership\nof the Palestinian people the European Union has\nexpressed its readiness to give all necessary and\npossible support to the reform process of the\nPalestinian Authority. Austria participates actively in\nthose efforts. Austria is also deeply concerned that\nhuman suffering in the conflict has attained\nunacceptable levels, be it as a result of terror or of\ncountermeasures.\nThe Middle East has also garnered the attention\nof the international community in the context of the\ndanger of the proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction. The growing tensions result from the\ncontinued non-compliance with United Nations\nSecurity Council resolutions on the part of Iraq. The\npotential threat of weapons of mass destruction\nendangering world peace through such policies should\nnot and cannot be tolerated. For that reason Austria\nsupports the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General to\nbring about the speedy, unfettered and unconditional\nreturn of United Nations weapons inspectors to Iraq,\nalong with full compliance with the obligations\ncontained in all relevant Security Council resolutions.\nAustria welcomes the statement of President\nGeorge Bush seeking broad international and\nmultilateral support and cooperation with the Security\nCouncil on the issue of how to deal with the threat\nemanating from regimes that support terror or seek to\nacquire weapons of mass destruction. Only the Security\nCouncil can provide the legitimacy we need. At the\nsame time, it is evident that the Security Council itself\nhas to take responsibility for ensuring full compliance\nwith its resolutions in order to maintain world peace.\nThe conflict between India and Pakistan over the\nissue of Kashmir also needs an urgent political\nsolution. The consequences of an escalation could be\ncatastrophic for the region and beyond.\nIn recent weeks, we have been starkly reminded\nof the fact that Afghanistan, which has been wrested\nfrom Taliban and Al Qaeda rule and has had a\npromising new start with the assistance of the\ninternational community, has yet to achieve a lasting\npeace and stability. The international community\nshould remain committed and has to continue its\nsupport of the new Government of Afghanistan.\nThe fight against terrorism and violent\nfundamentalism in Afghanistan has also highlighted the\nimportance of the whole region of Central Asia. During\nits chairmanship of the Organization for Security and\nCooperation in Europe in 2000, Austria made it a\npriority to draw the attention of world opinion to the\nunresolved issues and problems and to the very\nimpressive potential of that region given mutually\nuseful cooperation and good governance.\nTurning to our own neighbourhood, I want to\nreiterate the importance Austria attributes to European\nUnion enlargement and our firm commitment to\nfinalizing the ongoing negotiating process towards the\nend of this year. Austria looks forward to welcoming\nnew members by 2004, thus turning the vision of a\nunited Europe into reality and extending the European\nzone of peace, stability and welfare to the whole\ncontinent and beyond.\nI am glad to note that South-Eastern Europe has\nmade substantial progress towards stability generated\nby various multilateral initiatives, particularly the\nStability Pact for South-Eastern Europe and the Zagreb\nprocess. As an additional instrument for enhancing\ndevelopment in that region, in May of this year the\nDanube Cooperation Project was launched in Vienna,\nthe aim of which is to make use of the Danube River as\nan integrative factor connecting the 13 countries of the\nwhole Danube basin.\n17\n\nThe dialogue among civilizations, which Austria\nhas strongly supported from the beginning, is a new\nand important tool of diplomacy that should help us\ndrain the breeding grounds of terrorism. In order to\ntake this dialogue from the elites to the general public,\nwe need to cooperate with the media. To that end, I\norganized an expert seminar on the role of the media in\nthe framework of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership\nin June of this year. This effort is designed to lead,\nhopefully, to a media code of conduct to emanate from\nthe media themselves in order to create better\nunderstanding between the cultures and commonly to\nproject messages shedding a positive light on cultural\ndiversity.\nAs of July of this year, Austria has chaired the\nHuman Security Network, the only interregional\ngrouping in the United Nations framework particularly\npropelling issues of human security. In my capacity as\nChairperson of that group, I have put the following two\nissues at the top of our agenda: the needs for a globally\nshared acquisition of a human rights culture through\nhuman rights education and for effectively addressing\nthe terrible plight suffered by an ever-growing number\nof children in the world exposed to the horrors of\narmed conflict. The first \u201chuman rights city\u201d in Europe,\nthe Austrian city of Graz, will also host next year's\nministerial meeting of the Human Security Network. In\nthis context I should also like to express Austria's\nstrong support for the adoption of the draft protocol of\nthe Convention against Torture and Other Cruel,\nInhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\nIn my function as President of the Human\nSecurity Network, I have also taken the initiative, in\nthe framework of the group of female foreign\nministers, to raise the issue of Amina Lawal in a\ncommon letter to the Foreign Minister of Nigeria in\norder to remind Nigeria of its obligations under\ninternational human rights law.\nIn the Millennium Declaration, we set clear\ntargets for our combined development efforts as\nMember States. We all did this in recognition of the\npriority attached to the fight against poverty and for a\nbetter and more equitable world. Disastrous floods in\nparts of Central Europe, including my own country, in\nAsia and the Americas, as well as droughts in other\nparts of the world just before the start of the World\nSummit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg,\nwere a painful indication of changes rendering\nsustainable development even more important. The\nSummit brought about an action programme and a\npolitical declaration, which we welcome, although we\nwould have wished to take some issues even further,\nsuch as in the field of renewable energy. I share the\nview of the Secretary-General that the Summit has\ninstigated global action among a wide range of actors.\nIt has highlighted the relationship between economy,\necology, social issues and development. It has also\nreaffirmed the Doha and Monterrey compromises.\nThe follow-up will have to cut through the\ncomplexities of the process and to pursue the most\npressing issues. Implementation is the key word. This\nwill be best accomplished by sectoral conferences on\nthe major issues involved. Austria appreciates that the\nSummit has helped convince some major countries to\njoin the ranks of those, such as Austria, that have\nalready ratified the Kyoto Protocol.\nBefore closing, let me express my best wishes for\na successful session of the Assembly under\nMr. Kavan's guidance and allow me also to thank his\npredecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, for his leadership and\nhis efforts towards strengthening the General\nAssembly.\nHaving returned deeply impressed from South\nAfrica, let me close by quoting a real hero and a man\nwho stands for his principles while promoting\nreconciliation \u2014 Mr. Nelson Mandela. The following\nquote is from the entrance to the Apartheid Museum in\nJohannesburg, which I just visited: \u201cTo be free is not\nmerely to put off one's chains, but to live in a way that\nrespects and enhances the freedom of others.\u201d\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOne year has passed since the tragic events\nthat took place on 11 September 2001 in the United\nStates of America shook the world and demonstrated\nthe magnitude and brutality of the global threat of\ninternational terrorism. During the past year the world\nbecame fully aware of the challenges that humankind\nwas facing as we entered the twenty-first century. It\nwas a year during which the international community\ncame together and began to take decisive action against\nterrorism.\nWhile paying tribute to the memory of all of the\nvictims of the terrorism that has left a bloody trail\nthroughout the world, we must now take stock of the\ninitial results of the joint anti-terrorist campaign and,\nmost important, outline our objectives in strengthening\nthe foundations of international security and stability.\nThe most important outcome of the coming\ntogether of States to achieve common goals \nunprecedented since the Second World War  is clear\ntoday. A broad international anti-terrorist coalition has\nbeen established and is actively functioning; it has\nalready demonstrated its effectiveness in Afghanistan,\na country that international terrorists of various\naffiliations had transformed into their own personal\nlair. Our common objective is not only to preserve the\nexperience of interaction acquired within the\nframework of the coalition  avoiding such unilateral\nactions as might undermine it  but also to transform\nthe anti-terrorist alliance into a supportive mechanism\nof effective security and cooperation for the new\nmillennium.\nThe United Nations must certainly be a pivotal\nelement of such a mechanism. Indeed, the United\nNations is called upon to continue to guarantee that, in\ncombating new threats and challenges, the efforts of\n20\n\nthe international community rest on a solid basis of\ninternational law.\nWe must acknowledge  and the past year has\nbeen very instructive in this regard  that a great deal\nof hard work awaits us. It will be possible to put\ninsurmountable obstacles in the way of fanatics and\nextremists who spread death and destruction only if we\ncan reach general agreement on core issues relating to\nthe world order. In this context, the role of the United\nNations is, indeed, irreplaceable.\nThe fact that the process of implementing the\nfundamental anti-terrorist resolution  Security\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001)  is under way is of\ncritical importance. That resolution is binding on all\nStates, and we must now seek to achieve its\nunconditional implementation by all States.\nA priority task in the war on terrorism is the\nstrengthening of its international legal framework. First\nand foremost, there is a need to ensure the genuinely\nuniversal character of existing anti-terrorist\nconventions.\nHaving ratified the 1999 Convention for the\nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism, Russia is\nnow completing the process of accession to those\ninternational instruments. At the same time, we are\nseriously concerned about the lack of real progress in\nnegotiating a comprehensive convention on combating\nterrorism and a convention on the suppression of acts\nof nuclear terrorism.\nThe well-known differences in the approaches of\nStates to the provisions of such instruments could\ncertainly be fully reconciled. They should not\novershadow the objective, which is pressing for all of\nus, of establishing a legal basis to counter terrorism in\nall its manifestations  a basis that would be in\nkeeping with the realities of today's world. Russia is\ncontinuing to make resolute efforts to achieve that\nobjective.\nIt is the obligation of all States to protect the\nrights and freedoms of their citizens, the most\nimportant of these being the right to life. But it is\nprecisely the lives of ordinary people that are\nthreatened by terrorists, and each year new names are\nadded to the list of victims. The international\ncommunity can no longer tolerate this. It is our\nobligation to provide our citizens with the right to\nreliable protection against terrorism.\nSuch an objective can be achieved only if all\nStates agree on a range of specific measures under\nUnited Nations auspices. There is now a need to draw\nup an effective code to protect human rights against\nterrorism. Some of these measures have already been\ndiscussed by the international community, including in\nthis forum. Others will require consideration in a\nbroader context. The most important consideration,\nhowever, is that we should agree on a unified system of\nvalues and measures shared by all States.\nThe results of the war against terrorism will be\ntangible only if we act in concert at all levels  global,\nregional and national. The anti-terrorist cooperation\nmechanisms aimed at preventing the spread of\nterrorism in Central Asia, including those within the\nframework of the Commonwealth of Independent\nStates and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, are\ngaining momentum and thus provide clear evidence of\nthat fact. There is a great deal of potential in the new\npartnership between Russia and the countries of the\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization.\nThe field of anti-terrorism is an integral part of\nour continuous dialogue and cooperation with the\nleading countries of the world, including the United\nStates, China, India and the States members of the\nEuropean Union. We are confident that the\ndevelopment of such interaction at many levels will\npromote a climate of confidence, security and\ncooperation in all parts of the world.\nThe stability and credibility of the emerging\ninternational system of the twenty-first century will\ndepend directly on the maintenance and strengthening\nof strategic stability. This fundamental objective was\nadvanced by the signing, by the Presidents of Russia\nand of the United States, at their May meeting in\nMoscow, of the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty,\nwhich was a specific, major contribution by the leading\nnuclear Powers to nuclear disarmament.\nIt is also very important to ensure the non-\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The\ndanger of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons or\ntheir components falling into the irresponsible hands of\nterrorists increases international terrorism's potential to\ncause devastation. This means that there is a need to\nstep up efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation\nregime for weapons of mass destruction and their\ndelivery vehicles.\n21\n\nBy acting jointly and responsibly, we have\nalready achieved a great deal. When we speak about\nthe establishment of new regimes for the non-\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and for\narms control, we by no means wish to imply a\nrenunciation of regimes and agreements already in\neffect. They are our shared protective mechanism  a\nmechanism that is very reliable and has stood the test\nof time. Unjustified removal of the key elements of the\ninternational legal framework of non-proliferation can\naggravate the international military and strategic\nsituation and undermine global security.\nFurthermore, we should universalize' the most\nimportant agreements on non-proliferation of nuclear\nweapons and on comprehensive nuclear test ban. The\nmissile sphere needs a sustainable negotiating process\naimed at concluding an international arrangement on a\nglobal regime of missile and missile technology non-\nproliferation.\nThe prevention of the deployment of weapons in\nouter space forms an integral part of the non-\nproliferation process. Together with a number of our\npartners we suggest that a comprehensive agreement be\nworked out aimed at preserving outer space as a zone\nfree from any kind of weapons. We are confident that\nthis proposal serves the interests of all States, and\nexpect that it will enjoy wide support.\nSince its establishment, the United Nations has\nbeen engaged in the settlement of regional conflicts.\nThose so-called local problems have long turned into\none of the main threats to international stability.\nTerrorism, political extremism, and economic and\nsocial degradation are their customary companions.\nCertainly, the primary responsibility in any settlement\nrests with the relevant parties, but multilateral\nmechanisms have also repeatedly demonstrated their\neffectiveness in the restoration of peace and concord. A\ntangible progress made with the United Nations visible\ninvolvement in the post-Taliban reconstruction of\nAfghanistan is one of our common accomplishments.\nWe can add to this the adoption by the United Nations\nSecurity Council of major practical decisions in\nsupport of a comprehensive settlement in the Middle\nEast and the resolution of crises in a number of African\ncountries.\nAnd yet, we are still far from a radical decrease in\nthe number and intensity of armed conflicts. Hard\nwork, requiring great human as well as material and\nfinancial resources, is awaiting us. But the most\nimportant here is the presence of a strong political will\nto implement the provisions of the United Nations\nCharter pertaining to the peaceful settlement of\ndisputes.\nExperience shows that no matter how complex\ninternational crises and conflicts may be, whatever\nchallenges and threats they may be fraught with, they\ncan be settled with the aid of United Nations\ninstruments and on the basis of international law. This\nfully applies to the situation around Iraq, which has\nlong required political settlement in strict compliance\nwith the Security Council resolutions.\nThe entire international community benefits from\na steady enhancement of the leading role of our\nOrganization in peacemaking. We cannot relax our\nattention to this task.\nAt all times and throughout the world, terrorism\nand extremism have tried to justify themselves with\ncontinuous social and economic instability and poverty.\nWhile recognizing the existence of these serious\nproblems we should state most resolutely that terrorism\ndoes not and will not have any justification. At the\nsame time, the creation of a sustainable and fair global\nfinancial and economic structure would, certainly, help\ncombat many dangerous challenges to mankind. The\nlatest major international forums  the International\nConference on Financing for Development\nin Monterey, World Food Summit in Rome,\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development in\nJohannesburg  adopted decisions designed to uproot\nthe causes of the most threatening disparities in the\nworld. The next step is to implement the agreements\nwe have reached.\nEqually sweeping are the tasks that face us in the\nfield of environmental protection. Natural disasters that\nafflicted many regions of our planet this summer have\ndemonstrated again that the solution of environmental\nissues cannot be put off unless we want to endanger the\nvery survival of future generations. This sphere also\ndepends on multilateral efforts that exclude the egoism\nof individual States.\nThe initiative of Russian President Vladimir V.\nPutin on holding in autumn 2003 a World Conference\non Climate Change in Moscow is designed to\ncoordinate our efforts in this field.\n22\n\nA year ago, the Russian Federation called on the\ninternational community from the podium of the\nUnited Nations General Assembly to create a global\nsystem of counteraction to present-day threats and\nchallenges that would be aimed at tackling real issues\nin the sphere of security and at meeting the vital\ninterests of each and every State. This system would\nprovide for long-term international stability and\nsustainable development.\nTo be efficient, such a system needs a generally\nrecognized coordinating centre capable of rallying the\ninternational community. And we do have such a\ncentre  the United Nations with its unique\nlegitimacy, universality and experience. Our common\ntask is to unite around the United Nations to provide it\nwith the necessary potential and resources and to\ndevelop as much as possible its internal reserves.\nToday, we can state with satisfaction that the\nglobal system is already evolving and the beginning of\nthis process is largely successful. We suggest that an\nadditional impetus should be given to this process and\na resolution to encourage a most prompt creation of a\nglobal system of counteraction to present-day threats\nand challenges should be adopted at this session of the\nGeneral Assembly. By doing so, we will direct all\nStates towards the joint elaboration of its general shape\nand parameters. This is even more relevant because\nsome of its parameters are already visible.\nIt is apparent that the system to be created must\nbe:\n\u00f1 Global, as modern challenges in the context of\nglobalization pose a universal threat, and should\nbe addressed at the global level.\n\u00f1 Comprehensive in scope, as each of the modern\nthreats bears a huge destructive potential and all\nsuch problems without exceptions should be\nembraced by the system.\n\u00f1 Holistic in approach, as quite often the new\nthreats and challenges are directly interrelated.\n\u00f1 Universal in participation.\nFinally, the system should become a reflection of\nthe international rule of law, as its power will be built\non principles and regulations of international law, the\nUnited Nations Charter above all.\nWe bear grave responsibility to future\ngenerations, and the model of world order we will\nestablish is destined to influence the life on our planet\nfor decades. As for Russia, we have made our choice.\nThis is the choice in favour of a democratic, multi-\npolar world order, which would guarantee sustainable\ndevelopment and equal security for all States; a world\norder formed on the basis of the extensive structure of\nmultilateral institutions integrated within the\nframework of the United Nations.\nWe hope that the decisions of this General\nAssembly session will mark an important stage of this\nprocess.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIn a year\nof frightful tragedy and uncertainty, we were at least\nfortunate to have the charisma and leadership of Mr.\nHan Seung-soo, as President of the fifty-sixth session\nof the General Assembly. We also take this opportunity,\nMr. President, to warmly congratulate you. We\nwelcome the admission of the Swiss Confederation to\nthe United Nations family, and we are pleased at the\nfuture status of East Timor.\nUnder the enlightened leadership of Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, the United Nations has rediscovered its\nrelevance and its credibility. The reform measures he\nhas implemented in recent years have enabled better\ncoordination, better information-sharing, strengthened\ncohesion and a stronger strategic direction. Today the\nUnited Nations is working more and more closely with\ncivil society to fight disease, address the challenges of\npoverty and respond to humanitarian crises. The\nOrganization has also built a meaningful partnership\nwith private sector enterprises, aimed at having\ndeveloping countries benefit from their expertise and\nresources.\nIn that regard, the Monterrey International\nConference on Financing for Development and the\nWorld Summit on Social Development, held in\nJohannesburg, have highlighted the unprecedented\ncollaboration of various decision-makers, such as the\nUnited Nations, Governments, the private sector,\ninternational financial institutions and civil society.\nLast week, during numerous commemorative\nceremonies marking the horrible events of 11\nSeptember 2001, it was obvious that the world had\nbeen left traumatized. The reverberations of 11\nSeptember are still palpable throughout the United\nNations system and the world. Indeed, within less than\n24 hours, the Security Council took decisive action,\n12\n\ndeclaring that the 11 September attacks posed a threat\nto international peace and security. The important\nresolution on the fight against terrorism, Security\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001), established a general\nprocedure for verifying that every country is\nimplementing the relevant provisions of the resolution,\nin order to eradicate that scourge.\nOur resolve and determination to fight the threat\nof terrorism has undoubtedly been strengthened. The\nevent itself alerted us to understanding and perceiving\ncertain basic truths: human vulnerability and\ninterdependence, the mobilization of a real\ninternational coalition in a short time, if need be, and\nour common resolve to eradicate the criminals who\ntake innocent life, regardless of nationality, religion,\nsex and colour.\nPresiding over the official ceremonies marking\nthe anniversary at the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nthe Secretary-General, said that:\n\u201cEverything that we work for \u2014 peace,\ndevelopment, health, freedom \u2014 is damaged by\nthis horror. Everything that we believe in \u2014\nrespect for human life, justice, tolerance,\npluralism and democracy \u2014 is threatened by it. It\nmust be defeated \u2014 and it must be defeated by a\nworld acting as one.\u201d (SG/SM/8376, para. 7)\nTherefore, combating terrorism requires more\naggressive law enforcement measures everywhere.\nIn order to eradicate that horror, almost all\ncountries have initiated an extraordinary series of\nactions, which have converged towards a complete\nreorientation of their policies, and particularly their\nforeign policies.\nWe have witnessed countries pursuing policies to\nreach out to others, to strengthen ties, to share global\nvisions and to forge new strategic alliances. There is no\ndoubt that the events of 11 September 2001 have led to\nthe forming of new alliances and the strengthening of\nexisting ones. However, it should not be a surprise that\nthis has also generated stricter controls on the\nmovements of people, particularly people of certain\nreligions, backgrounds, complexions and regions.\nThere is no doubt that we are living in a dangerous\nworld in which vigilance is called for. However, while\ntaking all that into account, let us be careful not to\ndebase our grief for the victims and their families. As\nan editorial in a well respected newspaper stated:\n\u201cWhat happened a year ago was terrible, but\nour shock and our respect for the suffering of\nthose left behind should not cloud our judgement\nabout unrelated issues\u201d. (The Independent,\n11 September 2002)\nIn the Secretary-General's words of 11 September\n2002, on the first anniversary of that unspeakable\ntragedy:\n\u201cToday, we come together as a world community\nbecause we were attacked as a world community.\n\u201c...\n\u201cMay the memory of those who perished on 11\nSeptember serve to inspire a better, more just,\nmore peaceful world for all of us\u201d. (Press release\nSG/SM/8376)\nWe hope that reason will prevail over fear, prejudice\nand hatred.\nWe welcome President Bush's commitment to\nexplore fully the route of the Security Council in\nfinding a way to draw Iraq towards a peaceful\nsettlement of the outstanding issues. We also welcome\nIraq's unconditional agreement to the return of the\nUnited Nations inspectors. That demonstrates its\nreadiness and full cooperation in the implementation of\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions. It is, indeed,\nan encouraging development. We must dedicate\nourselves to seeking a political solution within the\nframework of the United Nations. And the United\nNations must act, and act very quickly, to put an end to\nthe acute crisis which threatens to engulf an entire\nregion and which could have an impact on the whole\nworld. We all know the consequences of this crisis. Let\nus join together and work with determination to save\nthe region, which is already in turmoil, from further\nconflict.\nOne of the gravest yet often overlooked threats to\nworld peace is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The\nRepublic of Djibouti agrees with the Secretary-General\nthat the route to peace in the Middle East was laid out\ndecades ago in Security Council resolutions 242\n(1967), 338 (1973), and, recently, in resolution 1397\n(2002), which stipulated the conditions of land for\npeace, an end to terror and to occupation and two\nStates, Palestine and Israel, living side by side within\nsecure and recognized borders. Unfortunately, the\nfocus has been shifted again by demands for a\nleadership change in the Palestinian Authority and for\n13\n\npolitical and security reforms, while simultaneously\neasing Israel's obligation to return to the negotiating\ntable. The so-called sequential approach has always\nfailed. It is urgent to move forward on all the issues,\ncomprehensively and simultaneously.\nTo the political impasse should be added the\neconomic destruction that has resulted from the\ninsurmountable checkpoints, roadblocks, repeated\nincursions and the demolition of buildings and supply\nnetworks. The Palestinian people are in danger; a\nwhole nation is virtually living in a prison. There is a\ngrowing, unprecedented humanitarian crisis, as stressed\nby a number of recent reports, describing in detail the\nlevels of malnutrition, the drop-off in child\nimmunization programmes, the increased risk of\ncommunicable diseases and runaway, endemic poverty.\nWe remain steadfast in our condemnation of the\nviolence and the killing of innocent civilians, whether\nthey be Palestinians or Israelis. In this context, we\nwelcome the latest plan of the Quartet, which outlines a\nthree-phase road map to a comprehensive final\nsettlement within a three-year period ending in 2005.\nTo complete the process of bringing peace to the\nMiddle East, Syria and Israel must reach an agreement\non Israel's withdrawal to the borders of 1967.\nA decade ago, the United Nations Conference on\nClimate and Development, held at Rio in 1992, gave us\nAgenda 21, which contains pertinent recommendations\nfor lessening our wasteful consumer habits, protecting\nthe atmosphere and the oceans, promoting sustainable\nagriculture and combating poverty. The subsequent\nthematic conferences further strengthened and\nbroadened those recommendations, which have led to\nthe promises set out in the Millennium Declaration,\nparticularly on alleviating endemic and severe poverty.\nThe goals, targets, commitments and deadlines for\nreducing poverty provide a new, decisive impetus. The\nrecent World Summit on Sustainable Development,\nheld in Johannesburg, made important and significant\nprogress on crucial issues facing humankind today.\nAll those demonstrations of goodwill, however,\nneed to be backed by concrete action. Speaking on\nbehalf of the European Union during this General\nAssembly debate, the Prime Minister of Denmark\nexpressed that sentiment:\n\u201cAt Doha, Monterrey and Johannesburg, we\nreached consensus on what needs to be done. But\nknowing what has to be done is not enough. As\nworld leaders, we must see that it is done\u201d.\n(A/57/PV.2)\nIn an increasingly demanding world, more and\nmore references are made to good governance,\ninvestment in human capital and economic freedom as\nconditions for developing countries to qualify for\ndevelopment assistance. For its part, Africa has\nacknowledged to its partners the need to enhance the\ncontinent's responsibility in all areas of concern,\nincluding peace, stability, democracy, human rights and\ndevelopment. Through the New Partnership for\nAfrica's Development, Africa has shown that it is able\nto shoulder greater collective responsibility in\nresolving its conflicts and in its development. In return,\nAfrica keenly hopes that the financial constraints that\nhave seriously hindered development and human\ndignity will be duly taken into account by our partners.\nThe issue of HIV/AIDS is one of the major\nconcerns of our continent. More than 30 million people\nare infected in the world, and 75 per cent of those are\nAfricans. The impact on development is disastrous.\nLife expectancy has decreased in some countries.\nRemarks made by the Executive Director of the Joint\nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS are very\nclear:\n\u201cIf people are not alive, if people are not\nhealthy \u2014 the people who are supposed to bring\nus sustainable development \u2014 then it won't\nhappen. AIDS is a major crisis of human\nresources.\u201d\nBased on the outcome of the peace and\nreconciliation conference held at Arta, Djibouti, our\nsubregional organization, the Intergovernmental\nAuthority on Development (IGAD), is working to\norganize a conference to bring together the national\ntransition Government and other parties in Somalia \u2014\nthe regional administrations, factions and groups that\nopted to stay away from that historic meeting. The\nfront-line States, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya, were\nmandated by the Ninth IGAD Summit of Heads of\nState and Government, held in January, to bring all of\nthe components together with a view to completing the\nArta process and thus paving the way for the\nemergence of a broad-based Government. Much has\nbeen accomplished, but it is fair to state that an\nenormous amount remains to be done.\nThe Republic of Djibouti believes that a realistic\nroad map, consistent with current thinking is a capital\n14\n\nnecessity. The majority view of the international\ncommunity \u2014 including the United Nations, the\nAfrican Union, the League of Arab States, the\nOrganization of the Islamic Conference, IGAD and the\nEuropean Union \u2014 is that the Arta peace process\nremains the most viable basis for peace and national\nreconciliation in Somalia. There has been a willingness\nto complete, without preconditions, the Arta peace and\nreconciliation process. Without ambiguity, the\ninternational community has consistently called for\ndialogue involving the national transition Government\nand the other parties, in a spirit of mutual respect and\ntolerance, with a view to establishing an inclusive\nGovernment in Somalia based on power sharing\nthrough a democratic process. Those are cardinal\nprinciples that should keep us on the right path. We\ncannot permit ourselves to stray from them.\nDecisions related to the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security lie with the Security\nCouncil, which, despite the exponential increase of\nUnited Nations membership over the past three\ndecades, has singularly remained an unrepresentative\nbody. If confidence is to be placed in its decisions,\nthere must also be an expansion in both the permanent\nand the non-permanent member categories, giving both\ndeveloped and developing countries the opportunity to\nbecome permanent members. The Working Group\ncharged with studying that issue has thus far failed to\narrive at a satisfactory conclusion, and we see no clear\nprospect of the impasse being broken soon. More\nobjectivity and clarity of vision are required in order to\nbring about that vital necessity.\nOver the past decades, the people of the Horn of\nAfrica have had their share of difficulties and\nsuffering, and we are anxious to see peace,\ndevelopment and a reduction in conflict. For its part,\nmy country, the Republic of Djibouti, is firmly\nconvinced of the merit of good-neighbourly relations,\ncooperation and the creation of opportunities for the\nbenefit of our peoples. We are resolutely committed to\nwork hand in hand with our international partners in\ngeneral, and with our friends in the region in particular,\nto resolve all outstanding issues that compromise trust\nand harmony.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the\nIndonesian delegation, I am pleased to congratulate\nyou on your election as President of the fifty-seventh\nsession of the General Assembly. We are sure that with\nyour wise and skilful guidance our deliberations will be\nfruitful.\nLet me also take this opportunity to extend\nIndonesia's warm welcome and congratulations to the\nnewest Member of this world Organization \u2014\nSwitzerland. We look forward to extending a similar\nwelcome to East Timor when it joins our Organization\nin the days ahead.\nIn November 2001, from this same podium, I\nasserted that in order to wage an effective struggle\nagainst the multiple threats and challenges confronting\nhumankind, we must imbue ourselves with the\ndemocratic spirit. Without that spirit, we can only fail.\nIn the relations and interactions among nations,\nthe democratic spirit is put into practice through\nmultilateralism. Multilateralism exists when a group of\nnations adopts a set of goals and each individual\nmember is equally responsible for the achievement of\nthose goals. It entails respect for one another's\nsensitivities and points of view, and therefore requires\ndiscussion and the forging of consensus. For the value\n7\n\nof each nation, no matter how small or how poor, is\nequal to that of any other.\nTo my mind, the ultimate form of multilateralism\nis a United Nations with a General Assembly already\nrevitalized, a Security Council that is truly\nrepresentative of the United Nations membership, and a\nstreamlined Secretariat that is responsive to the needs\nand interests of all Member States.\nNowhere is the necessity for multilateralism more\nglaring than in our response to the scourge of our time:\ninternational terrorism. And nowhere else is the role of\nthe United Nations more vital.\nThe 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in this\ncity and in Washington were not only an attack against\nthe United States but also an attack against civilization\nand all human values. Therefore, the coalition that\nresponded to these attacks had to represent all of\nhumanity \u2014 all nations, religions and cultures.\nFor those reasons the United Nations was actively\ninvolved in the response to the attacks and must\nmaintain a pivotal role in the response of the world\ncommunity to the persistent threat of international\nterrorism; otherwise, in the long run, that endeavour\nwill fail.\nThe same is true of our efforts to advance the\ndisarmament agenda, which is also imperative. Until\nthe States concerned rid themselves of their arsenals of\nmass destruction \u2014 whether nuclear, biological or\nchemical \u2014 the danger remains that much, if not all of\nthe human race, could be wiped out in a single\nholocaust.\nIn accordance with the multilateral principle of\nequality, States should no longer cling to the privileges\nderived from military superiority over others.\nMultilateral affirmative action can also bring\nabout peace, where for many years there has only been\nviolence and bloodshed. In the Middle East, the Powers\nthat wield great influence on the region are called upon\nto adopt a just and balanced approach to the issue of\nPalestine. They can, if they wish, persuade Israel to\nwithdraw its forces from the occupied territories and to\ncease settlement activities in accordance with the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions.\nThat will help pave the way for the realization of\ntwo States, Palestine and Israel, living side by side\nwithin secure internationally recognized borders. Only\nthen will peace have a real chance.\nIn this context we note with interest the\ncommuniqu\u00e9 issued yesterday by the Quartet on the\nMiddle East outlining a roadmap to realize such a\nvision.\nElsewhere, it is important to recall that the\nsituation in Iraq has been an issue that has occupied the\nSecurity Council for some time. Hence, while over the\npast weeks we have witnessed an intensification of the\ninternational focus on this issue, we must not lose sight\nof the fact that mechanisms already exist within the\nUnited Nations system to address the issue. In tackling\nthe present challenge, Indonesia deems it necessary\nthat peaceful efforts be fully exhausted and existing\nUnited Nations mechanisms be fully utilized, and, if\nneed be, strengthened.\nAny unilateral use of force risks not only\nundermining the authority of the United Nations, but\nwould also carry the grave potential of destabilizing the\nimmediate region, and indeed beyond, with its\nattendant humanitarian implications.\nFor its part, Iraq must fully comply with the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. We are\nencouraged by the recent decision by the Government\nof Iraq to allow the return of United Nations inspectors.\nWe trust that this will pave the way to a peaceful\nsolution of the problem and preclude any attack against\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq.\nThe situation in Iraq cannot be viewed in\nisolation. How we address this problem will have\nrepercussions on the longer-standing issue of Palestine\nand the challenge of terrorism.\nIn Afghanistan, the United Nations has done\ncommendable work in helping the Afghan parties\nmanage the post-Taliban transition. The international\ncommunity must now help the Afghan people in\nnation-building, rehabilitating the country's\ninfrastructure and strengthening its newborn\nGovernment.\nIn the long run, the war against terrorism can only\nbe won if we emerge victorious in a more basic\nstruggle \u2014 the one against poverty. The substantial\neradication of poverty, in fact, is what the development\ngoals of the Millennium Declaration all boil down to.\nAs reported by the Secretary-General, the world\n8\n\ncommunity has made some progress in this endeavour,\nwith East Asia recording the most significant gains.\nWe still have a long way to go, however, before\nwe can meet the goal of reducing by one half, between\n1990 and 2015, the number of people living on less\nthan a dollar a day.\nIf the Millennium goals will be met at all, a major\nfactor will be the achievement of an international trade\nregime where unilateral practices and protectionism\nhave given way to genuine multilateralism. Hence, we\ntrust that the forthcoming negotiations mandated by the\nFourth World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial\nConference at Doha last year will make possible the\nfull integration of developing countries into the\nmultilateral trading system. Much also depends on\nwhether the pledges made in Monterrey at the\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment could be fulfilled and then exceeded.\nEarlier this month, the World Summit on\nSustainable Development reached agreement on a\nglobal programme to reduce poverty and restore the\nintegrity of our planet and formulated a blueprint for\nswitching to a more efficient use of carbon fuels and\nrenewable sources of energy. Despite the lack of a\ntimetable, the fact remains that we have an action-\noriented plan of implementation to be carried out by a\nglobal partnership of governments, private business\nand civil society.\nA factor that can work against our hopes is a\nunilateralist trend so apparent at the global level. In the\nface of that trend, it becomes even more necessary and\ndesirable that regional organizations grow in strength\nand share some of the burden that is now borne by the\nUnited Nations. This role was envisioned for them\neven when the world organization was still being\nestablished more than fifty-seven years ago.\nIn general, regional organizations strictly adhere\nto a multilateral regime, and at that level many global\nproblems are so much more manageable. It may\ntherefore be highly advisable to find ways and means\nof further promoting the natural synergy between the\nUnited Nations and regional organizations. A good\nexample is the Association of Southeast Asian Nations\n(ASEAN), of which Indonesia is a founding member.\nFor many years now, we in ASEAN have been working\nwith United Nations bodies to the considerable benefit\nof our peoples. It is in this spirit that we, the ASEAN\ncountries, are sponsoring a resolution in the General\nAssembly on strengthening the working relationship\nbetween our regional organization and the United\nNations system.\nLong before the 11 September attacks, a regional\nprogramme to combat terrorism and other transnational\ncrimes was an integral part of our ASEAN functional\ncooperation. In the face of the surge of this global\nthreat, ASEAN has set in motion a work plan to\nimplement the 2001 ASEAN Declaration on Terrorism\nand Transnational Crime.\n We believe, however, that it is the totality of\nASEAN's work that will decisively overcome not only\nterrorism but also the basic problem of poverty in our\nregion. Since it was founded in 1967, ASEAN has\ntirelessly promoted political, economic and social\ndevelopment cooperation among its members. The\nresult has been three decades of relative peace and\nunprecedented economic growth, interrupted only by\nthe Asian financial crisis of 1997. To forestall the\nrecurrence of such a devastating crisis, we have taken\nbold steps toward regional integration. Through this\napproach, we hope to achieve our vision of an ASEAN\nthat is at peace within itself and with others, an\nASEAN that is technologically competitive with the\nrest of the world and, through sustainable development,\nhas reached, for our part of the world, the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals.\nFrom the time of its inception, ASEAN has been\nmuch criticized for its preoccupation with consultations\nand consensus-building, which seem to delay action\nwhen swift action is needed. I am not troubled by this\ncriticism because I regard it as an affirmation of\nASEAN's adherence to the multilateral ethos.\nMultilateralism gives ASEAN coherence, commitment\nand perseverance in the pursuit of its goals. That is\nwhy it has been an effective catalyst for the promotion\nof security and economic cooperation in the Asia-\nPacific region.\nAt the national level, Indonesia has been similarly\ndoubted: it is said that reform legislation has been\nlagging because of dithering and interminable debate.\nMoreover, in some international circles, Indonesia has\nbeen portrayed as less than fully enthusiastic in the\nglobal fight against terror on the basis of a mistaken\nperception that it is lenient with radical Muslim groups.\nAnd yet, after all the necessary debates, we did\ntake large strides toward further democratization. Our\nparliament recently endorsed several amendments to\n9\n\nour Constitution: the adoption of a system of direct\npopular election of the President and Vice-President,\nthe adoption of a bicameral system of legislature, and\nthe abolition by 2004 of the 38 seats reserved for the\nmilitary and police in the legislature.\nA proposal for the adoption of the Shariah or\nMuslim law in our legal system did not obtain support.\nThe proponents graciously and democratically accepted\nthis reality and bowed to the decision of the people's\nrepresentatives and to the force of public opinion. This\nreflects our common commitment to democracy.\nWe will adhere to the democratic process even in\naddressing serious threats to our national security, such\nas the separatist movements in the provinces of Aceh\nand Papua and the disruptive communal strife in the\nprovinces of Maluku. On Aceh, we are prepared to\nresume negotiations with the Free Aceh Movement,\nprovided the Movement drop its separatist demand,\ncease resorting to terrorist tactics and accept the law on\nspecial autonomy as a final political solution to the\nproblem. At the same time, we shall continue to\nprovide protection to civilians from terrorist attacks\nthat disrupt public order and cause much suffering.\nWe have also applied special autonomy to the\nprovince of Papua, which guarantees protection of the\ncultural rights of the people, a just and equitable share\nof the resources for development, and redress of\nlegitimate grievances. In the provinces of Maluku and\nNorth Maluku, communal strife has greatly abated with\nthe signing of two peace agreements between the\nfactions and the holding of reconciliation dialogues.\nThe main task now is to build goodwill among the\ncommunities and help thousands of internally displaced\npersons return home and start a new life.\nIn many of our endeavours at political, economic\nand social reform, we have been supported by United\nNations organizations, funds and programmes. We are\ntherefore deeply grateful to the Secretary-General for\nhis intention to enhance United Nations efforts to assist\nIndonesia in promoting good governance and in\nestablishing a stable, democratic and prosperous\nsociety.\nThus at the national level, we have committed\nourselves to the processes of dialogue, wide\nparticipation and accountability, which are all inherent\nin a democracy, just as we stand for multilateralism in\ninternational affairs. We are committed to promote and\nprotect the individual rights of our citizens, just as we\nhave always advocated that every nation, no matter\nhow small or powerless, must have a voice in\ninternational affairs.\nAt the same time, however, we affirm that\ndemocracy is not merely the breaking of chains and the\nenjoyment of rights. Whoever would truly be free must\nbind himself to the duties and obligations that match\nand give meaning to his rights. Every individual has\nresponsibilities to the community that nurtures him,\njust as every nation has responsibilities to the\ncommunity of humankind, including the responsibility\nto respect the views of all other members of that\ncommunity. This is the fundamental meaning of\nmultilateralism.\nIn the ultimate analysis, this is all we need to\naddress the challenges of our time and make a more\npeaceful, more just and more prosperous world: that we\nall be sincerely responsible to one another, for one\nanother and for the planet that is our only home in this\nlife.\n\n\n\n\n"

We also wish to convey to the outgoing\nPresident and Bureau the appreciation of Equatorial\nGuinea for their excellent work at a crucial time in the\nhistory of the United Nations.\nThe delegation, the people and the Government of\nEquatorial Guinea welcome the admission of the Swiss\nConfederation to full membership in the United\nNations. Switzerland is a country with which\nEquatorial Guinea has excellent relations of friendship\nand cooperation. This was indeed a historic event that\nstrengthened and reaffirmed the principle of the\nuniversality of the United Nations. We also welcome\nthe forthcoming admission of Timor-Leste to the\nUnited Nations.\nI wish strongly to join Equatorial Guinea's voice\nto the expressions of support and solidarity that have\nbeen heard from this rostrum towards the people and\nthe Government of the United States of America one\nyear after the horror and the barbarity caused by the\nshameful terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001.\nWe reaffirm once again Equatorial Guinea's firm\ncommitment to the ceaseless fight against international\nterrorism and organized crime in all its forms and\nmanifestations, because this is a fight that involves all\nthe nations of the world, united by the ideal of\nmaintaining peace, and because terrorism represents a\nserious challenge to humanity as a whole.\nIndeed, terrorism has become a sophisticated\nnetwork of political, economic and technical plotting\nthat transcends national borders. These are real\norganizations that have the resources to carry out\ncriminal activity.\nEven more disturbing are manifestations of covert\nterrorism carried out under the pretext of defending and\nprotecting democracy and human rights. This leads us\nto declare that one cannot combat terrorism in certain\nareas and encourage it in others, depending on who the\npotential victims may be. Equatorial Guinea and other\ncountries in our subregion continue to be victims of\nthis ambiguity and contradiction. The demands made\non our countries and the conditionalities imposed on us\nin the name of promoting democracy and human rights\nmust not serve as a pretext for encouraging intolerance\nor political extremism or for instigating confrontation\namong the various social groupings in a country so as\nto weaken its sense of unity and solidarity.\n15\n\nTime and again we have stressed the imperative\nneed to preserve peace and security in the world. The\ninternational community has to reactivate its machinery\nfor conflict prevention and settlement, because these\nconflicts are a scourge on vast areas of the world in\ngeneral, and to the African continent in particular.\nBecause of its geography, Equatorial Guinea is\nseriously concerned about constant serious threats to\nthe maintenance of peace and stability in Central\nAfrica resulting from disputes and greed for the\nenormous natural resources located there. Because of\nthe geo-strategic importance of the subregion, we want\nto preserve a balance of force in the Gulf of Guinea,\nand we want to preserve our area as a haven of peace,\nstability and prosperity for our peoples.\nThe United Nations must be vigilant, given the\nthreats to peace, security and stability in the Gulf of\nGuinea. In the specific case of Equatorial Guinea, I\nwould like to say that for over 25 years it was under\nUnited Nations supervision, vis-\u2021-vis human rights, but\nthat on 19 April 2002 at the fifty-eighth session of the\nUnited Nations Commission on Human Rights\nresolution 2002/11 was adopted. The resolution ended\nthe Special Rapporteur's mission for human rights in\nEquatorial Guinea. The Commission on Human Rights\ntherein explicitly recognized the efforts made by our\nGovernment and the progress made by our country in\nthe area of human rights and strengthening democracy.\nHowever, we were deeply distressed a few days\nlater to see that our country was a victim of attempted\nterrorist action against the life of individuals and social\npeace. Those responsible were arrested and will now be\ntried under our law. Yet, some pressure groups with\nundeclared interests in Equatorial Guinea have spoken\nout and have been trying to use the forthcoming trial as\na basis for launching a new campaign of defamation\nagainst my country in the face of these acts of\ndestabilization. In addition, these groups are still\nseeking to confuse the issue and to keep the\ninternational community uninformed as to the true\npolitical, economic and social developments in\nEquatorial Guinea. These groups have been trying to\ndisrupt a good climate of dialogue and understanding\nbetween our Government and the political forces in our\ncountry. However, as concerns these manoeuvres, I\nwould reaffirm to the international community our\nresolve to preserve the spirit of trying to reach\nconsensus with all the political groupings in our\ncountry to ensure that the forthcoming presidential\nelections proceed smoothly.\nThe situation we have just described is not\npeculiar to Equatorial Guinea, because the same\nsituation can be seen in several countries in our\nsubregion. My country is resolved to ensure that\nCentral Africa becomes an area of peace, solidarity and\ncooperation.\nWe hail the initiatives under way to restore peace\nto Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and\nBurundi, and we commend the work of the United\nNations to that end.\nThe picture of conflict and instability in the world\ntoday stands in stark contrast to our desire to encourage\neconomic development and prosperity for all countries\nof the world. Just a few days ago in Johannesburg, at\nthe World Summit on Sustainable Development, the\ninternational community undertook to work in\nsolidarity to achieve the goals set at Rio de Janeiro, the\nMillennium Summit and Monterrey. To that end, it is\nessential that a new civilization and a new political\nculture bud and take root in the consciousness of the\ninternational community, recognizing once and for all\nthat all nations of the world, rich and poor, large and\nsmall, enjoy the same rights to peace, stability and\nprosperity. This is essential if we are to survive the\ncurrent crisis.\nThis General Assembly faces the challenge of\nresolving burning issues, such as combating HIV/AIDS\nand implementing the goals of the Millennium\nDeclaration and the Johannesburg Consensus.\nMy Government shares these concerns and urges\nthat top priority be given to strengthening the\ndemocratic process and the rule of law, protecting\nhuman rights, ensuring good governance and achieving\nsustainable development. We also believe that the\npeace process in the Middle East should be\nencouraged, along with the dialogue under way\nbetween North and South Korea, with a view to\npeaceful reunification.\nWe also encourage democratization in the United\nNations itself, so that it can strengthen its efforts in the\nworld as the principal guarantor of international peace\nand security. This General Assembly session, just like\nthe meetings at Johannesburg and other summits,\nprovides an excellent opportunity, not for reviving an\nanachronistic confrontation between nations, but rather\n16\n\nfor moving deeper into the area of reaching agreement\nand of holding a dialogue in the great debate for the\nprogress and prosperity of all peoples in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives me great pleasure to congratulate\nMr. Jan Kavan on his election to the presidency of the\nGeneral Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. I am\nconfident that the many posts he has occupied will\nfacilitate his task in leading the deliberations of the\nGeneral Assembly to their desired objectives. I also\nexpress our appreciation to his predecessor for the\nefforts he made to bring the deliberations of the fifty-\nsixth session to a successful conclusion.\nI would be remiss if I failed to express our\nappreciation to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his\nefforts to preserve the principles and purposes of the\n12\n\nUnited Nations Charter. I wish him success as he\nstrives to contribute successfully to the just solution of\nthe problems that the international community faces.\nI would also like wholeheartedly to welcome\nSwitzerland as the long-awaited newest Member of the\nOrganization. We look forward to cooperating with it\nin promoting the principles of the United Nations and\nsafeguarding its Charter.\nThis session of the General Assembly has been\nconvened one year after the 11 September attacks,\nwhich had an impact on the current international\nsituation. In the aftermath of the attacks, many grave\nissues remained unresolved, awaiting effective\nsolutions, and many questions went unanswered. The\nstate of confusion, incertitude and tension on the\ninternational scene results from the feeling of the\nmajority of the world's people that they have lost their\norientation. This results from a tendency on the part of\nsome to use practices that can be best characterized as\nunilateral, expressing an appetite for hegemony and\nmonopoly over the wealth of others.\nThe Middle East region is a case in point. After\ndecades of struggle waged by the people of the region\nto liberate themselves from colonialism and foreign\ndomination and to try to eliminate injustices resulting\nfrom the redrawing of maps and the enforcement of\nartificial borders between them, the people of the\nregion are facing a more vicious attack today than they\nfaced during earlier colonial periods.\nThe Arab countries have condemned the attacks\nagainst the United States of America. They have\nexpressed sympathy for the families of the victims.\nNonetheless, a year after the event that was officially\nlinked to the Al Qaeda organization and the Taliban\nmovement, the world wonders how those accusations\nwere re-channelled so as to be levelled against the\nArab countries to such a degree that some of them are\nbeing threatened, while none of them had anything to\ndo with the attacks.\nThe irony is starker since justification for the\naccusation is usually linked to the presence of some Al\nQaeda elements in those countries or to the fact that\nsuch elements are nationals of those countries, while it\nis public knowledge that elements of the Al Qaeda\norganization are present in more than 60 countries\naround the world, including the United States of\nAmerica, according to official American statements.\nSince the end of the Second World War, our\nregion has witnessed a series of wars and destruction as\na result of an Israeli approach based on occupation,\nsettlement building and the uprooting of hundreds of\nthousands of Palestinians from their homeland. The\nUnited Nations has made efforts to find a just solution\nfor the Arab-Israeli conflict. To that end, the United\nNations has adopted hundreds of resolutions that Israel\nhas refused to implement, in a stark challenge to the\nwill of the international community. Israel continues to\noccupy the Golan, the West Bank and Gaza and parts of\nLebanese territory.\nWhen the Arab countries unanimously launched\ntheir peace initiative at the Beirut summit in March\n2002, Israel responded by launching a widescale\nmilitary attack against Palestinian cities, villages and\ncamps in the West Bank. Israel's defiance of\ninternational legitimacy assumed proportions that have\nbeen condemned by international public opinion,\nparticularly when the Israeli Government refused to\nreceive the fact-finding mission to investigate the\ndetails of the massacre at the Jenin refugee camp.\nIsrael has claimed that the crimes it has carried\nagainst the Palestinian people under occupation have\nbeen carried out in self-defence and in the war against\nterrorism. We see how Israel has manipulated the war\nagainst the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. In\nthat context, it is important to stress that silence in the\nface of such manipulation amounts to total disregard\nfor human values, as much as it is disregard for\ndefenceless Palestinian souls.\nWithout going into details of the Israeli attacks\nand violations in which American weapons were used,\nthe only way out of the crisis faced by the peoples of\nthe region is by making Israel abide by relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions, which thus far are 28 in\nnumber. Is it reasonable for the world to request Iraq to\nimplement Security Council resolutions, while some\nhelp Israel remain above international law? It is indeed\nlegitimate for us to ask the United States to distance\nitself from the aggressive Israeli practices and to apply\nto Israel the American law that prohibits the use of\nAmerican weapons against a third party. It is indeed\nodd that the United States considers Israel to be acting\nin self-defence in occupied territories, which is not in\nkeeping with Security Council resolutions in whose\ndrafting and adoption the United States itself has\nparticipated since the founding of the United Nations.\n13\n\nJust and comprehensive peace in our region can\nbe achieved only through the implementation of\nresolutions of international legitimacy that stress the\nneed for Israel to withdraw from all the Arab territories\noccupied since June 1967 and to safeguard the\nlegitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including\nthe right to establish their independent State with\nJerusalem as its capital.\nMuch has been said recently about the danger of\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and\nthe possibility that international terrorists might\nacquire such weapons. As is well known, that danger is\nnot limited to one region. Rather, it exists in many\nregions of the world. It is regrettable that certain\nparties focus only on some Arab and Muslim countries,\nand not on others, ignoring in the meantime Israel's\nnuclear arsenal. All the countries of the region have\nexpressed, year after year, their readiness to make the\nMiddle East region a zone free of all weapons of mass\ndestruction \u2014 nuclear, chemical and biological.\nToday more than ever before, we call for urgent\nand serious efforts to make our region free of all\nweapons of mass destruction, under the supervision of\nthe United Nations. We declare from this rostrum that\nall the Arab countries are prepared to establish such a\nzone, provided that Israel will agree to establish such a\nzone and to submit all its nuclear facilities to the\nsafeguards system of the International Atomic Energy\nAgency (IAEA), as have the other Middle East, Arab\nand Muslim countries of the region.\nThe majority vote that Syria won upon submitting\nits candidacy for membership to the Security Council\nhighlights the appreciation of these countries for\nSyria's constructive role in supporting the United\nNations.\n\nIt is well known that Syria has always been in the\nforefront of countries whose respect for international\nlegitimacy constitutes a principled position in their\nforeign policy. We agree with the Secretary-General\nabout the necessity of avoiding unilateral measures and\nresorting instead to working within the framework of\nthe United Nations, which represents international\nlegitimacy.\nIn that light, we see no justification for igniting a\nnew war in the Middle East. We strongly believe that\nstriking Iraq, which no longer occupies the land of\nothers, while keeping silent about the Israeli\noccupation of the Arab territories occupied since 1967,\nrepresents blind bias and a distorted vision of the real\nsituation in the Middle East.\nThe international community is committed to the\nunity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq. We\ncannot recall anyone doubting that commitment. We\nalso stress that it is the right of the Iraqi people alone\nto decide their future without any interference in their\ninternal affairs. It is the duty of all Members of our\nOrganization to commit themselves to the\nimplementation of United Nations resolutions. In\nkeeping with that commitment, Syria supports the\nresumption of dialogue between Iraq and the Secretary-\nGeneral with the objective of reaching a political\nsolution that meets the requirements of the Security\nCouncil and that grants Iraq hope of peace, security\nand the lifting of the sanctions imposed on it,\nespecially as Iraq has officially recognized the State of\nKuwait and its international borders.\nSyria has expressed its satisfaction at positive\ndevelopments in the African continent. We are\nconfident that the establishment of the African Union\nwill have a positive impact on the present and future of\nthat continent and on solving the urgent problems it\nfaces. In that regard, we look forward with true hope to\nthe implementation of agreements recently signed by\nthe parties concerned to end the fighting in Angola,\nCongo and the Great Lakes region.\nSyria also expresses its satisfaction at the\nincreasing international support to end the embargo\nagainst Cuba.\nSyria further welcomes the high-level talks\nbetween the Democratic People's Republic of Korea\nand the Republic of Korea and expresses the hope that\nthis rapprochement between the two Koreas will help\nachieve the aspirations of the people of the Korean\npeninsula by peaceful means.\nThe Syrian Arab Republic hopes that peace and\nstability will prevail in Afghanistan in the interest of\nthe Afghan people, who have long suffered the\nscourges of war and internal strife.\nSyria supports the efforts of the Government of\nthe Sudan to preserve the unity and territorial integrity\nof the Sudanese people and calls for a ceasefire in the\n14\n\nsouth of Sudan as a prelude to the resumption of\ndialogue.\nSyria supports the Artah agreement reached by\nthe Somalis and deems it the most viable solution for\nachieving national reconciliation in Somalia.\nThe world's peoples are passing through a\ndifficult test at this critical juncture; the choices of\neven big and influential countries, are getting narrower\nrather than broader due to the absence of a just world\norder. It is to be regretted that the voices of those who\ncall for war rise above the voices of those who call for\npeace and that those who usurp the rights of people and\nencroach on their dignity are drowning out the voices\nof those who defend the rights of people regarding\ntheir territory and freedom.\nBut despite this grim picture, right will, in the\nfinal analysis, triumph over injustice. That is the\ncorrect reading of the history of nations and\ncivilizations; there is no going back. Arab Syria's\nbelief in its rights and the rights of other nations cannot\nbe shaken or undermined by hegemony and the\narrogance of power. We are convinced of the\npossibility of building a world in which all coexist in\npeace and security, a world free of occupation and\nhegemony, a world in which all peoples equally share\nthe resources of our globe and the fruits of science and\ntechnology in order to achieve prosperity for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would\nlike to congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan on his deserved\nelection as President of the General Assembly at this\nsession. We wish him every success. I would also like\nto pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, whose efforts to promote peace and\ncooperation among nations are invaluable. Yesterday,\nin this city, we remembered the victims of a horrendous\nattack that was the very image of intolerance and\nfanaticism and revealed the darkest drives of human\nnature. I was deeply moved by this event and feel duty\nbound on behalf of my compatriots to express our pain,\nsorrow, and solidarity with those lost loved ones, and\nto all the citizens of the United States at this time of\naffliction.\nThis terrible episode in history ought, however, to\nprompt us to rethink a number of dogmas concerning\nthe current world paradigm for development, dogmas\nthat prevent it from being sustainable over time, and\nwhich, like a dangerous mirage, may lead the whole of\nhumankind into a collapse that could jeopardize our\ncommon future.\nI say this from the standpoint of a country, which,\nin its small way, is joining the collective endeavour to\nsolve key problems that involve the fate of the whole\nplanet. I am also convinced that it is in the poor\ncountries of the world that the destiny of all is at stake.\nWhat we do, but above all what is done by those who\npossess more, and have put into effect a specific vision\nof society and of the economy that prevails today, shall\ndetermine whether our path will be one of hope or of\ncatastrophe for all.\nOn 9 April 1952  50 years ago  Bolivia took\nthe lead in a revolution that sought to democratize\npolitics and end economic, social and ethnic exclusion,\nin order to attain a fairer national community. For the\npast 20 years we have kept that democracy functioning\nand we have been a pioneer nation in regulating our\neconomy. Today, this process based on stability and\ndialogue is continuing.\nHowever, all that has been done is still\ninsufficient. The road that lies ahead is very long, and\nwe must travel it amidst crises and turmoil from which\nwe have been unable to extricate ourselves. The social\nand economic problems we face are serious. Much of\nwhat we have achieved could be destroyed by pressure\nexerted by those, who in spite of everything, have been\nmarginalized and excluded. This situation is rooted in\noverwhelming poverty, the unfair distribution of\nwealth, and the loss of faith in politicians, associated\nwith corruption and the lack of answers to pressing\ndaily problems.\nOur team became the Government of Bolivia as a\nresult of a popular vote only thirty-six days ago, and\nwe are committed to tackling these risks and challenges\nwith resolution. We are doing this within the\nframework of a new democratic landscape. The\nelection of 30 June 2002 established a new parliament\nthat is diverse; this took place without violence or\ndramatic disruption and within a context of democratic\nand political maturity. Its main effect has been to begin\nto dismantle the walls of exclusion, on the basis of the\nrecognition of others and tolerance and respect for\ndifferent visions of the world.\nFor the first time in our history, an essential part\nof Bolivia's population, the Quechuas, Aymaras and\nGuaranis, are represented in fair proportion. A\npluralistic legislative branch in ethnic, economic,\npolitical and social respects is a promising setting for\ncourageous dialogue about our ongoing problems. Our\nunswerving resolve is that this dialogue should be real\nand productive, because it will help us to find a way of\nworking together on the political and social levels,\nwhile seeking to resolve these crises and working\nsincerely to break the long-standing social exclusion of\nindigenous people and discrimination against women,\nchildren, and older persons.\nI would like particularly to mention the resolve of\nour Government to make combating corruption a state\npolicy. Only genuine and resolute efforts in this area\n24\n\nwill make it possible for Bolivia to overcome one of\nthe greatest impediments to development, one that\nthreatens to destroy the essential foundation of our\nsociety. This resolve is part of a historic course\nfollowed, despite their different positions, by two\nparties in Bolivia: the Nationalist Revolutionary\nMovement and the Revolutionary Left Movement.\nTheir leaders, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and Jaime\nPaz Zamora, have understood that, at such a time, it is\nnecessary to set aside legitimate party interests and\nlong-standing political differences in order to build a\nproject of responsibility vis-\u2021-vis Bolivia. This is the\nonly response possible for our nation at such a historic\nmoment. This decision led to an alliance that has given\nrise to Plan Bolivia aimed at tackling the crisis by\nmeans of an ambitious programme of public investment\nthat will stimulate the economy, encourage private\ninputs, create jobs, and reduce social inequities by\nfavouring the most vulnerable sectors of our society.\nPlan Bolivia also seeks to respond to the complex\nchallenges of globalization, redefine the role of the\nState in promoting sustainable development, respond to\nlocal and regional demands, and establish a full rule of\nlaw with robust and credible institutions.\nWe know that we are not alone in this; we have\nseen such ideas elsewhere in recent decades. In spite of\nthis, we urgently require our efforts to be backed by the\ninternational community. Bolivia has undertaken with\ndetermination the struggle to combat illicit drug\ntrafficking as a moral imperative, in which we truly\nbelieve; but, in doing so, it has paid a high price in\nterms of human lives, economic effects, and violent\nsocial conflict. It is only right that those countries\nwhere drug consumption has greatest impact \ndemand as you know is the key factor in this cycle \ngive us support in proportion. We continue to fulfil our\ncommitments. But we urgently call on the international\ncommunity to fully endorse the concept of shared\nresponsibility, which has been fostered and promoted\nin this forum more than once.\nA combination of internal efforts and\ninternational support to attain reasonable levels of\nsustainable social and economic development must be\nreached through a new logic that reformulates all of\nour earlier ideas of progress and development.\nOur afflicted Latin America was yesterday the\nhope of the planet and today is a continent caught in an\nemergency situation, with widespread social pressure,\nand economic collapse and facing a dangerous threat of\nan international domino effect. From its modest\nposition, our country wishes to help halt these trends\nby being an example of how creative and democratic\nsolutions can be used to address problems and\novercome differences. This prompts us to emphasize\nthat the most effective international aid is that which\nrespects the decisions and plans of the countries that\nmust use them. Imposing strict and unilateral recipes\nusually generates more problems than it solves.\nIf equity is one of the first demands of\nhumankind today, there is no better system than that of\nequitable international trade. Poor countries demand\naccess for their products to the markets of the rich\ncountries under adequate conditions. This is one of the\nkey points of nexus of poverty and social tensions in\nthe most disadvantaged countries and their population.\nThat is why the Andean Trade Preference Act\nconstitutes a step forward; although only conditional, it\nshows the will of a friendly nation to modify a still\nunfair relationship.\nWe must understand free trade from a new\nstandpoint, where the rules of the game are designed\nrationally to bridge the gap between the rich and the\npoor, a situation that has already reached scandalous\nlevels. It is unacceptable for prosperous nations to\nimpose limits on us, while they are not prepared to\napply them within their own territories.\nI cannot conclude this intervention without\nreaffirming that recovering our status as a country with\na coastline on the Pacific Ocean constitutes an\nimportant factor of our foreign policy.\nThis claim, which we have made for the past 123\nyears, is not the product of stubbornness or whim; it is\nrelated to our insufficient economic resources and to\nthe enormous geographical barriers that affect our\ncompetitiveness. The lack of direct access to the sea\nconstitutes an obstacle to our growth and to the welfare\nof our citizens. The recovery of sovereign access to the\nsea is not only a matter of justice, but an ineluctable\nneed for which we shall continue to seek the solidarity\nand support of the community of nations, and even\nmore so now that century-old conflicts of this nature\nhave been resolved in this new century.\nBolivia is part of the world and, through vigorous\nparticipation within its region, will continue to\ncontribute to a profound process of reflection regarding\nthe type of global society that we must, wish to and can\n25\n\nbuild, based on its experiences and its own formulas\nfor integrating and for making its own society\nparticipative.\nWe are probably experiencing one of the most\ndifficult moments since the end of the cold war and it\nhas become necessary for us to be able to imagine a\ndifferent and better world in which no idea is\nuntouchable and no hope for change is smothered.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the\nEuropean Union, I am honoured to address the General\nAssembly at its fifty-seventh session.\nA year ago today, the world woke up to a terrible\nnew reality; but it was also a wake-up call for us to join\nforces and present a solid front against the perpetrators\nof terror, the enemies of freedom. Not so far from here,\nat the heart of New York's pulsating business\ncommunity, the twin towers used to stand, representing\nthe pride of all New Yorkers in their city. But now, they\nhave been replaced by a gaping hole, a memento of that\nfateful September day when terror reared its ugly head\nand, for a while, the very pulse of this city seemed to\nstop. For on that day, terror came to America, leaving\nin its wake death and destruction and thousands upon\nthousands of sorrowing mourners.\nIt was the moment which marked the division of\nour world into civilized nations and those that use\nterror as their weapon; but it was also the day which\nsaw us take a stand against evil. It was the day when\nwe decided to stand shoulder to shoulder in a\nworldwide coalition against these men of terror and\ntheir cowardly acts.\nAnd, when the call for action came, it was here,\nwithin these walls at the United Nations, that we met to\ngive each other renewed hope and confidence. It was as\nnatural as it was necessary, because the attack was\ndirected against the very foundation of this\nOrganization, planned by cowards in their lairs\nconspiring against world peace and security, launched\nby fanatics violating every basic law of humanity, and\nsupported by tyranny oppressing liberty and equality.\nFor make no mistake, these acts of terrorism have not\nweakened us; they have only served to strengthen our\nresolve to actively seek security and prosperity for all\nconsistent with the United Nations Charter and\ninternational law. And, from the outset, the United\nNations has played a crucial role in the fight against\nterrorism.\nOn our part in the European Union, there could\nbe no hesitation. Our way was and is clear. We fully\nsupport the initiatives of the United Nations Counter-\nTerrorism Committee because we will never allow\n28\n\nterror and fear to obscure freedom and democracy. The\nEuropean Union therefore intends actively to assist\nother nations in implementing Security Council\nresolution 1373 (2001). The European Union remains\ncommitted to finalizing and adopting the\ncomprehensive convention against terrorism and we\ntherefore strongly urge all Member States to join and\nimplement the 12 United Nations conventions on\nterrorism.\nThe key role played by the United Nations in the\nfight against terrorism is a reminder of the fact that the\nUnited Nations itself was born out of hope founded on\nthe ashes of the Second World War \u2014 a war which\ndefeated tyranny and terror. With the adoption of the\nMillennium Declaration, the United Nations has been\ngiven renewed impetus to deal globally with conflict\nprevention, crisis management, humanitarian\nassistance, post-conflict rehabilitation and\ndevelopment, and disarmament and arms control. In the\ncomplicated area of peacemaking, the United Nations\nand the European Union work tirelessly to find\nsolutions in the Middle East through the efforts of the\nQuartet and in finding a permanent settlement on\nCyprus consistent with the relevant Security Council\nresolutions. The European Union is a major partner in\nthe rebuilding of a new Afghanistan freed from terror.\nIn the Middle East, Iraq remains a major source\nof concern with regard to weapons of mass destruction,\nas President Bush emphasised in his important\nstatement this morning. Iraq must grant unconditional\nand unimpeded access for the weapons inspectors to\nIraq and the required cooperation from its authorities to\nthe inspectors. Iraq is in breach of several resolutions\nof the Security Council on its disarmament obligations.\nThese obligations must be complied with immediately.\nThe European Union is determined to support further\nefforts of the United Nations to that end. We agree with\nthe United States that this matter should urgently be\ndealt with by the Security Council and we agree with\nthe Secretary-General that, if Iraq's defiance continues,\nthe Security Council must face up to its\nresponsibilities.\nThe European Union, conscious of its obligations,\nremains strongly engaged in United Nations-mandated\noperations throughout the world, from holding in check\nthe civil war in Sierra Leone to building a secure,\nprosperous and democratic Kosovo. We also strongly\nsupport the initiatives to strengthen the United Nations\nfuture peacekeeping capacity. We owe it to our armed\nforces to ensure an efficient and robust framework for\nfuture operations.\nBut we must not forget that at the heart of all\nthese conflicts are human beings, who are sometimes\nstruggling to achieve what we take for granted. For\nhuman rights are fundamental to the lives and dignity\nof all human beings. The primary, fundamental and\nessential accomplishment of the United Nations will\none day be the full enjoyment of all human rights by\neveryone everywhere: the right of each individual to\nfeel that life, body and property are hers or his alone\nand to feel safe and secure; the right of each individual\nto face authorities without fear of injustice or\nharassment; and the right of each individual to learn\nthat people can speak up for themselves with\nconfidence and without having to fear the\nconsequences.\nHuman rights are also fundamental to human\nprosperity and development. The European Union\ntherefore strongly supports the efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral to integrate human rights into all United\nNations activities.\nSadly, cruelty toward the defenceless, violence,\nmaltreatment and torture remain widespread. The\nEuropean Union strongly supports the adoption of the\ndraft optional protocol to the United Nations\nConvention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman\nand Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\nThe European Union also advocates universal\nabolition of the death penalty. No State should grant\nitself the right to take life. Where the death penalty still\nexists, we call for its use to be progressively restricted.\nWe would like to see all nations introduce a\nmoratorium on this form of punishment and,\neventually, to end it altogether, so that it will become a\nthing of the past.\nUntil women are in possession of all human\nrights and are able to take charge of their lives and to\nachieve their full potential, sustainable development\nwill remain but a dream. The European Union remains\ncommitted to fighting all forms of discrimination and\nviolence against women, including murder and\nmutilation through a misguided sense of honour. By the\nsame token, we vigorously pursue the global fight\nagainst racism, discrimination and intolerance. These\ndeplorable attitudes and actions are regrettably still\npart of everyday life throughout the world. They do not\nbelong here at the doorstep of the new millennium.\n29\n\nPeople do not need revenge; they want justice.\nThey do not wish for impunity; they want\naccountability. That is what the International Criminal\nCourt (ICC) is about. We now have a permanent\ninternational court that can bring those accused of war\ncrimes and other perpetrators of the most serious\ncrimes of international concern to trial. The European\nUnion supports the ICC as an important historic\nmilestone. It reflects a new level of international\ncooperation. We are confident that the ICC will\ncontribute to strengthening respect for international\nhumanitarian law and human rights. The European\nUnion expresses its strong hope that countries that at\npresent have reservations about the Statute will join as\nsoon as possible. We believe that the Court will prove\nto be an effective, competent and fair legal instrument.\nRidding the world of persistent poverty remains\nthe greatest global challenge of all. We have achieved\nsignificant results in the fight against poverty and\nmisery, but the world community still has far to go if\nwe are to meet the goals of the Millennium\nDeclaration.\nFor many countries, the United Nations is first\nand foremost about combating poverty. How can we\nassure everyone access to the essentials of life? The\nnext meal, medicine and health care to survive and\naccess to basic education: these are the promises\ncontained in the Millennium Declaration, and we must\nnot let the world down.\nAid alone will not eliminate poverty. We know\nthat. Developing countries can take their cue from\nAfrican leaders, who have taken an impressive lead\nwith the New Partnership for Africa's Development\n(NEPAD). This year has seen many decisive steps\ntaken within the fields of trade and development,\nfinance and sustainable development. At Doha,\nMonterrey and Johannesburg, we reached consensus on\nwhat needs to be done. But knowing what has to be\ndone is not enough. As world leaders, we must see that\nit is done.\nThe European Union played a key role in\nreaching this consensus and is therefore committed to\nthis new agenda. We have decided to further open our\nmarkets to exports from the least developed countries.\nWe hope that others will follow the same path.\nTranslating policies on poverty eradication into\nsustainable development requires strong political will\nand true partnership in development. A major challenge\nnow will be to turn the Monterrey Consensus and the\noutcome of Johannesburg into reality. The European\nUnion proposes that the United Nations system monitor\nimplementation of the Johannesburg targets and\nagenda. These and other important United Nations\npolicy issues are spelled out in the European Union\nposition paper.\nOn behalf of the European Union, I am happy to\nwelcome the decisions of Switzerland and East Timor\nto join the United Nations. Two nations \u2014 one old and\none new, one in the North and one in the South: they\nreflect the multitude and the diversity of the United\nNations.\nAt the special session of the General Assembly\non children, young people from all over the world\nillustrated their dream of a world of peace and unity\nusing all the colours of the flags of the Members of the\nUnited Nations.\nBut we should not content ourselves with a\ndream. From the war against international terrorism,\nthrough the quest for justice, to the relentless fight\nagainst poverty, we need a strong and efficient United\nNations. The Declaration on the Rights of the Child\nsays that \u201cmankind owes to the child the best it has to\ngive\u201d (resolution 1386 (XIV), preamble). What better\ngift can we give children than unity among our\nnations?\nLet us seize the moment and take another step\ntowards a true United Nations, united in word and in\ndeed."

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of Prime\nMinister Perry G. Christie, the Government and the\npeople of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, I\ncongratulate you most warmly, Sir, on your election to\nthe presidency of the fifty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly. The Bahamas is confident that this\nsession will be steered to a fruitful conclusion under\nyour able guidance. You and the other members of your\nequally competent Bureau may be assured of the full\nsupport of the Bahamas in the performance of your\nduties. I take this opportunity also to congratulate your\npredecessor from the Republic of Korea for his skilful\nleadership during the fifty-sixth session.\nThe right to self-determination and the full, fair\nand unhindered expression of the will of the people are\nprinciples held in the highest esteem by the Bahamas.\nThe Bahamas looks forward to welcoming the\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste to the United\nNations when it takes its place in the Assembly in just\na few weeks. The Bahamas is also pleased to welcome\nSwitzerland to this family of nations.\nThe world has agreed that the United Nations is a\nplace where nations large and small are equal, where\ndisputes of an international character may be resolved\npeacefully, and where the use of force is supported\nonly in accordance with the United Nations Charter.\nThe Bahamas and all other nations represented here\nhave signed on to this contract, a contract that, in our\nview, is inviolate and must be honoured. This should\nnot be a matter of convenience and, in our view,\napplies to all nations, large and small. Today, I reaffirm\nthe commitment of the Bahamas to the United Nations\nCharter and to the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights. The Government and the people of the\nBahamas believe in the United Nations, and will\ncontinue to support it and to uphold the founding\nprinciples on which its effectiveness and success\ndepends.\nWe reaffirm our commitment to the rule of law,\nand an abiding respect for the right to self-\ndetermination, the sovereignty of nations and the right\nof people everywhere to expect that their Government,\nfreely and democratically elected, will protect their\nrights. We urge world leaders to accept that the freely\nexpressed will of the people is their sole claim to\nlegitimacy and that the will of the people should not be\nsubverted by any means. We reject parochialism as a\njustification for obfuscating the true intent and will of a\npeople as expressed through the ballot box.\nThe Government of the Bahamas believes in good\ngovernance at all levels as a fundamental human right.\nAs an adjunct to that right, we have committed\nourselves to deepening our long-standing democratic\ntradition. General elections are not the end of the story.\nThe citizen must continue to have a role in the\ngovernance of the country. Civil society must be\nactively encouraged to develop and engage in the\naffairs of the country. The Bahamas is committed to\nconsulting its people on all matters of national\nimportance. This becomes critical as our country\nexamines its role and fulfils its obligations to other\nMember States on the bilateral and multilateral levels.\nThe first anniversary of the 11 September attacks\non the World Trade Center in New York and the\nPentagon, near Washington, D.C., and the tragedy in\nPennsylvania, were commemorated just a few days\nago. On that occasion, the Bahamas reiterated its\ncondemnation of those acts as attacks on our values\nand on our civilization. Such acts must not go\nunpunished. We therefore support measures to bring\nthe guilty to justice and to prevent similar attacks in all\ntheir forms and manifestations. We are resolute in our\nviews on this. We pause to remember the families and\nfriends in countries around the world who lost loved\nones in those attacks.\nIn our own country we are seeking to recover\nfrom the knock-on effects of the unemployment the\nattacks caused. We are taking steps to rebuild our\neconomy. We have initiated changes to our domestic\nlaw and we have, in the United Nations, the\nCommonwealth and the Organization of American\nStates, become parties to international conventions to\nbolster our capacity to play our necessary role in the\nfight against these attacks on our way of life. We will\ncontinue to give our full support to international efforts\nto eliminate this scourge. At the same time, we are\n29\n\nkeen to ensure that in this fight the fundamental rights\nand freedoms of our citizens are not eroded.\nThe Bahamas believes that there is no better\nlegacy that we can leave to the generations to come\nthan an Earth that is safe and secure and that can\nsustain life. We firmly believe that there can be\ndevelopment without harm to the environment. We\nemphasized that point at the World Summit on\nSustainable Development. The environment is not only\nthe biological medium that supports the life of the\npeople of the Bahamas, but it is also the central reason\nfor our economic success. The Government has\ntherefore given high priority to preserving and\nprotecting the environment, and has taken practical\nsteps to do so.\nWe reiterate our concern expressed at the Summit\nabout the threat posed to small island developing States\nby all manifestations of climate change, including the\nrise in sea levels. We have repeatedly expressed our\ngrave concern to some of our industrialized partners\nabout the trans-shipment of nuclear waste through the\nCaribbean and about the disastrous effects it might\nhave on the economies of the Bahamas and the\nCaribbean. Tourism is our primary industry. An\naccident involving spent nuclear fuel will almost\ncertainly destroy it. We do not accept that, because the\nrisk of accidents is remote, the transhipment of nuclear\nwaste should be allowed to continue. We make the\nassertion today and ask for the transhipment to cease.\nThe Bahamas joins in urging the early ratification\nand implementation of the Kyoto Protocol and in\nreaffirming its commitment to sustainable development\nand to the Political Declaration and the Plan of\nImplementation of the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment.\nThe international community faces a broad range\nof political, economic, social and cultural issues. We\nhave made inroads, but not sufficient to stem the spiral\nof persistence of poverty, hunger, human rights abuses,\ncrime and diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS, or to\naddress the vulnerability of small island developing\nStates. The Bahamas is particularly concerned about\nHIV/AIDS and the slow progress in fighting the\ndisease.\nThe critical question on HIV/AIDS and all the\nother issues is: Where do we go from here? This body\nhas made important commitments to the world. There\nare reviews, platforms and programmes of action. Our\nrespective publics may be forgiven for their cynicism\nand the criticism levelled that the United Nations is a\ntalking shop. Our view, however, is that it is better to\ntalk than fight. Talking is, in fact, a form of action and\nthere is no doubt that, with regard to HIVAIDS,\ndiscussion of the problem is central to the solutions.\nBut our respective publics are looking for and require\nmore immediate money and direct action. We must not\nbe accused of inaction in the face of human suffering\nand adversity.\nWe in the Bahamas have ably demonstrated our\ndetermination to play our part in these endeavours. We\nhave been credited regionally and internationally for\nour model programmes, particularly in respect to our\ntreatment of and efforts to control the spread of\nHIV/AIDS. We especially wish to thank the World\nHealth Organization and the Pan American Health\nOrganization, now celebrating its hundredth year, for\nthe cooperation they have extended to the Bahamas and\nfor their stellar work in the area of international health.\nWe wish to commend the recent initiative to provide\nantiretroviral drugs to countries of the Caribbean to\nassist in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\nThe Bahamas is concerned about the present\nglobal economic order. We raise questions about\nwhether globalization and trade liberalization can\nindeed function as vehicles for progressive change in\nall countries large and small, developed and\ndeveloping. We are committed to adapting to change,\nbut at a pace and in a manner and form that are\nconsistent with the way we live. The Caribbean\nCommunity (CARICOM), of which the Bahamas is a\npart, has taken up the challenges of ensuring a degree\nof stability among its member countries in the face of\nglobalization. But the Bahamas believes that more can\nand must be done to assist our Caribbean Community\nto adapt to these externally imposed changes through\nequitable and sensitive trade policies and by reform of\nthe international financial institutions and their lending\npractices.\nThe Bahamas is the unwitting transit point for\nillegal activities: the smuggling of human beings and\nthe illicit trade in narcotic drugs. The United States is\nthe ultimate target. We are also suffering from\nincreased violent crime from guns smuggled into our\ncountry from the United States. These guns are\nterrorizing our society. The Bahamas is working\nclosely with the United States and other neighbouring\ncountries to address these issues. There must be a\n30\n\nstronger effective action to reduce demand for drugs in\nthe receiving country. There must be more effective\naction taken to stop the flow of illegal guns.\nThe Bahamas has taken an active interest in the\npeace and stability of its sister CARICOM State, Haiti.\nGiven our longstanding and developing relations with\nHaiti, positive steps taken to provide assistance and\nsupport for Haiti give us great hope. We are especially\npleased with the efforts of the Inter-American\nDevelopment Bank to work with the Government of\nHaiti to remove the existing financial hurdles that\nimpede development efforts. We also welcome the\nrecent Organization of American States (OAS)\nresolution and the announcement by the United States\nthat it would contribute additional resources to the\nOAS special mission in Haiti. Illegal migration from\nHaiti causes a serious drain on the resources of the\nBahamas. In addition to Haitian-Bahamian bilateral\nefforts to address this problem, the Bahamas believes\nthat targeted international initiatives, with the\ncooperation of the Government of Haiti, represent the\nbest hope for the Haitian people.\nIllegal immigration from Cuba also adversely\naffects us. The Bahamas continues to call for the\nnormalization of relations between Cuba and the\nUnited States of America. We believe that such\nnormalization would be central to solving that\ndimension of the migration problem.\nThe Bahamas welcomes the entry into force of\nthe Rome Statute on 1 July 2002 and the establishment\nof the International Criminal Court as a critical tool in\nthe fight against violations of humanitarian\ninternational law and crimes against humanity.\nThe conflict between Israel and the Palestinian\npeople is a matter of concern. There should be peace\nbetween them. We support the peaceful settlement of\nthis issue in accordance with all applicable United\nNations resolutions. Every people deserves to have a\nState to call its own in peace and security.\nThe Bahamas is concerned about developments in\nAfrica. As part of the African diaspora, we wish to see\nAfrica prosper, wars cease and equitable policies\napplied for all of the many and varied people of that\ncontinent.\nWe support the reform of the Security Council.\nThe Bahamas believes that the time has come for us to\ntake the hard decisions and to agree to a practical\nprogramme of reform that takes fully into account the\nneed for equitable membership and for a more\ndemocratic and transparent Council.\nThe Bahamas is a small country whose voice,\nwithout the indispensable forum provided by the\nUnited Nations, would be lost or at best ignored. Here,\nirrespective of size and wealth, we have the ability to\nspeak with equal voice and to vote with equal power on\nmatters that affect the quality of our lives today and\nthat will impact the type of world that we leave in\nplace for future generations. This is why it is vitally\nimportant that we preserve and respect the integrity of\nthis Organization. Member States are bound to come\nhere for redress and should not act unilaterally outside\nthe bounds of the Charter. The Bahamas reaffirms its\ncommitment to the purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations as enshrined in its Charter. I leave the\nAssembly with that commitment here today."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me,\nat the outset, to express my warm congratulations and\nwishes to His Excellency Mr. Jan Kavan for every\nsuccess on his election to the presidency of the fifty-\nseventh session of the General Assembly. I should also\nlike to express my delegation's gratitude to His\nExcellency Mr. Han Seung-soo for the competent and\nable manner in which he conducted the work of the\nfifty-sixth session. I wish to convey to His Excellency\nMr. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, the sincere\nappreciation of His Excellency General Lansana Cont\u00e9,\nPresident of the Republic of Guinea, for his tireless and\ndedicated efforts on behalf of the community of\nnations.\nIn addition, I wish to welcome the admission of\nthe Swiss Confederation, a country of great traditions\nof peace and democracy, to the Organization. My\ndelegation looks forward with great interest to the\nforthcoming entry of the Democratic Republic of\nTimor-Leste to the family of nations. I remain\nconvinced that the accession of those two countries\nwill make a high-quality contribution to the endeavours\nof the international community and will strengthen the\nOrganization's universality.\nTwelve months have passed since the tragic\nevents of 11 September 2001. The global security\nclimate has suffered profound changes, casting new\nlight on the dangers of international terrorism and its\ninterdependence with other forms of crime. Terrorism,\none need hardly stress again, constitutes a menace to\ninternational peace and security. Faced with the global\ndimensions of that scourge, my country associates\nitself fully with the efforts of the international\ncommunity with a view to providing an appropriate\nresponse.\nIn that regard, we hope for the prompt adoption\nof a general convention against terrorism and for the\neffective implementation of other existing international\nlegal instruments. Within the framework of the\ndialogue among civilizations, an appeal should be\naddressed to all countries for the organization of an\nextensive campaign of education and consciousness-\nraising in order to promote tolerance, respect and\nacceptance of others.\nThe current session is being held in a difficult\ninternational context dominated by numerous conflicts\nthat compromise legitimate aspirations to peace and\nprogress. In this climate of violence, nevertheless, a\ngleam of hope can be glimpsed on the African\ncontinent. We welcome the important progress made\ntowards the restoration of peace in Angola and in the\nGreat Lakes region, especially in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo and in Burundi. In the Horn of\nAfrica, peace between Eritrea and Ethiopia is gradually\nreturning, but the Somalia crisis remains more\n17\n\nworrisome than ever. In Western Sahara, my country\nsupports the remarkable work accomplished by the\nPersonal Envoy of the Secretary-General, Mr. James\nBaker. We encourage him to persist in his efforts with a\nview to finding an acceptable and definitive solution to\nthat crisis.\nIn the Middle East, the conflict situation persists.\nThe cycle of acute violence over the past two years has\nwidened further the gap between the parties,\nreinforcing the wall of misunderstanding. The\nGovernment of Guinea is convinced that the\napplication of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)\nand 338 (1973) will allow Palestinians and Israelis to\ncoexist peacefully within secure and internationally\nrecognized borders. We appeal to the two parties to\ncomply unconditionally with Council resolutions 1397\n(2002) and 1402 (2002). We reaffirm the support and\nthe solidarity of Guinea to the brotherly people of\nPalestine, to the Palestinian Authority and to its head,\nPresident Yasser Arafat, who has fought courageously\nfor the creation of an independent and sovereign\nPalestinian State for more than 50 years.\nThe situation in Iraq is a source of vital concern\nto the people and the Government of Guinea. In order\nto prevent further suffering by the Iraqi population and\nto preserve peace in the region as well as international\nsecurity and stability, my country invites the parties to\nshow greater restraint. Iraq's acceptance of the\nunconditional return of the United Nations Monitoring,\nVerification and Inspection Commission is an\nencouraging sign for the peaceful settlement of the\ncrisis. My delegation appeals earnestly to Iraq to\nrespect and comply with the relevant Council\nresolutions.\nTurning to the Korean Peninsula, Guinea supports\nthe efforts for peaceful reunification of the two Koreas,\nin conformity with the declaration signed by the heads\nof State of the two countries in June 2001.\nMy Government reaffirms its attachment to the\nprinciple of one China.\nI now turn to the situation in our subregion, West\nAfrica, an area that has long been shaken by internal\ncrises but that is now moving towards a climate of\npeace and stability. Sierra Leone has committed itself\nto the path of peace and reconciliation, thanks to the\nmediation of the Economic Community of West\nAfrican States (ECOWAS) and to the support of the\nUnited Nations. That success was also made possible\nby the United Kingdom's important role. In Liberia, the\nsituation is still precarious. My delegation remains\nconvinced that the adoption and effective\nimplementation of a programme of disarmament,\ndemobilization and reintegration of armed groups,\nbased on the successful conclusion of the inter-\nLiberian dialogue begun in Abuja, will contribute to\nthe restoration of peace and stability in the subregion.\nGuinea, a member of the Mano River Union, renews its\ncommitment to continuing to work for peace.\nBecause of that commitment, my country took an\nactive part, in the Rabat Summit, on 27 February 2002\nand in the process of implementing its\nrecommendations. The political dialogue at the Summit\nshould be pursued with a view to strengthening\nconfidence between the parties. In that regard, it is\nimportant to point out that the Joint Security\nCommittee of the Mano River Union, which met in\nFreetown on 10 September 2002, decided to\nsimultaneously reopen the borders among the three\ncountries of the Union and to organize a caravan for\npeace next October that will tour those countries. My\ndelegation takes this opportunity to again express its\nprofound gratitude to His Majesty King Mohammed VI\nof Morocco for his mediation. The political dialogue at\nthe Summit and the respect for measures imposed by\nSecurity Council resolution 1343 (2001) represent two\ncomplementary tracks of managing the situation in the\nMano River Basin. The international community, in\nparticular the Council, should ensure follow-up, while\nbearing in mind the interdependence of the situations in\nLiberia and Sierra Leone. The Government of Guinea\nhopes that the establishment of the Office of the\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General for\nWest Africa will contribute to meeting the challenges\nfaced by the States of the subregion. We also welcome\nthe creation of a Security Council Working Group on\nConflict Prevention and Resolution in Africa. Clearly,\nthat initiative is likely to contribute to our common\nreflection on such problems.\nDisarmament issues, particularly those related to\nlight weapons and to anti-personnel mines, remain a\nsource of concern. As members are aware, Guinea\nbelongs to a subregion whose population continues to\nsuffer the adverse effects of the proliferation and the\nillicit circulation of light weapons, which feed\nconflicts, lead to the resurgence of crime and\nencourage the phenomenon of child soldiers.\n18\n\nWe welcome the renewal of the ECOWAS\nMoratorium aimed at eradicating that phenomenon. We\ncall for the implementation of all measures for the\ndismantling of supply networks of small arms and light\nweapons. We support the pursuit of all the activities\nunder way to alleviate the suffering and loss of life\ncaused by anti-personnel mines.\nThe consequences of armed conflicts and natural\ndisasters primarily affect vulnerable civilian\npopulations, which constitute the majority of refugees\nand displaced persons. For more than a decade, Guinea\nhas been hard hit by the negative socio-economic,\nsecurity and environmental impact of wars in Liberia,\nSierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau.\nLet me take this opportunity to reiterate our\nappeal for the holding of a special consultation of the\nUnited Nations on Guinea. In this context, my country\nappreciates the renewed commitment made by the\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) at\nthe workshop held on 18 July 2002 by the Security\nCouncil on the countries of the Mano River Union.\nMy delegation welcomes the creation of the\nRegional Bureau for humanitarian affairs in West\nAfrica, the extension of the rapid response system for\nnatural disasters and the setting up of the integrated\nregional information network.\nPrevention and resolution of conflicts calls for the\nreduction of poverty and eradication of disease. The\nquestion of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis\nremains a source of concern, especially for developing\ncountries, particularly those in Africa. The adoption by\nthe General Assembly of the Millennium Declaration,\nthe declaration of commitment on HIV/AIDS and the\n2001-2010 Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing\nCountries, Particularly in Africa, are significant steps\nforward.\nBut the question of mobilizing resources remains\ncentral to this effort. The primary responsibility for\nmeasures to be taken to implement these initiatives\nfalls to African leaders. However, they need to be\nsupported at the community, national, regional and\ninternational levels.\nMy delegation welcomes the Secretary-General's\ninitiative that led to the creation of the Global Fund to\nFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and other\ntransmittable diseases. One of the commitments made\nby heads of State and Government at the historic\nMillennium Summit was to reduce, if not eliminate,\npoverty. But much of the planet's population is still\nliving in absolute poverty. This situation is aggravated\nby the effects of globalization that, in the absence of\njust and equitable rules, increases the capacity of the\nstrong to promote their interests, while limiting that of\nthe weak.\nThe advent of the African Union illustrates the\nwill of African peoples to achieve the objectives of\neconomic integration and consolidate the foundations\nof peace, stability and security in Africa. In that\nframework the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment (NEPAD) remains an effective\ninstrument for enhancing the African economies and\nbringing about their integration into the world\neconomy. My delegation appeals to the various partners\nto provide effective support in order to make that\ncommon vision a reality.\nWe hope that the decisions of the International\nConference on Financing for Development in\nMonterrey, the commitments of the G-8 in Kananaskis\nand the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit\non Sustainable Development held at Johannesburg will\nhave a positive impact on Africa.\nMy delegation welcomes the improvement of the\nprocedures and methods of work aimed at better\noperation of the General Assembly. We support the\nreform of the Security Council, to adapt it to the\nrequirements of democracy and transparency,\nespecially by increasing the number of its permanent\nand non-permanent members on the basis of a more\nequitable geographical distribution.\nTwo years after the historic Millennium\nDeclaration, the gap between North and South\ncontinues to widen. I wish to express our sincere hope\nfor the advent of a world of greater justice and\nsolidarity in the framework of true partnership for\npeace and development. Accordingly, we remain\nconvinced that the United Nations, reformed,\nrevitalized, adapted to new changes, remains a viable\nframework to face the challenges before us, and thus to\nensure for future generations the conditions necessary\nfor their fulfilment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst, I wish to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your\nelection as President of the fifty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly. Argentina welcomes the fact that a\ndistinguished representative of the Czech Republic has\nbeen given this distinction.\nThe Argentine Republic rejoices with the United\nNations at the entry of Switzerland as a new Member\nof the Organization. The independence of East Timor,\nthe formation of its first sovereign Government and its\ncoming membership in the United Nations are the\nresult of the struggle of that country for its right to self-\ndetermination. We welcome this young nation that is\nnow incorporating into international life.\nArgentina wishes to express its special gratitude\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for\ntranslating, through his actions and his continuing\nsearch for peace, the aspirations of the international\ncommunity striving to build a more secure and stable\nworld.\n26\n\nOne year after the criminal terrorist attacks in the\nUnited States, we reiterate our solidarity with the\npeople and the government of this friendly country, and\nwith the victims and their families. Terrorism is the\nchild of political or religious fanaticism. We are\nconvinced that international cooperation has to be\nstrengthened in the fight against any terrorist threat, so\nas to eliminate that threat, which endangers peace and\ninternational security, and ensure that those responsible\nfor those attacks are tried and punished along with\nthose who help them and support them. There is no\njustification, nor will there be any, for these barbaric\nactions that bring shame upon mankind.\nIt is not a good thing when some Member States\ndo not abide by United Nations resolutions. It is\nintolerable that these resolutions remain\nunimplemented when issues related to the very\nexistence of mankind on the planet are involved. The\nexistence of arsenals with bacteriological, chemical\nand other similar weapons that can be used in a\ntraditional or terrorist war is a matter that affects all\nmen, women and children of the world.\nMy country, along with the rest of the\ninternational community, has consistently called on the\nGovernment of Iraq to accept immediately and\nunconditionally the United Nations inspectors. These\ninspectors represent all of us inspecting one of us.\nThere are no reasons to refuse the inspections if there\nis nothing to conceal.\nTherefore, Argentina welcomes the\nannouncement made by the Secretary-General that Iraq\nfinally agreed to let the inspectors in without\nconditions. We hope that Iraq fulfils its promise in\ngood faith, and we very warmly congratulate the\nLeague of Arab States and the Secretary-General for\nmaking this effort towards peace. The main concern at\nthe United Nations for peacekeeping and for\nmaintaining international security has made significant\nstrides, even though some situations of extreme gravity\nand with high potential for conflict still exist and have\nnot been solved.\nThe promising events related to the establishment\nof the New Partnership for Africa's Development\n(NEPAD) that we discussed yesterday, contrast with\nthe worsening situation in the Middle East. The\nArgentine Government is following with pain and great\nconcern the acts of violence in that region. We are\nconvinced that no possible solution will result from the\nindiscriminate and brutal use of force through\ndeliberate assassinations or through terrorist attacks\nagainst civilians. The only road to peace and stability is\nthrough dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians.\nTherefore we reiterate our position in support of the\nrenewal of negotiations between the parties with the\nhope for coming to a peaceful, fair and definitive\nsolution to the conflict. This should include the\nrecognition of the undeniable right of the Palestinian\npeople to self-determination and to form an\nindependent State, as well as the legitimate right of\nIsrael to live within secure and internationally\nrecognized borders. At present, there are several plans\nfor peace in addition to the efforts on the part of the\nQuartet. All of these initiatives deserve our urgent\nattention.\nAt this time, I wish to confirm that, as part of\nArgentina's dedication to peace, and its desire to\ncontribute to a solution of the serious existing\nconflicts, our country will continue to provide armed\nforces and police personnel, as well as civilians, for the\npeacekeeping operations established by the United\nNations Security Council.\nWe stress again the permanent commitment of\nArgentine democracy to the international protection of\nhuman rights and to the United Nations activities in\nthat field. We wish to mention our satisfaction at the\nentry into force of the Rome Statute, of which\nArgentina is a founding party.\nArgentina today is going through an exceptionally\ndeep crisis. As for the opening of the country to the\nworld, our country will continue to travel along the\npath of becoming a part of the concert of nations that\nexchange goods and services, as it has done\nuninterruptedly for the last 12 years. Therefore we will\ncontinue participating actively in multilateral\nnegotiations within the framework of the World Trade\nOrganization (WTO) and we will implement a new\ntrade policy, which, as part of an overall State policy,\nwill be aimed at giving the Argentine economy a clear\nexport profile. It is only by generating foreign\nearnings, as a result of international trade, that it will\nbe possible to have sustained economic growth over\ntime, while making it possible to repay our debts.\nThe consolidation of this model demands access\nto the currently restricted markets of developed\ncountries for Argentine products. The objective of\nimproving access to markets in industrialized countries\n27\n\nwas, during the Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment held in Monterrey, precisely the subject\nof an absolute consensus, since this undertaking was\nconsidered essential to eradicate poverty and to start on\nthe road to development.\nTo bring prosperity to our peoples it is necessary\nto see these initiatives enacted and not merely\nconsidered as proposals. It is necessary for actions to\nconform, once and for all, to the principles that have\nbeen voiced and the commitments that have been made.\nIt is of great importance that tariffs paid for\nagricultural products be reduced and, simultaneously,\nthat protection mechanisms and subsidies be\neliminated. Such subsidies rose in 2000, within the\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment (OECD) countries rose to the staggering\nfigure of 325 billion dollars with respect to agricultural\nproducts alone. Of these, 80 per cent were granted by\nthe United States, Japan and the European Union.\nIt is essential then that the guidelines towards free\ntrade for agricultural products become a reality,\nallowing the developing countries to stop calling for\naid to help them deal with a specific problem, which\nleads to a vicious circle. As a result, they only increase\ntheir already heavy and unbearable debt. They should\nbe allowed to sustain growth by selling their products.\nIn other words, we wish trade rather than aid.\nThe grave economic situation we are facing has\nmade it difficult for us to fulfil our obligations to this\nOrganization. These difficulties have been presented to\nthe Committee on Contributions, and we hope that it\nwill be adopted by the General Assembly, calling for\nunderstanding from countries that are friends of\nArgentina.\nIn an environment of acute economic and social\ncrisis, the Government of the Argentine Republic has\nreaffirmed its firm commitment, in national and\ninternational forums, towards the purposes and the\nprogrammatic principles of the International\nConvention on the Rights of the Child. This\ninternational agreement, incorporated into our national\nconstitution, is included in the set of values and legal\nstandards that distinguish the Argentine nation.\nMy country has clearly recognized the rights of\nchildren from the time of conception, and stresses the\nimportance of the family in the child's development.\nAlong these same lines we once again insist on the\nright of those children abducted by one of their parents.\nIn particular, we refer to the painful situation of Karim,\nZahira and Sharif, the children of our compatriot\nGabriela Arias Uriburu. Unfortunately, despite huge\nefforts on the part of the family and Argentine officials,\nno answer has been given by the Kingdom of Jordan to\nour request for some mechanism that would make\npossible a stable and permanent relationship between\nthese children and their mother. This position has\nreceived the clear support of the meeting of\ngovernment experts called by the General Assembly of\nthe Organization of American States (OAS) in\nMontevideo, Uruguay.\nThe Argentine Republic believes that the\noutcomes of the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment, recently held in Johannesburg,\nconstitutes a feasible agreement, upon which it is\npossible to move forward in the implementation of\nspecific actions in the economic, social, and\nenvironmental dimensions of sustainable development.\nI regret to say that the most important statement\nat that Summit was made by a group of children, who\nsaid: We ask ourselves whether snow will fall in the\nmiddle of summer one day,' and More than words or\napplause, we need actions.' Unfortunately, little\nspecific progress has been made to stop the continuing\nseries of environmental disasters.\nAs the General Assembly knows well, the\nArgentine Republic has a sovereignty dispute with the\nUnited Kingdom over the Malvinas and South Georgia\nand the South Sandwich Islands, as well as the\nsurrounding maritime areas. The recovery of full\nsovereignty over that part of our national territory,\nwhile respecting the interests of the inhabitants and\ninternational law, is a precept enshrined in the\nArgentine Constitution. The issue was included in the\nprogramme of work of this Organization, which, in\nseveral resolutions, asked the Government of Argentina\nand the Government of the United Kingdom to resume\nnegotiations to find a just and lasting solution to the\nsovereignty dispute, thus ending a colonial situation\nimposed by the use of force in 1833.\nToday, in line with that request, Argentina once\nagain reaffirms its positive disposition to resume\nbilateral negotiations with the United Kingdom to find\na solution to the question and its support of the good\noffices mission that the General Assembly entrusted to\nthe Secretary-General to assist the parties to achieve\nthat goal.\n28\n\nSome three decades ago, in this same Hall, Pope\nPaul VI declared from this same rostrum that\ndevelopment is the new name of peace. That brief and\nwise sentence is fully valid today and points towards\nthe path that we should follow.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI\ncongratulate Mr. Kavan on his election as President of\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. I also\nextend my best wishes to Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan in this first year of his second term in office.\nTwo days ago, we commemorated the first\nanniversary of a terrible event that focused the\ncollective global consciousness on international\nterrorism. Terrorism did not start on 11 September. It\nwas on that day that it brazenly announced itself on the\nglobal stage, flaunting its immunity from distance and\npower.\n15\n\nAs a country exposed to the depredations of\nterrorism for decades, India empathized with the pain\nof the American people, admired their resilience in\ncoming to terms with the consequences and supported\nthe bold decision to counter-attack terrorism at its very\nsource.\nThe international community has taken some\ncollective decisions in the global effort to combat\nterrorism and to choke off its lifelines. Security\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) contains the essence of\nthese decisions. The Council's Counter-Terrorism\nCommittee should now move beyond information\ncompilation and legal assistance to enforcing\ncompliance by States known to be sponsoring,\nsheltering, funding, arming and training terrorists.\nIn our South Asian region, nuclear blackmail has\nemerged over the past few months as a new arrow in\nthe quiver of State-sponsored terrorism. Dark threats\nwere held out that actions by India to stamp out cross-\nborder terrorism could provoke a nuclear war. To\nsuccumb to such blatant nuclear terrorism would mean\nforgetting the bitter lessons of the 11 September\ntragedy.\nAs far as India is concerned, we have repeatedly\nclarified that no one in our country wants a war,\nconventional or otherwise. Nor are we seeking any\nterritory. But absolutely everyone in India wants an end\nto the cross-border terrorism which has claimed\nthousands of innocent lives and denied entire\ngenerations their right to a peaceful existence with\nnormal economic and social activity. We are\ndetermined to end it with all the means at our\ncommand. Let there be no doubt about that in any\nquarter.\nYesterday we heard the extraordinary claim in\nthis Assembly that the brutal murder of innocent\ncivilians in Jammu and Kashmir is actually a freedom\nstruggle and that the forthcoming elections in that state\nare a farce, since they cannot be a substitute for a\nplebiscite demanded over 50 years ago. It requires an\neffort of acrobatic logic to believe that the carnage\namong innocents is an instrument for freedom and that\nelections are a symbol of deception and repression. If\nthe elections are a mere fraud, why are terrorists being\ntrained and infiltrating India at the command of the\nInter-Services Intelligence Agency of Pakistan to kill\nelection candidates and to intimidate voters?\nIf Pakistan claims to be a crucial partner in the\ninternational coalition against terrorism, how can it\ncontinue to use terrorism as an instrument of State\npolicy against India?\n\n\nHow can the international coalition condone\nPakistan-directed killings of thousands of innocent\ncivilians  women and children included  to\npromote a bizarre version of self-determination? Those\nwho speak of underlying or root causes of terrorism\noffer alibis to the terrorists and absolve them of\nresponsibility for their heinous actions, such as the 11\nSeptember attacks on the United States or the 13\nDecember attack on our Parliament.\nYesterday we heard yet another patently false and\nself-serving claim that in India Muslims and other\nminorities are the target of Hindu extremists. With 150\nmillion Muslims, India has the second largest Muslim\npopulation in the world; greater than that of Pakistan.\nWe are proud of the multi-religious character of our\nsociety. Equal respect for all faiths and non-\ndiscrimination on the basis of religion are not just part\nof our Constitutional obligations, but, as the whole\nworld knows, they are the signature theme of India's\ncivilization and culture.\nWe have to recognize that the developmental\ndivide between the North and the South is becoming\nwider and deeper by the day. The challenges that face\nus are stark, and there is no alternative to having all\ncountries of the world join hands to face them together.\nOver the last decade, 10 million people have been\njoining the ranks of the poor each year. A quarter of the\nworld's population lives in extreme poverty.\nWe have to find US$ 24 billion annually for\ninvestment in poor countries, if we are to achieve the\nWorld Food Summit goal of halving hunger by 2015.\nThe continuation of widespread poverty, at a time\nwhen unimaginable wealth is concentrated in a small\nsocial layer, is totally unacceptable. The twenty-first\ncentury has all the means to end this sad legacy of the\npast centuries. What is lacking is the political will\namong the developed countries to sincerely and\nspeedily address the legitimate developmental needs of\nthe developing countries, especially the least developed\nones.\n16\n\nCasting an even longer shadow over this grim\ndevelopmental canvas is global climate change, from\nwhich the poor will most suffer, though they\ncontributed least to it. The recent floods and forest fires\nin Europe are a forewarning that the countries of Asia\nand Africa are not the only victims of the fury of a\ndegraded environment. The Earth's atmosphere and\nbiosphere know no national boundaries. The choice\nbefore the global community is stark: Either we take\nurgent steps to protect the environment or be prepared\nfor far worse natural calamities.\nEarly this month, the Johannesburg Summit for\nSustainable Development debated some of the linkages\nbetween poverty, trade, environment, national,\ninternational and corporate governance and global\nfinancial flows. We emerged from the Summit with\nsome encouraging outcomes, but these fell well short\nof the demands of our time.\nIt has become a categorical imperative to\nunderstand and address man's developmental needs in\ntheir totality, and not in isolated parts. It is\ndisconcerting that the highways of development are\njammed with the noisy and unruly traffic of\nmaterialism and its brash cousin, consumerism. Human\nvalues have become mute bystanders in most political,\neconomic and social activities.\nThe result of this imbalance between our material\nand non-material needs can never be happy for\nmankind. On the contrary, if we are guided by\ncompassion, care, feeling for our fellow human beings,\ncooperation and other human values, we are bound to\nget the right solutions to every problem on our planet.\nHumanity is crying out for a harmonious\nintegration of the economic, social, political,\nenvironmental and spiritual dimensions of\ndevelopment. This task calls for the closest possible\ncooperation among nations and communities, with a\nreadiness to accept the best from every cultural and\nspiritual tradition around the globe. The United Nations\nneeds to take up newer and bigger initiatives in this\ndirection.\nIn this Assembly, less than a year ago, and in the\nUnited States Congress the year before, I had extended\nIndia's offer to coordinate a comprehensive global\ndevelopment dialogue. I reiterate that offer today. If we\nare to achieve the development goals we have promised\nourselves by 2015, we need such a dialogue urgently.\nAs we come together once again at the United\nNations, at a time of new and diverse challenges, we\nshould reflect on our collective commitment to the\nCharter, its purposes and principles. There is a growing\nperception, particularly among the weaker and poorer\ncountries, that responses to issues of far-reaching\nimpact often seem arbitrary and contradictory.\nA common destiny is at stake. The world needs\ncollective multilateralism. It needs the United Nations,\nthe coming together and working together of all its\nnations in the development of a common and collective\nperspective.\nConflicts arise when there is no spirit of\ndemocracy within and among nations. A genuinely\ndemocratic framework enables us to respect alternative\npoints of view, to value diversity and to fashion\nsolutions responsive to the aspirations of people.\nIndia's own experience as a hugely populated and\ndiverse nation shows how complex problems can be\naddressed within a constitutional and democratic\nframework.\nThese values need to be assiduously nurtured in\nour societies, so that at least a future generation is rid\nof the scourge of poverty, intolerance, obscurantism\nand religious extremism.\nDemocratic societies are far less prone to\nideologies based on violence or militarist yearnings,\nsince they do not have their fingers permanently on the\ntrigger of a gun. We have to be vigilant against threats\nto democracy worldwide arising from forces that are\nopposed to it, be they rooted in fundamentalist political\nideologies or extremist religious dogmas.\nAll of us are aware of the challenges. Most of us\nare agreed that a stable global order has to rest on the\nfour strong pillars of peace, security, sustainable\ndevelopment and democracy. We have to ensure that\neach of these pillars is strong and resilient.\nWe are conscious of our collective responsibility.\nIt is the leap from this theoretical understanding to its\npractical realization that we have often failed to\nexecute. We should not fail again. Our future\ngenerations will not forgive us if we do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me begin by\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election as President.\nAll speakers in this debate have reflected on the\nyear that has passed since 11 September 2001. It has\nbeen a very dramatic year, and it is time for the\ninternational community to draw some conclusions\nfrom it. One thing is clear: the United Nations\nresponded quickly and resolutely to the terrorist acts\nagainst the United States. The United Nations acted\nwith speed and determination to counter that threat to\nglobal security.\nFor me, that is yet further proof that the United\nNations is, indeed, indispensable. We all know what\nthe terrorists want: to hurt open societies, to replace\ncooperation with confrontation and to bring down\ndemocracy. But we can never let the terrorists prevail\nin their ambition. Nor can we tolerate the suppression\nof political opposition or the persecution of religious or\nethnic minorities under the guise of combating\nterrorism. In fact, it is by ensuring global respect for\ninternational law, human rights and social justice that\nwe take away much of the fertile ground of terrorism.\n8\n\nThe struggle against terrorism proves once again\nthat multilateral action and a global response are the\nonly sustainable means to meet common challenges.\nFighting terrorism and building peace require\nglobal cooperation. The Secretary-General said last\nweek that when States decide to use force to deal with\nbroader threats to international peace and security, there is\nno substitute for the unique legitimacy provided by the\nUnited Nations. That is true also in the case of Iraq. The\ndefiance of Iraq in the face of the Security Council must\ncome to an end. At the heart of the issue lies the question\nof weapons of mass destruction. They are weapons that\ncan bring suffering and death to millions of people,\nincluding those far away from Iraq.\nWe want to be sure that Iraq fulfils its obligation\nto halt all programmes for developing such weapons.\nWe also want to make sure that any weapons of mass\ndestruction that may already have been developed are\nnow destroyed. That is the task of the United Nations\nweapons inspectors. I welcome the announcement that\nIraq is willing to let the inspectors return, without\nconditions. This time Iraq has to cooperate fully with\nthe United Nations. That will also be the right way to\ngo to achieve the suspension of the sanctions.\nIf that does not happen, however, and if Iraq's\ndefiance continues, as the Secretary-General said, the\nSecurity Council must face its responsibilities. That\ncould be a very delicate decision for the Council; it\nwould need to weigh the risks of various options. But\nthe credibility of the United Nations requires that Iraq\nbe made to fulfil its obligations.\nSustainable development requires global\ncooperation. Throughout the world, poverty and\noppression can be exploited by extremists and can give\nrise to conflict and war. Global cooperation is needed\nto prevent that from happening. International security\nand regional stability require the building of\ndemocracy, respect for human rights, poverty\neradication and sustainable development.\nGlobalization makes it clear that social\nresponsibility is required not only of Governments, but\nalso of companies and individuals \u2014 in short, of all of us.\nEcological sustainability is the basis for human\nsurvival. Development and the environment are\ninterlinked. In Johannesburg, our nations made a\ncommitment to translate into reality the Rio vision \u2014\nthe mutually supportive integration of environmental\nand development goals.\nThe launch of the Doha development agenda\nopens the way for an equitable and responsive global\ntrading system. New global partnerships have changed\nthe way we look at patterns of production, consumption\nand sustainable development, but the goals we have set\nmust be achieved. At Monterrey our common\nresponsibility was confirmed. Strong and efficient\ninstitutions are needed at the local, regional and\ninternational levels to carry out these commitments. We\nneed coherence and consistency. We need ownership.\nOne of the most serious new threats to security is\nHIV/AIDS. Efforts to achieve sustainable development\nwill be in vain if we fail in our fight against HIV/AIDS\nand other diseases that still hold entire populations to\nransom. When the fundamental structures of societies are\ncrumbling due to the devastating effects of epidemics, we\nmust recognize that as a threat to global security.\nThe Millennium Declaration is our reference\nguide. Sweden fully supports the Secretary-General's\ninitiative to launch a strategy for the successful\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals.\nReaching those goals would in itself be the best way to\nprevent violent conflict. Behind the immediate\nsymptoms of conflict, we often find deep-rooted\nstructural causes.\nEven now, however, much more can be achieved\nif diplomatic, economic and military means are used in\na coordinated way. Regional organizations, in\ncooperation with the United Nations, have an important\nrole to play, and the implementation of the Secretary-\nGeneral's report (A/55/985) on the prevention of armed\nconflict is crucial in this respect.\nEnding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict requires\nglobal cooperation. There is an urgent need to put an\nend to the occupation and to the spiral of terrorist acts,\nviolence and confrontation that have caused so much\nsuffering and bloodshed in the Middle East.\nI deeply regret the two recent terrorist attacks in\nIsrael. I strongly urge both parties not to let the peace\nprocess be held hostage by extremists.\nThe future of the region depends on a peaceful,\nsustainable and just solution being reached, based on\ninternational law and the relevant United Nations\nresolutions. One way to achieve this is presented in the\nroad map recently adopted by the European Union,\n9\n\nbuilding on the proposal from the Arab League meeting\nin Beirut. The road map includes the holding of\nelections in the Palestinian territories in January 2003,\naiming at the establishment of a peaceful and\ndemocratic Palestinian State in 2005. The rights of\nIsrael and Palestine to security and statehood cannot be\nsecured by military means. They can be secured only\nby negotiation.\nSafeguarding human rights requires global\ncooperation. Addressing this issue, I wish to begin by\npaying tribute to Mrs. Mary Robinson, the outgoing\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nThrough her strong commitment, she has had an\nimpact. She has made a difference, and we are grateful\nto her. I warmly welcome her successor, Mr. Sergio\nVieira de Mello, and assure him of our continued\ncooperation and support.\nAll human beings are born free and equal in\ndignity and in rights. Still, vast numbers of women,\nmen and children all over the world are deprived of\ntheir declared, inherent and universal human rights.\nHarassment, torture and killings take place daily,\nincluding through abhorrent practices such as genital\nmutilation and stoning. Sometimes the reason for a\nperson's being abused is his or her gender, religion,\nbeliefs, sexual orientation, or the fact that he or she is\ndisabled. We have a duty to act against discrimination.\nThe principles of non-discrimination and diversity are\nfundamental to a humane and decent society. The\nsovereignty of States must never be used as a shield\nbehind which violations of human rights take place.\nThe General Assembly has taken the first step to\nestablish an international convention to promote and\nprotect the rights and dignity of persons with\ndisabilities. This is a very welcome development.\nThe Secretary-General's report (A/57/169) on\nhow to eliminate violence against women and girls\ncommitted in the name of honour is another significant\ncontribution. Legal, protective and other preventive\nmeasures for women and girls at risk should be\naddressed in a concerted manner.\nHuman rights are often spoken about, but we also\nneed to put power behind the words. The creation of the\nInternational Criminal Court is a remarkable achievement\nin the progressive development of international law. Its\nfundamental purpose is to eliminate impunity for crimes\nagainst humanity, genocide and war crimes. We all need\nto carefully safeguard the integrity of the Rome Statute so\nthat its object and purpose will not be undermined. The\nrights of every individual must be respected, and every\nindividual, irrespective of nationality or position in\nsociety, must be held responsible for his or her actions.\nDisarmament of weapons of mass destruction\nrequires global cooperation. International, as well as\nnational, security depends on strong multilateral\nframeworks. Our task is to implement and reinforce the\nimportant international conventions banning or\nregulating weapons of mass destruction. A verification\nregime is necessary to strengthen the Biological and\nToxin Weapons Convention. Failure to reach concrete\nprogress at the Review Conference in November will\nhave serious consequences.\nThe Chemical Weapons Convention provides for\nthe destruction of a whole category of weapons of mass\ndestruction. That is true disarmament, and it should be\nimplemented in a full and timely manner. The\nConvention will be reviewed in April of next year, for\nthe first time in its young history.\nImplementing the agreements made at the Non-\nProliferation Treaty (NPT) review conferences is of\nfundamental importance. That is particularly true for\nthe unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon\nStates to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear\narsenals, and 12 other steps towards accomplishing that\ngoal. As part of the New Agenda Coalition, Sweden will\ncontinue to contribute to this process.\nThe disarmament process should also encompass\nnon-strategic nuclear weapons, as confirmed at the last\nNPT Review Conference. It is vital that the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty enter into\nforce. I call upon all States to adhere to that Treaty.\nThe Conference on Disarmament must start\nsubstantive work when it resumes its session early next\nyear. It is unacceptable that a few countries continue to\nblock progress. Sweden, Algeria, Belgium, Chile and\nColombia recently presented a proposal for a\nprogramme of work that takes into consideration the\ninterests of all parties. I urge China and the United\nStates to actively work for a solution.\nThe challenges ahead of us are neither fewer than\nlast year nor smaller in magnitude. To face them, we need\na modern and more efficient United Nations. A modern\nUnited Nations requires a Security Council that reflects\nthe realities of today's international relations. We need to\nintensify efforts to achieve comprehensive reform of the\n10\n\nSecurity Council. That issue has been discussed for many\nyears, with little success. In the end, it is a question of\nthe credibility and legitimacy of the Organization.\nSweden favours enlargement of the Security\nCouncil to make room for increased representation of\nMember States, not least developing States. We would\nlike to see such a reform have the broadest possible\nsupport. If this entailed, as a first step, an enlargement\nlimited to non-permanent members, while not\nexcluding new permanent members at a later stage,\nSweden would support such a solution. An immediate\nincrease would better reflect the realities of today's\ninternational community and the growing number of\nMember States.\nLet me finish by greeting Switzerland, one of the\nhost countries of the United Nations and warmly\nwelcoming it as a full Member of the United Nations.\nShortly, the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, a\ncountry where this Organization has been deeply and\npositively involved, will also become a new member of\nthe United Nations family. I see significance in this. I\nsee proof that joint and integrated efforts by the\ninternational community can produce remarkable\nresults. It fills me with hope that the United Nations\nhas, in fact, entered this millennium with vigour and\ndetermination.\nI am convinced that the United Nations is on the\nright track. Through joint efforts by all of us, the\nUnited Nations will continue to be a beacon of hope for\nhumanity in the twenty-first century.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish\nat the outset to extend to you, Sir, and to your friendly\ncountry, the Czech Republic, warm congratulations on\nyour election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-seventh session. Your record of\nprudence and diplomatic skill will certainly be\ninstrumental in meeting the lofty goals sought by all\nnations and peoples. A word of thanks and tribute goes\nto your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Han\nSeung-soo, for his outstanding stewardship of the fifty-\nsixth session.\nTwo States are being admitted to the membership\nof our Organization: the Swiss Confederation and,\nsoon, the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste. Despite\n9\n\ntheir differing histories, each will strengthen the fabric\nand enrich the tapestry of the United Nations. Jordan\nbids a warm welcome to both of them and wishes them\nwell.\nThe opening of the current session coincided with\nthe first anniversary of the heinous terrorist attacks\nagainst New York City, Washington, D.C., and\nPennsylvania. As I reiterate Jordan's condemnation of\nthose terrorist acts, let me express once again our deep\ncondolences and sympathy to the families of the\nthousands of victims who lost their lives as a result of\nthe cowardly and criminal acts that targeted our\nOrganization's host city and host nation. The list of\nvictims is multinational, multi-ethnic, multi-religious\nand multicultural. That graphically illustrates the fact\nthat terrorism is indeed blind to all those criteria. The\ninternational community rose to the occasion when it\nprovided a prompt, collective, decisive response.\nIndeed, it was the United Nations itself that provided\nthe forum for a global coalition underpinned by both\nour common political will and the compelling case\nbefore us. Thus, the Assembly adopted resolution 56/1,\nwhile the Security Council adopted its resolutions 1368\n(2001) and 1373 (2001). That set of decisions,\nembraced by our world body, which represents all\nhuman cultures, ideologies and ethnicities, created the\nofficial platform for launching the ongoing global\ncampaign against terrorism.\nMy country, Jordan, has also suffered from\nterrorism and its evils. Terrorists have struck at our\nnational symbols, our citizens and our interests because\nof our principled positions, foremost among them our\nfirm commitment to fight terrorism. All along, Jordan\nhas been in the vanguard of every international effort\naimed at hunting down this plague and confronting it,\nincluding by draining its resources as part of an overall\ndrive to uproot it altogether.\nIn parallel, Jordan's stance is clear-cut and\ndecisive. We reject and condemn terrorism in all its\nforms and manifestations. We have declared in no\nuncertain terms this firm conviction against terrorism,\nirrespective of its source, the perpetrators or the\nidentity of the victims. Furthermore, we allow no room\nfor any justification whatsoever, including any possible\narguments on religious, ethnic or national grounds.\nThus, Jordan treats all forms of terrorism as criminal\nacts.\nIn the same context, let me stress our conviction\nthat the eradication of terrorism is a common goal of\nall States and societies. I wish therefore to draw the\nAssembly's attention to the blatant tendency, driven by\npernicious and wicked intentions, to falsely link\nterrorism to a specific religion or culture. I trust that\nthis gathering shares my view that it is now imperative\nto confront these dubious attempts. Indeed, dealing\nwith such schemes is indispensable if we are to\nmaintain the sustained and concerted campaign to\nachieve the paramount objective: the total eradication\nof terrorism.\nThe current situation in the Middle East is\nextremely dangerous. The whole landscape is\nconstantly changing for the worse, especially in the\noccupied Palestinian territories. Israel's reoccupation\nof the Palestinian Authority's territories and the\nperpetuation of this occupation, together with the\nmeasures and policies emanating thereof, particularly\npolicies of closure and siege, have created intolerable\nliving conditions for the Palestinian people. These\nunbearable conditions have prompted several\nhumanitarian agencies and international organs to\ndeclare a state of emergency. Israeli measures to\nstrangle the Palestinian people economically and\npolitically, with a view to bringing the Palestinians to\ntheir knees and to coercing them into surrendering their\nrights, have reached inadmissible levels of seriousness.\nMalnutrition rates among the Palestinian population\nhave doubled. Diseases related to malnutrition and\nhunger have become widespread, particularly among\nchildren, women and the elderly. The joint impact of all\nthese factors has created breeding grounds for\nfrustration and despair, which inevitably generate\nhatred, grudges and violence.\nTherefore, this situation must be addressed\neffectively and expeditiously. We hope that the first\nmove will come from Israel in the form of ending its\noccupation of Palestinian towns without delay. We also\nexpect Israel to cease forthwith its policies of closures\nand siege. It is in Israel's interest to pursue\nconstructive policies towards the Palestinians in order\nto restore mutual confidence and to rehabilitate the\nvalues of reconciliation and coexistence between the\ntwo peoples. It is our considered view that Israel's\ncurrent approach is irrational, as it results in excessive\nuse of force, which in turn fuels and deepens hatred\nand replenishes the sources of violence.\n10\n\nWhile we welcome the few visible signs of relief,\nas reflected in the accord reached by the Palestinian\nand Israeli sides on 19 August 2002, which calls for\nprogressive withdrawal by Israel from certain\nPalestinian towns that have been reoccupied by Israel,\nwe call on Israel to implement faithfully and\nexpeditiously Security Council resolution 1402 (2002),\nwhich provides for full Israeli withdrawal from all\nPalestinian cities.\nFrom a political and humanitarian point of view,\nJordan stands against targeting Israeli civilians and\nconcurs with the need to address the whole spectrum of\nsecurity issues. However, it maintains that the only\nviable course for addressing the Palestinian-Israeli\nquestion lies in the resumption of the peace process as\na whole, from the point where it stalled and within the\nagreed framework established on the basis of complete\nIsraeli withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied\nsince 1967, including the Palestinian, Syrian and\nLebanese territories; the establishment of an\nindependent Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as\nits capital, pursuant to relevant Security Council\nresolutions, particularly 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 425\n(1978) and 1397 (2002).\nIn that context, I wish to stress the significance of\nthe initiative adopted by the Arab leaders at the Beirut\nArab Summit last March. That initiative outlined a\nbalanced approach in terms of practical ideas and\narguments that demonstrate beyond any doubt a\ngenuine pan-Arab commitment to just, lasting and\ncomprehensive peace. That plan is a pledge by Arab\nStates to conclude peace agreements with Israel in\nreturn for its complete withdrawal from the Palestinian,\nSyrian and Lebanese territories to the 4 June 1967\nborders, the establishment of an independent\nPalestinian State with East Jerusalem its capital and\nfinding a just and agreed solution to the Palestinian\nrefugees question on the basis of the relevant United\nNations resolutions.\nI trust that the Government of Israel will rise to\nthe level of the hopes and aspirations of the Arab\npeoples and the people of Israel to live in peace, justice\nand dignity. We hope that the Government of Israel will\nbe forthcoming in response to that balanced and sincere\ninitiative, which gained the acceptance of all States and\nparties interested in the peace process. Furthermore,\nthis initiative is also in line with the vision and the\ncommitment outlined by President George W. Bush of\nthe United States on the form and aim of a final\nsolution on the Palestinian-Israeli track based on the\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian state\nexisting alongside the State of Israel by mid-2005 at\nthe latest.\nIn that regard, Jordan supports efforts being made\nto draw up a clear road map leading to the\nimplementation of President Bush's commitment\nthrough, first, defining the obligations of both the\nPalestinian and Israeli sides; secondly, setting a clear\ntimetable for all phases of carrying out those\nobligations so that the deadline for the birth of the\nindependent Palestinian State will not, under any\ncircumstances, extend beyond mid-2005; and, thirdly,\nagreeing to the creation of an international supervisory\nmechanism that ensures the timely and orderly\nimplementation of those measures as well as\nmonitoring the implementation process.\nWe hope that this vision will be examined at the\nQuartet meeting in New York within the next few days,\nwith a view to adopting it into a plan of action and a\ncomprehensive international obligation. Subsequently,\nthe parties will embark on the implementation process\nwithin the specified framework, whose outcome will be\nthe establishment of an independent Palestinian State\nwithin less than three years. We also hope that this\nachievement will generate a fresh impetus to conclude\ncomprehensive peace on the Syrian-Israeli and\nLebanese-Israeli tracks within the same time frame.\nIn compliance with the United Nations principles\nenshrined in the Charter, particularly Article 2,\nparagraph 4, which prohibits the threat or use of force\nin international relations, and considering that this right\nis exclusively assigned to the Security Council so that\nthe Council may exercise it in case of a breach of\ninternational peace and security, Jordan believes that\nthe most appropriate means for resolving the matters\noutstanding between the United Nations and Iraq is to\nensure the immediate and full implementation of all\nrelevant Security Council resolutions, including those\nrelating to Kuwaiti prisoners and missing persons as\nwell as to the return of the weapons inspectors. If these\nconditions are met, the people of Iraq, who have been\nsuffering for too long, would be saved from military\naction that would exacerbate that suffering. The\naforementioned formula would also spare the entire\nregion the dire consequences of military operations.\nIn the context of emphasizing the principle of\nresolving disputes by peaceful means, we invite the\n\n\nIslamic Republic of Iran to respond to the call made by\nthe United Arab Emirates to reach a peaceful\nsettlement of the problem of the three islands. We urge\nIran to accept referral of this case to the International\nCourt of Justice. We also encourage the efforts made\nby the two sides in Cyprus to reach a just and peaceful\nsolution to the Cypriot question. We also call for the\npeaceful resolution of the dispute between India and\nPakistan over Kashmir. We have no doubt that the\nAssembly will support and strengthen those efforts.\nJordan recognizes the nature of the\ntransformations that have taken place in international\nrelations and the global landscape over the past decade.\nThus, we stress the need for the United Nations to\nadapt accordingly, through effective streamlining, so\nthat it will maintain its relevance as the primary\ninternational forum of global cooperation and\ncoordination in all human fields. A robust United\nNations would also remain the true embodiment of the\nhopes and the aspirations of all mankind.\nHere, I wish to pay special tribute to Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan for the foresight, dynamism and\nflexibility he brings into play while performing his\nduties. Those fine personal qualities enhance his\nimpressive performance, which Jordan supports and\nappreciates.\nIn closing, I would like to warmly welcome the\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court and\nthe entry into force of its Statute. Our expectation is\nthat the Court will enhance the great principles and\npurposes of the United Nations itself. Let me underline\nour absolute support for all efforts aimed at\nstrengthening and revitalizing the United Nations\nsystem, including the ongoing structural reform\nexercise and the review of Security Council\nmembership with a view to its expansion in order to\nmake it more representative of the new international\nrealities. Finally, I wish the Assembly all success in its\ndeliberations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is my pleasure to join\nwith preceding speakers in congratulating you, Sir, on\nyour election to preside over the General Assembly at\nits fifty-seventh session. Barbados pledges its fullest\ncooperation in the year ahead.\nI also take this opportunity to convey our deepest\nappreciation to Mr. Han Seung-soo for his leadership\nduring a very challenging fifty-sixth session.\nWe, too, wish to welcome the Swiss Confederation\nand look forward to the Democratic Republic of Timor-\nLeste's joining this family of nations.\nThe Preamble to the Charter of this Organization\nexpresses in the simplest yet most eloquent of terms\nthe essential goals of multilateralism. We know its\nevery phrase and recognize its solemn commitment\n\u201cto promote social progress and better standards\nof life in larger freedom\u201d\nas well as\n\u201cto practice tolerance and live together in peace\nwith one another as good neighbours and to unite\nour strength to maintain international peace and\nsecurity\u201d.\nThese goals remain as relevant today, and yet, in many\nways, as painfully elusive as they were in 1945.\nIn January 2001, the international community\nushered in a new century with the highest of\nexpectations for the successful implementation of the\nmillennium development goals, which we had just\nadopted. We were resolved to work with renewed\nvigour to eradicate poverty and hunger, fight the\nscourge of HIV/AIDS and disease, raise the level of\nhuman development and bring an end to debilitating\neconomic and social injustices. Tragically, the events\n29\n\nof 11 September 2001 eclipsed our millennium vision\nand brutally reshaped the global agenda.\nIn the intervening year, we have been forced to\nre-examine our traditional notions of security and to\ncome to terms with the reality of our growing political\nand economic interdependence. For no single nation\ncan hope to have all the answers to the complex issues\nthat confront us and no lasting solutions are possible\nexcept through collective effort. If nothing else, the\nlessons of 11 September have served to reinforce the\nvalue of multilateralism.\nFor the past several years, Barbados has argued\nfor a redefinition of the concept of security to embrace\nthe new and non-traditional threats that have the\ngreatest potential to cause harm to our citizens,\ndestabilize our societies and erode the basic institutions\nof governance. At the hemispheric level, we promoted\ndialogue on these issues among foreign ministers of the\nOrganization of American States at our recent General\nAssembly session in Barbados, where we adopted the\nDeclaration of Bridgetown on the multidimensional\napproach to hemispheric security. We believe that this\napproach to security is equally valid in the wider\ninternational context.\nAs we are well aware, threats to world peace are\nno longer exclusively found in military conflict\nbetween opposing countries, where the enemy is\nrecognized and a state of war formally declared.\nToday's greatest sources of instability and threats to\nnational, regional and international security lie in areas\nwhere the enemies are often unidentified non-State\nactors with global reach. Terrorism is but one of those\ninsidious new elements. We are equally alarmed by the\ngrowing danger posed to democratic societies and\nGovernments by the modern transnational phenomena\nof narco-trafficking, organized crime, money-\nlaundering, corruption and illicit trafficking in small\narms and light weapons. We are also aware of the\npotential for grave economic and social dislocation\nposed by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, environmental\ndegradation and ecological and natural disasters. In\naddition, the inequitable application of the benefits of\ntrade liberalization has created the very real prospect of\nincreasing poverty and further economic\ndisenfranchisement for the smallest and most vulnerable\ncountries in the developing world. Under the\ncircumstances, we have little choice but to persist in the\nstruggle to gain international acceptance for our demands\nfor special and differential treatment to prepare our small\neconomies to meet the challenges of globalization.\nModern threats to international peace and security\nconstrain the capacity for political and economic\ndevelopment and social progress. All nations share in\nthe responsibility to respond to those threats, but we\ncan only do so successfully through collective\nstrategies, which address all aspects of the problem\nsimultaneously. Diversion of resources and attention\nfrom the development agenda to the fight against\nterrorism cannot produce lasting results. As Dr.\nBrundtland warned in 1992, our global village may yet\nbecome a global jungle if States adopt unilateral\nmeasures to combat global problems.\nSmall developing countries are beset daily by\nfundamental challenges to their economic\nsustainability. From our perspective, security has of\nnecessity revolved around policies in support of social\ndevelopment, economic viability, good governance and\nthe promotion of democracy. For us, military\nengagement is not an affordable option.\nFor Barbados, as for all small States, the doctrine\nof non-intervention is of paramount importance for our\nsurvival. Pre-emptive unilateral action, no matter what\nthe apparent cause, is a precedent that occasions in us\nthe gravest discomfort. It is, therefore, vital that, at this\ndangerous and uncertain juncture in world affairs, we\nreaffirm our commitment to multilateralism and to the\npre-eminent role of the United Nations in seeking to\nimpose responsible behaviour through diplomacy and\ndialogue rather than through the use of force.\nIn response to the events of 11 September and to\nthe mandates of Security Council resolution 1373\n(2001), Barbados has deployed considerable financial\nand human resources to the anti-terrorism effort. In\nMay this year, our Parliament adopted comprehensive\ndomestic legislation, which entailed an amendment to\nour Constitution, to criminalize acts of terrorism and\nsupport or financing for such acts. Yesterday I\ndeposited with the United Nations Secretariat the\nrelevant instruments to make Barbados a party to the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of\nTerrorist Bombings and the International Convention\nfor the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.\nWe have been prompt and responsible in fulfilling\nour obligations to the international community in that\nregard, despite the heavy financial strain that has\nplaced on our national economy, already deeply\n30\n\naffected by the adverse impact of 11 September on its\nmajor productive sectors \u2014 tourism and financial\nservices. As I reminded the General Assembly last\nyear, small countries like my own are not part of the\nproblem, but we are committed to being part of the\nsolution, in circumstances that place a disproportionate\nburden on our financial, human and administrative\nresources, already struggling to respond to the global\neconomic recession.\nRegrettably, that burden has been further\nexacerbated by the words and actions of some\nlawmakers who now seek, through misguided zeal, to\nbrand the operations of financial services centres, even\nthe most transparent and well regulated, such as the\nBarbados regime, as havens for corporate tax evasion\nand for the laundering of terrorist assets. It is important\nto emphasize that the Barbados jurisdiction is more\ntransparent and better regulated than many in the\ndeveloped world, and certainly no less so than what\nobtains in the states of Delaware and Vermont, among\nothers. My country fully intends to defend its\nreputation against those renewed, unwarranted,\nduplicitous and discriminatory attacks.\nIn this post-11 September, post-Doha, post-Enron\nworld, many of the assumptions about peace and\nprogress in a globalized economy have been\nchallenged. We have entered a prolonged international\nrecession, whose consequences have impacted on all\ncountries. It is trying times such as these that force\npolicy makers at the national level to simplify, refocus\nand prioritize.\nIt is opportune for us to undertake a similar\nexercise in respect of the United Nations. We must\nreturn this Organization to its basic mandate, and seek\nto have its energies and focus redirected towards\nsubstantive action in the twin areas of peace and\ndevelopment. The unique attributes of the United\nNations and its multilateral structure can serve to build\nconsensus and promote cooperation in the search for\nsolutions to the most pressing problems affecting\nhuman security.\nThe international summits and global\nconferences, which have proliferated over the last\ndecade, have been successful in mobilizing\nGovernments and, to a greater extent, civil society, as\nwell as sensitizing people to the most compelling\ndevelopment issues facing the planet. Although they\nhave created awareness and raised expectations, they\nhave not delivered with respect to implementation, and\nmost of their fiercely negotiated plans of action remain\nunder-funded and under-executed. The promises and\npledges of the past 15 years have not been fulfilled. It\nis high time that we review the utility of those costly\nprocesses and seek simpler, more effective structures to\ncarry forward our development agenda. The dwindling\nresources available for developmental programmes are\nbetter used for development itself than for scripted\ndialogue to discuss the process of development.\nFundamental changes are needed in the way that\ndevelopment is financed, and in the structure, operation\nand coherence of the global financial architecture.\nMonterrey must not become just another failed process.\nBarbados welcomed recognition by the World\nSummit on Sustainable Development of the vulnerability\nand sustainable development challenges of small island\ndeveloping States, and looks forward to a frank,\ncomprehensive review of the implementation of the\nBarbados Plan of Action in Mauritius in 2004. The\nSummit made a commitment to the sustainable\nmanagement of ocean space, and it is in this vein that\nBarbados will continue to work towards achieving\ninternational recognition of the Caribbean Sea as a\n\u201cspecial area\u201d in the context of sustainable development.\nFor Barbados, our greatest resource lies in the\ncreativity and resilience of our people. We are\npersuaded that the betterment of the human condition is\nthe fundamental objective of economic progress. The\nHIV/AIDS pandemic rates with terrorism and narco-\ntrafficking as one of the major new and emerging\nthreats to human security. According to information\nprovided by the Pan American Health Organization,\nthere are currently 2.8 million people living with\nHIV/AIDS in the Americas. Of that number, 420,000\nlive in the wider Caribbean, accounting for over 2 per\ncent of its adult population. In response to the\ninternational Declaration of Commitment, Barbados\nhas established a target of a 50 per cent reduction in the\nHIV/AIDS mortality rate and in the incidence of the\ndisease over the next three years. We are also working\ntowards the enactment of appropriate anti-\ndiscriminatory legislation by 2006. Our National\nCommission continues to support the Pan-Caribbean\nPartnership against HIV/AIDS, which is coordinated\nby the Caribbean Community Secretariat. Barbados is\none of four English-speaking Caribbean countries\nselected to participate in the Caribbean HIV/AIDS\nRegional Training Initiative. The World Bank, of\n31\n\nwhose programmes Barbados is a graduate, made\nspecial provisions for the securing of a $15.1 million\nloan to procure the highly active anti-retroviral therapy\nprogramme for HIV-positive Barbadians, free of cost at\npoint of delivery.\nBarbados' commitment to the principles and\npurposes of the United Nations Charter has been\nunwavering over its three and a half decades of\nmembership in this Organization. We have paid our\ncontributions faithfully and have consistently\nsupported the Organization's efforts to promote and\nprotect human rights, to eradicate poverty and to\ncultivate a global culture of peace.\nA tangible demonstration of that commitment was\nmade on 2 January of this year, when the Prime\nMinister of Barbados had the honour of officially\nhanding over to the United Nations Secretary-General,\nfor the exclusive use of the United Nations agencies\noperating in the Eastern Caribbean, a custom-designed\ncommon premises building, now known as United\nNations House. Secretary-General Annan's personal\npresence in Barbados for the inauguration ceremony\nwas interpreted by Prime Minister Arthur as a clear\nexpression of his understanding that every part of the\nUnited Nations family matters and that the contribution\nof the small States of the Caribbean to the objectives of\nthe Organization is not without significance. For in the\nwords of the Secretary-General, small States have become\nthe backbone of the Organization in terms of their support\nand encouragement for the multilateral process.\nThe principles which guarantee a better quality of\nlife for all peoples lie within our Charter. The global\nlandscape has undergone tremendous change in the last\n57 years, but the ideals of the Charter are indelible.\nToday we revisit this place to recommit to a process\nwhich, admittedly, is not perfect, but it is all that stands\nbetween us and anarchy. It is still our greatest hope for\npeace, development and social justice. In our\ngeneration, we cannot be expected to complete the\nmonumental task which lies before us, but neither are\nwe at liberty to abstain from it."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at the outset to congratulate the President on\nhis election to the presidency of this session of the\nGeneral Assembly and to wish him every success in\ndischarging his functions. Because of the profound\nfriendship that exists between Tunisia and the Czech\nRepublic, we assure him of our cooperation and support\nas he conducts the business of this session. I would also\nlike to take this opportunity to convey our thanks to his\npredecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, who conducted the\nlast session's work so ably and effectively.\nIt gives me pleasure to express our appreciation\nand gratitude to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is\nconstantly playing a constructive and effective role in\nthe service of the noble goals of our Organization.\nI would like to extend Tunisia's congratulations\nto the Swiss Confederation on its admission to\nmembership in the United Nations.\nThe various repercussions of the events of 11\nSeptember last, that we have all vigorously\ncondemned, continue to be felt and to remind the\nmembers of the international community that\nstrengthening our common action is essential for\nmeeting the security and development challenges\nconfronting our world today. These challenges must be\ndealt with through increased discussion, cooperation\nand solidarity, on the basis of a global, integrated\nvision of the future. The establishment of a link\nbetween security and development, as well as a delicate\nunderstanding of the dialectic that exists between these\ntwo elements, make it possible not only to find an\neffective solution to certain international problems but\nalso to prevent their occurring.\nThe global vision that we advocate as a modus\noperandi at the international level is basically built on\nstrengthened values of understanding and interaction\namong religions, civilizations and cultures, on\nenshrining the principles of solidarity, moderation and\ntolerance, on poverty eradication, combating exclusion\nand marginalization; a vision that requires a collective\nstand against fanaticism and terrorism.\nThese principles and values are based on the\ncivilizational plan that His Excellency President Zine\nEl Abidine Ben Ali has constantly advocated during\nthis new era in Tunisian society. This plan was\nstrengthened following the essential constitutional\nreform, which was unanimously adopted for the people\nof Tunisia during a referendum and during which the\npeople opted for a Republic of tomorrow, based on the\nrule of law and institutions, the protection of human\nrights and solidarity among members of our society.\nThe successes and achievements gained in our\ncountry, thanks to this integrated global approach that\nwe have adopted to redress the social, economic,\npolitical and cultural situation of the Tunisian people,\nhave strengthened our conviction that international\nrelations must be based on the same approach for the\nwell-being of humanity at large and for meeting the\nchallenges we are facing today.\nTunisia has on a number of occasions submitted\nseveral initiatives, in particular the appeal made in\n1989 from this rostrum by His Excellency Mr. Zine El\nAbidine Ben Ali, President of the Republic, for a\nuniversal covenant of peace and progress, laying down\nthe foundation of a better future for the international\ncommunity in a spirit of constructive cooperation,\nimmune to conflicts and to wastage of resources and\nenergy.\nTunisia believes that it is time to hold an\ninternational conference to draft common denominators\nthat would provide a basis for a code of conduct to be\nobserved by all parties. This code would help to initiate\n22\n\na responsible dialogue that would avoid any double\nstandards and would attenuate any feelings of\ndeprivation or oppression felt by many peoples. We\nbelieve that the United Nations would be the ideal\nforum to develop and sponsor this kind of dialogue\namong States.\nOne year after the painful events that shook the\nUnited States, the danger of terrorism is still felt, and it\ncontinues to pose a threat to international peace and\nsecurity. We therefore have to demonstrate constant\nresolve in the face of this phenomenon in our attempts\nto eradicate it once and for all. Now that the most\nobvious manifestations of terrorism have been dealt with,\nthe international community must tackle its causes which\nare linked to security, development and culture.\nTunisia was one of the first countries to warn\nabout the dangers of terrorism, well before the events\nof 11 September. At the beginning of the 1990s, we were\nin favour of coordinated, international efforts to deal with,\ncontain and eliminate this scourge. It is disquieting that\ncertain terrorists are still present in many countries and\nenjoy protection under the pretext of granting them the\nright of political asylum, without any inquiry into their\nactions, their activities or the crimes that they\ncommitted against their countries of origin.\nMany regions of the world still suffer the horrors\nof poverty and destitution. Only through a focused,\ncareful approach to achieve the Millennium Goals,\nwhich were reaffirmed at several subsequent\ninternational conferences, will it be possible to resolve\nthis situation. Tunisia had already adopted an initiative\nalong these lines by proposing the creation of a world\nsolidarity fund to combat poverty in the world. Two\nyears after this initiative was put forward, and after its\nadoption by the General Assembly, and following the\ndecision taken by the World Summit for Sustainable\nDevelopment that discussed setting up this fund, we\nhope now that the research and studies conducted in\nthis framework, particularly the latest report of the\nUnited Nations Secretary-General on modalities for the\nfunctioning of and the use of such a fund, will make it\npossible for the fund to come into being this year.\nPoverty eradication is a crucial element in\nguaranteeing the stability of societies and preventing\nother scourges, such as wars, terrorism and diseases,\nparticularly since this is basic to any global strategy\nthat guarantees international peace and security.\nAfrica continues to suffer from conflicts and from\neconomic and development problems and requires\nconstant attention from the international community.\nMany analyses have proven that the instability of the\ncontinent is basically due to Africa's economic and\nsocial problems. Many international meetings and\nsummits have also confirmed this. The New\nPartnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) is an\ninitiative that might draw the attention of donor States\nand the attention of international financial institutions\nto this situation.\nWe believe that if the international community\nwants Africa to have a bright future, it cannot continue\nto disregard its basic needs or subject it to mere\ngeostrategic considerations, or, indeed, tie international\naid to harsh conditions that many African States cannot\nfulfil.\nThe international community must now play a\nprominent role in prevailing upon Israel to halt its\naggression against the Palestinian people, withdraw\nfrom the occupied territories and abide by international\nlaw on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242\n(1967), 338 (1973) and other relevant resolutions, as well\nas on the basis of the principle of \u201cland for peace\u201d.\nThe Palestinian people need the unflagging\nsupport of the international community so that it can\nrecover its legitimate rights, primarily its right to create\na State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. Israel's\npolicy of assassinating Palestinian leaders, of\nmaintaining a blockade against the legitimate President\nYasser Arafat, of starving civilians, and of massacring\npeople and expelling them from their land in violation\nof the Fourth Geneva Convention only worsens this\nsituation and fans resentment and a desire for revenge.\nThe international community must redouble its\nefforts to bring about a return to the negotiating table\nin order to give real meaning to the vision of two\nStates, Palestine and Israel, living side by side within\nsecure recognized borders, as advocated by President\nBush in his speech made in June 2002, and on the basis\nof the comprehensive approach advocated by the Arab\nplan adopted at the recent Arab Summit in Beirut.\nTunisia has always worked for peace in the\nMiddle East. We have taken part in the multilateral\nnegotiations and today are ready to continue our\nconstructive role for the resumption of talks and the\nestablishment of a just, comprehensive and lasting\npeace that will guarantee the liberation of Arab\n23\n\nterritories still occupied by Israel since 1967, including\nthe Syrian Golan and the remainder of the Lebanese\nterritory still under Israeli occupation.\nFurthermore, lasting peace and stability for all the\npeoples of the Middle East requires continued\ninternational efforts to make progress on the question\nof Iraq through peaceful means and by implementing\nrelevant Security Council resolutions.\nWe believe that dialogue between the United\nNations and Iraq remains the best way to resolve all\noutstanding Iraqi issues.\nWe welcome, in this regard, Iraq's decision to\naccept the return of the weapons inspectors without\nconditions. This is, as was noted by the Secretary-\nGeneral at the beginning of our session, a step towards\nd\u00e9tente in the region and the lifting of sanctions.\nTunisia supports the Arab position that rejects\nattacks against any Arab country and any further\nsuffering and harm to the brotherly Iraqi people. Our\nposition also supports maintaining the sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity of Iraq, as well as the sovereignty\nand territorial integrity of the State of Kuwait, while\nstressing the need to avoid any destabilization of\nsecurity there.\nWe wish to reaffirm the need to lift, once and for\nall, the sanctions against sisterly Libya, which has\nfulfilled all its commitments and has offered its full\ncooperation towards finding a just and satisfactory\nsolution to the Lockerbie case.\nThe global vision of peace and security in the\nworld is no less important at the regional level, which\ncomplements and supports joint international action.\nTunisia considers the Arab Maghreb Union as a\nstrategic choice and we have continuously worked to\nconsolidate it and to remove obstacles that have\nimpeded its progress. We hope that joint Maghreb\naction will lead to greater integration among the\ncountries of the Union.\nOn the regional level, Tunisia is working to deepen\nits relations of cooperation and partnership in the Euro-\nMediterranean region. We welcome the reactivation of the\n\u201cFive plus Five\u201d forum, which will lead to greater\nopportunities to promote dialogue, cooperation and\nsolidarity between the two shores of the Mediterranean\nand will strengthen elements of peace, stability, and\ndevelopment. In this manner, relations may develop\namong countries of this forum in a spirit of mutual\nrespect, while preserving the interest of all parties.\nTunisia will work on this basis and do everything\nit can to guarantee the success of the \u201cFive plus Five\u201d\nsummit, which we will be hosting in 2003.\nThe considerable technological advances\nwitnessed today definitely have an impact on\ninternational economic recovery. Mindful of the\nimportance of this issue, Tunisia was one of the first\ncountries to call for the holding of a summit on\ninformation technology, an idea that was unanimously\nsupported by all international parties. Tunisia will have\nthe honour of hosting the World Summit on the\nInformation Society in 2005. We hope that the General\nAssembly will continue to help prepare the\ngroundwork in order to make it a success.\nIn this context, we would like to stress the need to\nfacilitate the transfer of clean technology to developing\ncountries and to promote means of cooperation among\nNorth-South and South-South countries, as well as to\nstrengthen financial cooperation in order to provide\nadditional funding to projects relating to environmental\nprotection in the developing countries.\nThe subjects discussed in Johannesburg and the\nmatters discussed at the International Conference on\nFinancing for Development in Monterrey, as well as\nthe subjects dealt with in the WTO conference in Doha\nshould complement one another. In the interest of all\ncountries, particularly the developing countries,\nglobalization must be made a factor for progress for\neveryone as well as a factor for strengthening peace\nand security.\nToday's world promises new hopes and ambitions\nbut also contains threats and challenges, the\nimplications of which should be understood. Tunisia's\nmessage to this Assembly is that we should work\ntogether to draw up an act of international partnership\nin all fields based on an international code of conduct\nfor all parties, in the political, economic, development,\nsecurity and stability fields.\nThe principles that unite us in promoting the\nmajor priorities and preventing new dangers to\ninternational peace and security should impel us to\nadopt a preventive approach based, first, on respect for\nthe principle of international law as the basis for\npeaceful coexistence; secondly, on providing equal\nopportunities for all developing countries without any\n24\n\nexclusion or marginalization and thirdly, on resolving\ninternational problems, conflicts, crises or wars on the\nbasis of established principles of justice and in keeping\nwith international law.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI bring warm greetings from\nthe people of Nauru, who join me in congratulating\nyou, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the\nfifty-seventh session of the General Assembly, and in\ncommending the outgoing President for his strong\nleadership and guidance throughout the tumultuous\nyear gone by.\nMy delegation takes this opportunity to\ncongratulate Switzerland on becoming a full member\nof the United Nations, making it the 190th Member\nState in this brotherhood of nations.\nMuch of the work of the United Nations since the\nlast session of the General Assembly is reflective of the\nstate of the world. The events of 11 September 2001\nand the ongoing conflicts around the world have\nfocused the work of this body on security issues, and\nthat is understandable. The Security Council's adoption\nof its resolution 1373 (2001), obligating Member States\nto implement anti-terrorism measures, has the full\nsupport of the countries of the Pacific Island Forum, of\nwhich we are a member.\nAt the international level, my Government is\npleased with the outcome of the first session of the\nAssembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court, which concluded only a\nfew days ago.\nWe commend with admiration the United Nations\noperation in East Timor for successfully nursing an\noccupied territory and its people from despair to\nnationhood, with the proclamation of an independent\nDemocratic Republic of East Timor on 20 May this\nyear.\nThe communiqu\u00e9 of the 33rd meeting of the\nPacific Islands Forum, held in Fiji last month, sets out\n23\n\nwide-ranging concerns that impact the livelihood and\nwelfare of the peoples of the Pacific. First and foremost\namong those concerns is the environment. The\ncontinued degradation of the Earth's environment\ncannot be ignored, in the light of the natural disasters\nthat are occurring in different parts of the world:\nflooding, earthquakes and droughts, to name but a few.\nThere is enough scientific evidence to show that the\nchanges in the Earth's environment and climate are\nhuman-induced. The World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment recently held in Johannesburg was an\nearnest attempt by us to remedy the situation.\nAll of us in the Pacific region were disappointed\nby the lack of meaningful targets in the Johannesburg\nPlan of Implementation. However, we believe that the\ncommitments for significant new resources and\npartnerships reached at the Summit will go a long way\nin helping to accelerate implementation of sustainable\ndevelopment.\nNauru is very pleased by the assured entry into\nforce of the Kyoto Protocol, thanks to the commitments\nmade by India, Canada, Russia and China to ratify that\ninstrument. But that is only the first step in what has to\nbe a universal campaign to address climate change. We\nwould therefore join the call for the United States and\nAustralia to see their way clear, in the not-too-distant\nfuture, to ratifying the Protocol.\nAnother issue of special importance to Nauru is\nthe health of our ocean. We are the custodians of the\nlargest ocean, rich in natural marine resources and\nminerals. The ocean also frames our cultures and is the\nsource of our future well-being. This is particularly\ntrue in the case of Nauru, which has a land area of only\n10 square miles and an ocean area of at least 120,000\nsquare miles. We use the ocean to provide desalinated\nwater, and earn a substantial amount of our income\nfrom fishing license fees. For the sake of our future,\nthe international users of our ocean space must work\nwith us to conserve the ocean's natural resources\nagainst unsustainable use; protect its biodiversity from\npollution, including through the shipment of toxic\nmaterials; and ensure that island countries benefit\nequitably from the trade in the ocean's natural\nresources, living or non-living.\nJust as the economies and the environment of\nPacific Islanders are vulnerable to external forces, so is\nthe security of our peoples and Governments. Our\nregion, the world's very first nuclear-free zone, has a\nlong history of supporting disarmament and the non-\nproliferation of nuclear weapons, born of the region's\nharsh experience with nuclear testing by colonial\npowers.\nI joined other Pacific Leaders last month in\nexpressing concern on the trans-shipment of nuclear\nwaste through our waters. My delegation welcomes the\ninitiative by Mongolia to institutionalize its territory as\na nuclear weapon-free zone and will support United\nNations action towards the realization of this goal.\nOn the domestic front, the potential fallout on our\neconomy of the OECD initiative on harmful tax\ncompetition is worrisome, to say the least. While my\nGovernment reaffirms the sovereign right of nations to\nestablish domestic tax regimes of their own design and\nchoosing, we have expressed our strong commitment to\ndeveloping a cooperative framework within which\ncountries can work together to address transparency,\ncapacity building and information exchange in relation\nto tax matters.\nWe remain of the view that the only place where\nmoney-laundering can be controlled effectively is at\nthe source. While Nauru has done all it can to date to\nensure that its legal and administrative system is\nsufficient to prevent such activities, we appear to\nremain the subject of adverse criticism from the\nFinancial Action Task Force on Money-Laundering\n(FATF). Nauru was disappointed not to have graduated\nout of the special, non-cooperating countries list. We\nwill, nonetheless, continue to work on satisfying the\nkey players in FATF on this issue.\nTwo most pressing issues facing my Government\nin a \u201cpost-phosphate\u201d future are energy and the supply\nof fresh water, as both have direct impacts on the\nstandard of living of the community. Nauru is\ndependent on the import of fossil fuel for its entire\nenergy requirement, including for the desalination of\nseawater to complement catchments of rainwater.\nBefore I conclude, Mr. President, I wish to\nreiterate Nauru's support for the reform of the United\nNations Security Council, and to support calls for this\nissue to continue to receive top priority. In terms of the\nUnited Nations itself, the ongoing administrative and\nbudgetary reforms by the Secretary-General are\nwelcome, but much more certainly needs to be done.\n24\n\nNauru is disappointed to see that contributions to\nthe Global Health Fund are only trickling in, contrary\nto our enthusiastic undertaking at the Special Session\nlast year. Consequently HIV/AIDS, malaria and\ntuberculosis continue unabated in their destruction of\ncommunities and continue to rob the manpower of\naffected nations. Nauru pledged to contribute $1 per\nhead of its population to the Fund, and I am pleased to\nannounce that this pledge has been honoured. I again\ncall on all Member States, rich and poor, to contribute.\nFinally, Mr. President, in the past two years the\nMillennium Summit and the Monterrey and\nJohannesburg Summits have illustrated the United\nNations' increasing role as a forum for building\nconsensus. Indeed, the last twelve months have been\ntrying times in our efforts to build consensus on\ndevelopment and to maintain international peace and\nsecurity. The challenge facing us in this area is not so\nmuch one of building consensus, because we all know\nwhat needs to be done, but rather one of\nimplementation. Achieving our lofty goals requires\naction and cooperation at all levels, from local to\nglobal. Mr. President, we look to you for leadership in\nthis decisive period and offer our steadfast support.\nFinally, 11 September 2001 seems to be a way of\nlife for some people. It is now etched into history and\nwhat a pity. The perpetrators cannot be proud of what\nhappened, and we should not allow them or encourage\nthem to proceed on their merry way. We must pursue\nthe alternatives we have, as they can be a great legacy\nfor our children. We the small nations have faith in the\nUnited Nations. We the small nations have hope in the\nUnited Nations. Let us embrace love in its entirety, for\nlove is a beautiful way of living. Thank you. God bless\nthe United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffYesterday we stood\nunited in remembrance of all those who lost their lives\na year ago. The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001\nwere an attack on us all. We, the States Members of the\nUnited Nations made this clear a year ago in this Hall.\nToday we stand united in unwavering determination in\nthe struggle against international terrorism and in the\nfight for the values, ideals and human rights that this\ngreat Organization is founded upon.\nTo succeed in our fight against terrorism, we must\nmeet three crucial priorities. First of all, as terrorism is\na global threat, our response must be global and\ncomprehensive. To succeed, the global coalition to\ncombat international terrorism must be maintained and\nfurther strengthened. We must continue our common\nefforts to prevent and eradicate terrorism, and to bring\nthe perpetrators to justice. We must deny the terrorists\naccess to weapons of mass destruction. We must\ncontinue to fight terrorism with all necessary means \npolitical, diplomatic, legal, financial and military. We\nmust ensure that we are fighting terrorism on our own\nterms, upholding the values, the rights and the\nfreedoms that the terrorists so despise.\nSecondly, we must strengthen our common efforts\nto maintain peace and security. A multilateral approach\nto global challenges requires relevant and effective\ninstitutions. Effective multilateralism calls for a strong\nUnited Nations and effective regional organizations.\nNorway stands fully behind efforts to strengthen the\nUnited Nations.\nThirdly, we must focus on root causes. I call on\nall Member States to fight extremism and fanaticism, to\nprotect and promote human rights, to resolve conflicts\nand to eradicate poverty. That is why to invest in\ndevelopment is to invest in peace.\nThe Millennium Declaration set out the precise\nobjectives to which we all are committed. We cannot\nafford to fail. Development must be built on a global\npartnership, in which all partners have clear\nresponsibilities.\nAt the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment, held in Johannesburg a week ago, we\nreaffirmed our commitment to the Rio principles and\nagreements, to the Millennium Goals, to Doha and to\nMonterrey. Together these agreements and declarations\nhave given us a platform for renewed efforts towards\nour common goal of sustainable development. The\nSummit in Johannesburg also demonstrated that\npromoting development and protecting the environment\nmust go hand in hand. Now it is up to us to make it all\nhappen. Making it happen requires that we commit to\nprecise and ambitious aims within the most pressing\nareas of concern. We tried to do so in Johannesburg,\nespecially in the areas of water, energy, health,\nagriculture and biodiversity.\nMaking it happen requires investment in people:\neducation, respect for human rights, the empowerment\nof women, and the empowerment of the poor. We need\nmore equitable sharing of wealth within and among\nnations.\nMaking it happen requires courageous and\nenlightened leadership. Good governance is\nindispensable for sustainable development.\nMaking it happen requires strong international\ninstitutions, both to monitor and to act on behalf of us\nall.\nLast but not least, making it happen requires\nfinancial resources. I urge the leaders of industrialized\ncountries to make speedy progress towards the 0.7 per\ncent target for official development assistance. Norway\nintends to increase development assistance to 1 per\ncent of its gross domestic product by 2005.\nThe cycle of violence in the Middle East must be\nbroken. We must all help to bring the conflict out of its\ndeadlock. Israel has a legitimate right to self-defence,\nbut a human disaster is unfolding before our eyes in the\nPalestinian areas. I urge the Palestinians to deal\neffectively with the terror. The terrorist attacks must\nend. I urge the Government of Israel to recommit itself\nto the political process while halting military\noperations and withdrawing its forces. Only a political\nprocess aiming at an independent Palestinian State and\nsecurity for Israel can lead to peace.\nAs the country holding the chairmanship of the\nAd Hoc Liaison Committee, Norway is working with\nother donors to help rebuild economic and social\ninfrastructure, while ensuring reforms in the\nPalestinian areas through our work in the established\nTask Force on Palestinian Reform.\nWe must continue our assistance in the years to\ncome in the troubled and war-torn country of\nAfghanistan. We condemn the recent attacks against\nthe lawfully appointed leaders of Afghanistan. The\nfight against the remaining groups of terrorists must\ncontinue. I pledge Norway's continued support to\n22\n\nAfghanistan. As the country holding the chairmanship\nof the Afghan Support Group, we have focused on the\nneed for both humanitarian assistance and long-term\nreconstruction aid. A sustained international presence\nis essential. Winter is approaching, and as many as 6\nmillion people are threatened with famine. We must\nalso ensure the protection of human rights, in particular\nthe rights of girls and women.\nIraq must address the unresolved disarmament\nissues in accordance with Security Council resolutions.\nThis means immediate and unconditional cooperation\nwith United Nations weapons inspectors. It is up to the\nIraqi leadership to allay international fears and to prove\nthat Iraq does not possess weapons of mass destruction.\nIt is up to Saddam Hussein to step out of isolation\nand bring Iraq back into the world community. Political\nand diplomatic efforts to achieve these goals have not\nyet been exhausted. Iraq must immediately comply\nwith United Nations demands. The responsibility for\nnon-compliance lies with Iraq alone. Further action by\nthe international community must be rooted in the\nUnited Nations.\nThe international community must stay fully\nengaged in resolving the conflicts that still prevail in\nmany parts of Africa. Parties to armed conflicts must\ncontinue to show political will and ensure that\ndiplomatic progress is translated into real results on the\nground, including in the Great Lakes region. Too many\nhave suffered for too long from armed conflict.\nIn the peace process between Ethiopia and\nEritrea, we have seen that progress is possible when the\nparties and the United Nations work closely together.\nThe search for peace and stability in the Horn of Africa\nmust also focus on resolving the conflicts in Somalia\nand Sudan.\nOver the years, Norway has been actively\ninvolved as a facilitator in the settlement process of a\nnumber of armed conflicts. In Sri Lanka, we have\nwitnessed significant progress over the past few\nmonths. A ceasefire agreement between the\nGovernment and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam\ncame into force at the end of February. The agreement\nhas laid the foundation for direct political negotiations,\nwhich will begin in Thailand next week.\nNorway is strongly committed to the protection\nand promotion of human rights. Human rights are the\nplatform for enabling people to choose and to develop\ntheir full potential. Respect for human rights and\nfundamental freedoms, the rule of law, openness and\ndemocracy are values and principles we share.\nHowever, common values and principles are of little\nvalue if they do not lead to concrete results to the\nbenefit of the individual.\nMany of the problems we are facing are directly\nrelated to the fact that the very human rights and values\nwe have all committed ourselves to are not being lived\nup to. This we see in Burma, and in other countries as\nwell. As leaders, we have a responsibility to protect our\ncitizens. We must focus on human security and\nprotection from violence. Civilians are targeted or used\nas instruments of intimidation and terror. Women and\nchildren are increasingly vulnerable. Relief workers\nand others who volunteer to help people in need are\nsubject to deliberate attacks and acts of violence. Our\ncommitment to human security means that we must\neffectively apply international humanitarian law.\nThe entry into force of the Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court is unprecedented. The\nCourt represents a decisive step towards the end of\nimpunity for the most serious crimes against humanity.\nWe need an independent, effective and credible Court.\nWe must work together to promote wide adherence to\nthe Rome Statute. The goal must be a universally\naccepted International Criminal Court, so that no\nperpetrator of mass killings or other crimes against\nhumanity and can feel safe.\nOur resolve to promote social development,\neconomic growth, democracy and human rights is the\nstrongest means we have at our disposal in the fight\nagainst poverty and injustice, as well as in the long-\nterm struggle to eradicate terrorism. We must use the\nfull spectrum of means and measures to secure\ndemocracy and opportunity for every person on this\nplanet. Only then can we hope to create a world in\nwhich there will be no more horrendous acts of\nviolence, extreme aggression and terrorism.\nThe multilateral system of cooperation can only\nbe as strong and assertive as Governments want it to\nbe. We have a common responsibility to make it strong.\nWe cannot think collectively and then act alone. Nor\ncan we think in isolation and expect to act effectively\ntogether. That is why we need a strong United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffWe have before us an\narray of issues that are as compelling and daunting as\never before. Many of these threaten to widen further\nthe divides that separate us and deepen more the\nwounds that pain us. They challenge ever so severely\nour resolve to live in peace and harmony. But we\nremain hopeful. Under the President's leadership and\nguidance, we are confident that our deliberations will\nbe purposeful and productive. Toward this, I assure the\nPresident of the full cooperation of my delegation.\nI take this opportunity to express our gratitude to\nHis Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo for his stewardship\nand contribution to the work of the fifty-sixth session.\nHis presidency, at a most challenging time in the\nhistory of the United Nations, has enhanced the esteem\nof the international community for him and the\nRepublic of Korea.\nMy delegation takes great pleasure in welcoming\nthe Swiss Confederation and the Democratic Republic\nof Timor-Leste as they take their rightful place in our\nfamily of nations. While we welcome the admission of\nTimor-Leste as a newly independent State, it is with a\nsense of deep satisfaction that we appreciate the\ndecision of the Swiss people. It is an affirmation of\ntheir faith in the relevance and indispensability of the\nUnited Nations. They, more than any other people,\nhave observed and studied with active participation the\nworkings of this world body. As a country for which\nthe United Nations will always be critically important,\nBhutan is indeed deeply heartened.\nThe loss of lives and untold suffering and\ndestruction wrought by the senseless acts of 11\nSeptember have united all of humanity against the evil\nof terrorism in all its manifestations. No clear\norientation towards international peace and\ndevelopment is possible without uprooting this disease\nthat has been allowed to afflict many of our societies.\nThe United Nations must continue to play a\ncentral and decisive role in directing our collective\nresolve and efforts to eradicate terrorism. While in our\nown countries we must each take all possible measures\nto rid ourselves of this menace, we know that it is\nthrough the multilateral framework that our national,\nregional and global efforts can be effectively and\nrightly coordinated. It is imperative that in our battle\nagainst terrorism, the norms and principles of this\nhallowed institution are not undermined. Our war on\nterrorism must continue to unite us.\nThe realization of a new economic order that is\ninclusive, equitable and sustainable remains the most\npressing challenge of the United Nations. The scourge\nof poverty and disease continue to afflict millions of\npeople around the world. My delegation is compelled\nto reiterate its concern over the decline in official\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) and the parallel\nemphasis on market efficiency and trade as an engine\nof growth.\nWe realize that trade underpins equal partnership\nand should represent the ultimate goal of economic\ndevelopment strategies. However, not all countries\n12\n\nhave the necessary capacity to take advantage of the\nglobal trading system. Without timely and adequate\nassistance to fill the resource gap to meet their basic\ndevelopment priorities, many of the developing\ncountries will continue to suffer from marginalization.\nClearly, there is a need to create a fair and\nequitable trading environment without prejudice to the\nflow of adequate Official Development Assistance. In\nparticular, the special needs and vulnerabilities of least\ndeveloped countries, landlocked developing countries\nand small island developing states must be\ncomprehensively addressed to enable them to\neffectively integrate into the global economic system.\nIn Africa, the international community must lend its\nfull support to extricate the continent from the malaise\nof underdevelopment and to prevent its further\nmarginalization. In this context, Bhutan welcomes the\nendorsement of the New Economic Partnership for\nAfrica's Development by the high-level plenary\nmeeting of the General Assembly and hopes that the\ninternational community will provide the necessary\nsupport to this programme. This is particularly\nsignificant for those countries emerging from conflict,\nin which the rehabilitation of social and economic\ninfrastructure is vital if peace is to be sustained.\nThere is no lack of vision and strategies to\novercome the socio-economic maladies that confront\nthe global community. The Millennium Declaration\nGoals provide clear targets and strategies to reduce\npoverty, achieve sustainable development and reverse\nthe devastating trend of HIV/AIDS, malaria and\ntuberculosis. What we need is greater political will.\nI wish to acknowledge the contributions of the\nUnited Nations and bilateral donors to the development\nof my country. We are grateful to our partners not only\nfor the substantial amount of assistance we have\nreceived over the years, but for the acceptance of our\ninsistence on being the master of our own destiny. Our\npartnership is characterized by a frank and open\npolitical dialogue of high intensity, while the\ncooperative arrangements at all levels are marked by a\nnotable degree of transparency.\nMy country continues to be guided by our goal of\npromoting gross national happiness' as opposed to\nsimply targeting the enhancement of our gross national\nproduct as the end of development. We believe that it is\nthe responsibility of the Government to create an\nenabling environment within which every citizen\nwould have a reasonable opportunity to find happiness.\nTowards this end, all our development strategies must\nsubscribe to strengthening of the four pillars of gross\nnational happiness, which are: first, the ensuring of\nequitable and sustainable socio-economic development;\nsecondly, conservation of our fragile mountain\necology; thirdly, promotion of basic human values and\nculture; and fourthly, the strengthening of good\ngovernance.\nIt is my belief that those are the pillars on which\nthe happiness of our human society can be firmly\nestablished. While I am fully aware that Bhutan is\ncertainly not unique in its pursuit of happiness, I\nexpress the hope that more among us will join in that\nsearch with a greater sense of seriousness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me to extend my best\nwishes to Mr. Kavan on the occasion of his election to\nthe office of President of the fifty-seventh session of\nthe General Assembly, as well as to congratulate his\npredecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, for presiding with\ncompetence over the proceedings of the last session. At\nthe same time, I take this opportunity to congratulate\nthe Swiss Confederation and East Timor on their new\nmembership in the United Nations. I would also like to\ngreet the return of the United States of America to the\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization, which we consider an important event\nthat will contribute positively to the future activity of\nthat Organization.\nDuring this year, Albania witnessed many\npositive developments in the political, institutional and\nsocio-economic areas. The new climate of dialogue that\nhas recently prevailed in Albanian politics is\nencouraging the reforms aimed at accelerating the\ncountry's integration into Euro-Atlantic structures. The\npolitical and social stability of the country is being\nconsolidated, thus creating the conditions for positive\ndevelopments in all fields. The continuous\nimprovements in democratic standards that characterize\nAlbanian society today are a result of the reforms\nundertaken to strengthen the rule of law and the\nbuilding of new democratic institutions.\nIn the process of implementing the commitments\nof the Millennium Summit Declaration, the Albanian\nGovernment is taking the necessary measures to\nintegrate the Millennium Development Goals into its\nnational development goals. The national strategy for\neconomic and social development, drafted recently by\nthe Albanian Government, with the support of the\nWorld Bank, has appropriately accommodated\ndevelopment indicators from various fields to the\nMillennium Development Goals. We have the political\nwill to continue on the long and difficult road of\nimplementing these objectives. We consider this to be\nan indispensable process for the country's sustainable\ndevelopment. Albania has already presented its report\non the implementation status of the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals.\nFor these stated purposes, the Albanian\nGovernment is undertaking an extensive campaign\ntargeting the State administration, civil society and the\nwhole of Albanian public opinion, with the purpose of\nmaking them aware of their role in implementing these\nobjectives. We highly appreciate the cooperation and\nsupport of the Secretariat, the Department of Economic\nand Social Affairs and the other specialized agencies of\nthe United Nations in implementing these objectives.\nThe Albanian Government has recently\nundertaken comprehensive action against the\nphenomena of illegal trafficking, smuggling, corruption\nand abuse of power. Being at the crossroads between\nEast and West, Albanian territory has been an attractive\nvenue for local and international criminal activities and\nhas been exploited as a bridge for the trafficking of\nhuman beings, drugs, arms and goods. The crises and\nconflicts that our region has been forced to experience\nhave contributed to that desirability. To combat this,\nthe Albanian Government has made concrete\ncommitments to end human and all other forms of\ntrafficking coming from, and going through, its\nterritory by severely punishing perpetrators to the full\nextent of the law, as well as by eliminating the causes\nthat create the conditions for such phenomena to take\nplace.\nThe political stability of the country has also\nwitnessed very positive developments. The recent\npresidential election, which has been conducted for the\nfirst time with the broad consensus of all parliamentary\nparties, is further contributing to that stability. The\noverall reforms we are undertaking have had as their\npoint of reference the standards of the most developed\nWestern countries. The ultimate aim is the integration\nof Albania into the Euro-Atlantic structures. Joining\nthe European Union has been a permanent major\nobjective of my country. The expected commencement\nthis fall of negotiations on the Stabilization and\nAssociation Agreement with the European Union will\nbe the best form of encouragement for the\ncomprehensive reforms being carried out in Albania.\nThe whole Albanian political spectrum, including the\nGovernment and the opposition, is committed to the\nachievement of this target.\nAlbania pays special attention to the Atlantic\ndimension of that integration. Our aspiration for full\nmembership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\n(NATO) is in line with NATO's strategic interest in\nstrengthening peace and stability in South-Eastern\nEurope. We believe that the wider the geographic\nspread of this organization, the more secure\ninternational peace and stability will be. We hope that\nthe ongoing fruitful partnership between Albania and\nNATO will be recognized and encouraged at the Prague\nsummit.\n8\n\nDuring the last few years, the region of South-\nEastern Europe has experienced a new era of positive\nchanges. The new liberal mentality is significantly\ntaking hold in the consciences of the citizens of our\nsocieties. We are confident that this part of Europe will\nsoon become part of the European common future. But,\nunfortunately, the traces of extreme nationalism and\nxenophobia that continue to exist remind us that we\nhave a long way to go before we are able to escape the\npast and establish genuine democracy in our region.\nAlbania is strongly convinced of the need to strengthen\nregional cooperation on the basis of the principles of\nfriendly and good-neighbourly relations, respect for\nsovereignty and territorial integrity and the protection\nof human rights and liberties.\nAlbania has made a valuable and internationally\nrecognized contribution towards the strengthening of\npeace and stability in the region. Strongly convinced\nthat Albania's internal stability is essential to the\nstability of other neighbourly countries in the region,\nand after having completed our tasks at home, we have\nsought to promote throughout the region the\nphilosophy of co-existence and tolerance, instead of\nthat of hatred and inter-ethnic and religious differences.\nWith its vision towards the future, Albania has made\nserious efforts towards the regional integration of the\ncountries of South-Eastern Europe on the basis of the\nEuropean Union model. We believe that this model of\nreconciliation and cooperation, which was designed\nand implemented after the Second World War, is the\nmodel that the Balkans should embrace and implement\nwith courage while leaving their bloody inter-ethnic\nconflicts behind.\nIn that context of cooperation and integration, the\nfree movement of people, goods and capital throughout\nour region should become a tangible reality for our\ncountries and their citizens. We have to be aware that\nwhat we have in common today, and what we will have\nin common in the future, is more important than the\nbitter heritage of past differences. This is the\nphilosophy of building on common values for a\ncommon future.\nAs stated two days ago in Kosovo by the External\nRelations Commissioner of the European Union, Chris\nPatten, Kosovo has undergone important changes that\ncould not have been imagined three years ago. The\nbuilding of self-governing democratic institutions in\nKosovo was a tremendous achievement by the people\nof Kosovo and the international organizations led by\nthe United Nations. The normal functioning of those\ninstitutions, with the participation and representation of\nall its citizens, will create the necessary conditions for\nthe further normalization of political, economic and\nsocial life in Kosovo. It is our conviction that the local\nelection to be held this October will be conducted in\nfull compliance with international standards and will\ncontribute further to the consolidation of institutions\nand the democratization and Europianization of\nKosovo.\nThe Albanian Government hails the cooperation\nbetween the United Nations Interim Administration\nMission in Kosovo and Kosovo's elected institutions.\nWe are convinced that those relations will be further\nstrengthened in the future to the benefit of all the\ncitizens of Kosovo.\nAlbania supports Security Council resolution\n1244 (1999), as well as the efforts and commitment of\nthe Special Representative of the Secretary-General in\nKosovo, Mr. Michael Steiner.\nAlbania views relations with Kosovo in the\nbroader perspective of regional stability, cooperation\nand integration. Albania encourages and supports a\nstable and sustainable Kosovo as a constructive and\ncomplementary element of the region's stability and\nintegration. This means that Kosovo should be open in\nits relations, not only with Albania but also with Serbia\nand all other countries of the region. Albania sees the\nfuture of Kosovo from the perspective of regional and\nEuropean integration processes. This future requires\ndemocratic standards, such as the consolidation of\ndemocratic institutions, the strengthening of the rule of\nlaw, the return of Serbs and the normal functioning of a\nmulti-ethnic society there.\nThe future status of Kosovo must simultaneously\nsatisfy a number of elements and principles, such as the\nright of all its citizens to express themselves on these\nand other matters regardless of their ethnic\nbackground; the will of the international community;\nand the need to guarantee the stability of Kosovo and\nthe region itself. The status of Kosovo depends on its\nstability.\nIn accordance with its long-term vision of\nregional cooperation and European integration, Albania\nhas committed itself to promoting further its relations\nwith the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The recent\nupgrading of those diplomatic relations to the\nambassadorial level and Albania's initiation of a\n9\n\nnumber of bilateral agreements are concrete examples\nof that commitment.\nWe welcome the recent democratic elections in\nthe Presheva valley, and we strongly believe that those\nelections will contribute to the strengthening of\nstability in that region. The integration of Albanians\ninto all levels of the central and local administrations\nand the protection and respect of their rights will no\ndoubt bring positive developments to that area, to\nSerbia and to the region at large.\nThe Albanian Government is interested in\ndeveloping cooperative and good-neighbourly relations\nwith the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. We\nwelcome the democratic elections held recently in that\ncountry. We look forward to the early creation of a\nstable, long-term government, having as its major\nobjective the full implementation of the Ohrid\nAgreement, the essential condition for the maintenance\nof peace, stability and democracy and for the\ncontinuation of the reforms in our neighbouring\nrepublic.\nThe European integration processes have\nincreased the awareness of Albania and that of the\nother South-eastern European countries of the role and\nimportance of regional organizations and initiatives.\nThey are efficient instruments that bring countries\ntogether, not only in the form of political cooperation,\nbut also by intertwining their interests in many fields,\nsuch as trade, transport, culture and education.\nFighting organized crime is another dimension of\nsuch cooperation. In March, Albania successfully\nconcluded its chairmanship of the South-East European\nCooperation Process, while in April it assumed the\npresidency of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation.\nWe are confident that, during the meeting of the\nForeign Ministers of member States of the Black Sea\nEconomic Cooperation process, to be held in Tirana in\nOctober, the participating countries will reaffirm their\nreadiness to strengthen their political and economic\ncooperation and to translate it into programmes and\nprojects.\nOne year after the terrorist attacks of 11\nSeptember 2001, our hearts still feel the pain of the\nloss of innocent lives. The endangering of peace,\nfreedom and democratic values \u2014 a challenge that\nfaces all United Nations member countries \u2014 calls for\nthe creation of a unified front. Terrorism has become a\ncommon enemy from which none of us is immune.\nNevertheless, our determination to fight that enemy is\nresolute, and it gives us an opportunity to build a more\nsecure and more peaceful world.\nAlbania was among the first countries to align\nthemselves with the international coalition against\nterrorism. This year, in compliance with Security\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001), Albania has taken\nlegislative, executive and administrative actions to\nfight against that phenomenon. At present, Albania has\na complete legal framework that provides for the\ncontrol, investigation and punishment of potential\nterrorist acts and of persons who are linked to or\nsupport such acts. Albania has become a party to the 12\nUnited Nations Conventions related to the fight against\nterrorism. The Albanian Government has also taken\naction to set up and strengthen specific State structures\nto prevent and fight against terrorism. Those structures\nare also responsible for and capable of offering full\ncooperation on an international level.\nAlbania has praised and supported the activity of\nthe United Nations peacekeeping Mission in\nAfghanistan and is currently contributing troops to that\nMission.\nWe have followed with deep concern the\ndevelopments in the Middle East and the threat that\nSaddam Hussein's regime poses to security, peace and\nglobal solidarity against State-backed terrorism. The\nAlbanian Government reaffirms its position, which\ndemands Iraq's full compliance with the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions. Any hesitation or\nindecisiveness with regard to implementing United\nNations decisions and resolutions concerning Iraq\nwould be a challenge to the international community\nand could have grave consequences for peace and\nglobal security. We are convinced that, as President\nBush said a few days ago in this Hall, we cannot stand\nby and do nothing while dangers gather. We must stand\nup for our security and for the permanent rights and\nhopes of mankind.\nTogether with the entire international community,\nthe Albanian Government is following with concern\nthe escalation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Our\nposition is that a solution to that conflict can be found\nthat will bring about a sustainable and lasting peace.\nAlbania welcomes the steps taken by the international\ncommunity to bring peace and stability to the Middle\nEast and expresses its confidence that both parties to\n10\n\nthe conflict will join the international community in its\nefforts to find a permanent solution.\nOur region faces many challenges that its\ncountries must confront together. The United Nations\nhas an important role to play in uniting the efforts of\nindividual Members to create the necessary synergies\nto deal with those challenges. Armed conflicts,\nterrorism and international organized crime, poverty,\nthe violation of human rights, contagious diseases,\nnatural calamities and environmental pollution are\nproblems that require not only the commitment of all\nour countries, but also coordinated and efficient joint\naction by the United Nations based on the principles of\nthe Charter. The United Nations must strengthen its\nrole in preventing and resolving conflicts as well as in\nensuring peace and stability. In that respect, its\ncooperation with regional security organizations should\ncontinue, based on the best examples of the past. In\npromoting peace and development, the United Nations\nshould use more efficiently the available financial\nresources, aiming at their better management but also\nat tailoring its projects and programmes to the specific\nneeds of beneficiary countries.\nThe Albanian Government welcomes and\nsupports the efforts of the Secretary-General to reform\nthe Organization and hence to enhance its efficiency.\nI should like to take this opportunity to thank the\nUnited Nations Department of Economic and Social\nAffairs, the United Nations Development Programme\nand the other specialized agencies of the Organization\nfor their efforts to assist the Albanian Government in\nimplementing its development programmes and\nprojects.\nI would like to emphasize that this is a special\nyear for the United Nations. Many important events\nhave taken place in connection with such issues as the\nrights of children, the ageing of populations, nutrition,\nthe fight against poverty and environmental protection.\nAlbania has contributed to those events. On this\noccasion, on behalf of the Albanian Government, I\nwould like to pay tribute to the outcomes and\ninitiatives of the Summit on Sustainable Development,\nheld at Johannesburg a few days ago. We are convinced\nthat the commitments undertaken by our countries in\nconnection with those initiatives will soon be embodied\nin joint efforts aimed at creating a better world for\neveryone.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is an honour for me\nto address the General Assembly on behalf of the\ndelegation of the Kingdom of Swaziland. I bring with\nme the warm greetings and best wishes of His Majesty\nKing Mswati III, Her Majesty the Indlovukazi, the\nGovernment and the whole Swazi nation to all\nmembers of the United Nations family.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland joined the rest of the\nworld in sadness to commemorate the first anniversary\nof the monstrous acts that took place in September last\nyear. Our hearts once again reached out to all those\nwho suffered on that fateful day here in New York and\nelsewhere in the United States, and to all those whose\nlives have been affected by subsequent events around\nthe world.\nIn the aftermath of 11 September, the world is\nunderstandably preoccupied with the question of\nsecurity and the war against terror. The Kingdom of\nSwaziland reiterates its strong commitment to do all in\nits power to support the global alliance against\nterrorism, and is determined to ensure that no aspect of\nterrorism, including its financing and organization,\nmay be permitted to take root within our borders.\nThe progress made in some areas of Africa is part\nof a general trend of optimism that is spreading among\nall the countries on our continent. We cannot deny that\nthere remain many serious challenges to address, both\nin terms of conflict situations and in terms of overall\ndevelopment. We have placed our trust in the African\nUnion to be the vehicle for this shift away from the\nunderdevelopment of the past, and the Kingdom of\nSwaziland looks forward to working with its fellow\nmembers to make the new body one that will truly\naddress the challenges and make a real difference in the\nlives of our peoples.\nOf crucial importance to the success of the\nAfrican Union is the role of the developed world in\nliving up to its commitments to the continent and to all\nin the developing world.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland continues to develop\npeacefully and quietly, according to the aspirations and\nexpectations of its people. Our relationship with the\ninternational community remains founded on the\nprinciples of peaceful coexistence with all, on the\nresolution of all disputes through peaceful dialogue,\nand on mutual respect and due regard for the\nsovereignty of independent nations. We value our\nmembership in the United Nations and other\ninternational, regional and subregional organizations.\nOur cooperation and friendship with other countries of\nthe world give us an important instrument through\nwhich we can address our national economic, social\nand humanitarian concerns. Of particular importance\nare our access to international markets for our goods\nand the attraction of foreign direct investment: both are\ncentral to our efforts to improve our economy and to\nprovide jobs for our people.\nPoverty alleviation remains our number-one\npriority. Sixty-six per cent of our people are living\nbelow the internationally recognized poverty line, and\nyet our classification as a lower-middle-income\ncountry denies us many of the funds and resources that\nare available to those in other categories. We will be\nworking with the United Nations to ensure that that\nsituation is corrected.\nIn the meantime, we are focusing all our efforts\nand available resources on programmes that meet the\nchallenge of poverty in a sustainable and equitable\nmanner. Our national development strategy, which is\nthe result of direct consultation with the people\nthemselves, provides us with a blueprint for\nGovernment action and conforms precisely to the\nprinciples of Agenda 21.\n10\n\nDespite all our best efforts and our limited\nsuccess in many areas, we are restricted in our capacity\nto meet our objectives, not only by our lack of access\nto development funds, but also by a multitude of\nproblems that are affecting us simultaneously and that\nwe cannot overcome on our own. As is the case with all\ndeveloping countries, we are particularly at risk in\ntimes of global economic difficulties and are especially\nvulnerable to disease and to the effects of changing\nweather patterns.\nOvershadowing all our development challenges,\nhowever, is the threat posed by multiple health risks,\nincluding malaria and tuberculosis, but especially\nHIV/AIDS. AIDS continues to claim the lives of huge\nnumbers of Swazis, and no family in our Kingdom has\nescaped the deadly touch of that disease. No sector of\ndevelopment is immune from the consequences of the\nvery high and increasing HIV infection rates among\nour people, with enormous strain placed on our\nfinancial and human resources in the battle to cope.\nWe are trying our best in the light of our limited\nresources. A national emergency response committee\non HIV/AIDS has been established to provide the focus\nfor our efforts. We are attacking the enemy on various\nfronts, with priority placed on prevention, care,\ncounselling and treatment. Perhaps the greatest tragedy\nis the effect on children who have lost their parents to\nthe disease. We are battling to provide those\nunfortunate orphans with the means to continue normal\nlives, especially with regard to food, clothing and\nschooling.\nWe are ready to embrace approved strategies of\nmedical care, including those that reduce mother-to-\nchild transmission of the virus, and the prescription of\nanti-retrovirals for those who need them. However, the\nsimple fact is that we cannot afford those costly drugs,\nand we must rely on the sympathy and support of\nothers. That is why the Kingdom was encouraged by\nthe expressions of commitment at last year's AIDS\nSummit and by the creation of the Global Fund to Fight\nHIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. With our hopes\nhigh for support from the Fund, it came as a grave\ndisappointment to our people that our application to the\nFund earlier this year had been rejected and that the\ncriteria for selection of projects had become unclear.\nWe earnestly hope that our second application will\nmeet with approval and that international support from\nthat resource, and from those of all who pledged their\nsolemn commitments, may at last be forthcoming to\nhelp us in this national disaster.\nIn the meantime, we look to our own resources to\nfight the battle. One answer lies in the rediscovery of\npractices that are within our own traditions and culture.\nWe have resurrected the rites of chastity and respect for\nself that served our people well for many generations\nin the past, and these are finding increasing acceptance\nin our nation, especially among the younger generation.\nAs we announced last year, His Majesty has also\nreached out to the international entertainment\ncommunity for support, and we have been\noverwhelmed by the positive and heart-warming\nresponse. Next month will see the release of an album\nof music from international artists, entitled \u201cSongs for\nLife\u201d, whose proceeds will go entirely to HIV/AIDS\nprogrammes in southern Africa. We look forward with\ngreat confidence to the success of the album, with its\naims of promoting global awareness of the crisis in\nmany countries and of raising funds on a scale that will\nhelp those of us most affected to cope with its dreadful\nconsequences.\nAt precisely this moment of maximum\ndisadvantage, the Kingdom of Swaziland and others in\nthe southern African region have been hit hard by food\nshortages that are affecting 21 per cent of our people,\nlargely as a result of lack of rain. We have been warned\nthat the situation will deteriorate further next season\nwith the likely advent of the El Ni\u00f1o effect.\nFurthermore, the food security situation has been\nexacerbated by other problems, such as the lack of\nclean drinking water in rural areas and the prevalence\nof HIV/AIDS-related illnesses and deaths, which leave\nfamilies with severely diminished resources to meet\ntheir basic needs.\nUsing our scarce resources, we are making every\neffort to help our people, and we have made one of our\ntop priorities the construction of dams throughout the\nrural areas, where the crisis is the most serious. The\nKingdom of Swaziland is grateful to the Secretary-\nGeneral and to the United Nations agencies for their\nefforts to address those problems through the launching\nof a United Nations Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal\nin response to the humanitarian crisis in southern\nAfrica. We are grateful for the response to the Appeal,\nand we hope for increased support as the famine\ntightens its grip on us.\n\n\nWe appreciate the direct involvement of the\nSpecial Envoy of the Secretary-General on the\nhumanitarian crisis in our region, Mr. James Morris,\nand we look forward to working with him, and with all\nour international friends and partners, who have\nalready been so generous with emergency food aid, to\nmake it through this latest crisis for the Swazi nation.\nThe review of the Kingdom's constitution\ncontinues, and the drafting stage is almost complete.\nThe next phase will be the people's review of the draft\ndocument to ensure that their wishes have been met.\nThat will be the final stage before the document is\nformally adopted. We trust that the international\ncommunity will respect the fact that this final\ndocument, the product of extensive consultation with\nthe whole nation, will be the true expression of the\nwishes of the people themselves, and will serve the\nKingdom of Swaziland well for many generations to\ncome. We are grateful to all who have supported us in\nthis nation-building exercise.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland would like to extend\na warm welcome to the United Nations newest\nMember, Switzerland, and soon-to-be Member East\nTimor. There now remains just one group of people\nthat is denied the opportunity to participate in the\nactivities of the United Nations and its associated\nagencies. I refer here to the 23 million inhabitants of\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan, a sovereign State and\na constructive member of the international community.\nThese 23 million people have shown time and\nagain that they are willing and able to contribute to the\ninternational community. At this critical time in the\nhistory of the world, which is faced with the challenges\nof instability, under-development and economic\ndifficulties, we cannot afford to exclude from our joint\nefforts the resources and skills of the Republic of\nChina on Taiwan. As a democratic, prosperous and\npeace-loving nation, Taiwan has displayed her\nreadiness to assist the development challenges of her\nfriends and partners, and has intervened in\nhumanitarian crises across the globe. Taiwan needs the\nUnited Nations, and the United Nations needs Taiwan.\nWe therefore appeal once more to our fellow Members\nto recognize the right of the 23 million people of the\nRepublic of China on Taiwan to representation in the\nUnited Nations system, and to take the appropriate\nmeasures to achieve this objective.\nWe are living in dangerous times. Global tension\nand the possibility of wide-scale conflict threaten all\nthe hopes for a century of peace, stability and\nsustainable development that were expressed at our\nMillennium Summit just two short years ago.\nOur strength as an Organization depends on\nconsultation and consensus among all Member States\nin matters that affect the whole world. The summits\nand special sessions that we all attend at great cost are\nvaluable only insofar as we carry through the\nresolutions we arrive at and the commitments we make.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland believes that the\nfundamental principles on which the United Nations\nwas founded still present the best and only chance for\nhumankind to live and work in harmony with one\nanother.\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland here reaffirms her\nfull commitment to the founding Charter of our\nOrganization and offers her fullest support to all its\nactivities that have as their aim to make this world of\nours safer, more equal and healthier for all its people.\nWe look forward to working with the United Nations\nand her associated agencies in the coming year, to help\nus to meet the development challenges of our people.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe Madagascar delegation, which I have the honour\nof leading for the first time at this session of the\nGeneral Assembly, is delighted to congratulate Mr. Jan\nKavan on his well-deserved election to the presidency\nof this session, and we wish him every success.\nTo his predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, we\nexpress our most sincere appreciation for having led\nthe fifty-sixth session to a successful conclusion\nthrough dedication and skilful leadership.\nThe dedication of our Secretary-General,\nMr. Kofi Annan, to the attainment of the objectives of\nthe United Nations deserves our full appreciation and\ngratitude.\nThe admission of the Swiss Confederation as a\nnew Member of the United Nations is for Madagascar a\nsource of profound satisfaction. This friendly country\nis a living example of a peaceful and multicultural\nsociety based on values of democracy and freedom.\nHere today, in the framework of the\ncommemoration of the tragic events of 11 September\n2001, we wish to express our solidarity with the people\nand the Government of the United States. We reiterate\nour condemnation of such terrorist acts, whose\nconsequences are incalculable. A global phenomenon\nwithout borders, terrorism is considered to be the most\ndangerous enemy of the new millennium. It can be\neradicated only through harmonious international\ncooperation.\nIn this regard, we wish to pay tribute here to the\nefforts of the United Nations, acting through the\nCounter-Terrorism Committee created by the Security\nCouncil, for the implementation of Council resolution\n1373 (2001), and we commend all other regional\ninitiatives adopted to combat this plague. To fight\nterrorism, countries such as ours will need special\ntechnical assistance in order to implement this\nresolution of the United Nations, as well as other\ninternational treaties.\nThe persistence of areas of tension and conflict\naround the world, especially the Middle East, demands\nthe reinvigoration of the United Nations to make it\nmore effective in responding to the needs of the\ninternational community, particularly in maintaining\ninternational peace and security. To pursue this critical\nobjective, we must now more than ever strengthen our\nefforts to make the Security Council more democratic,\nmore representative and more transparent.\nThere is no doubt that the United Nations\nprovides us with the ideal framework for creating\nconditions that encourage States and peoples to choose\npeace over war. In this regard, Madagascar wishes to\ncongratulate Timor-Leste on its independence after a\nvaliant and heroic struggle by the people of that\n13\n\ncountry and successful efforts by the United Nations to\nre-establish peace there.\nFurthermore, Madagascar encourages the\nmediation efforts undertaken by the United Nations for\nthe settlement of conflicts in a number of countries\nthroughout Africa. In this context, I wish to reiterate\nthe profound gratitude of the Malagasy people for the\nrole the United Nations agreed to play in resolving the\npost-election dispute that threatened Madagascar. This\ncrisis is now over and Madagascar is now experiencing\na new era full of hope.\nWe are convinced that sustainable development\nrequires the consolidation of the rule of law and the\nestablishment of good governance. Towards this end,\nthe new Government is taking all appropriate measures\nfor the sound and rational management of public\nfinances and of international assistance. Madagascar\nhas given the fight against corruption the very highest\npriority. We have also taken the initiative to insure that\nan effective policy is developed and applied in order to\ntackle this evil on all fronts. Madagascar supports\nGeneral Assembly resolution 55/61, through which our\nGeneral Assembly decided to create an ad hoc\ncommittee entrusted with negotiating a future legal\ninstrument against corruption. Our country is awaiting\nthe conclusion of such an instrument in the near future,\nin order to fill the gaps in its own legal system. We\nlook forward with considerable interest to the high-\nlevel Conference in Mexico in 2003 for signing a\nconvention against corruption.\nThe rapid and sustainable development of\nMadagascar is the major and fundamental objective of\nthe present Government, in order to extract the country\nfrom the scourge of poverty, a source of instability that\nerodes democratic values. In this context, Madagascar\nis committed to a pro-active policy aimed at recovery\nfor rapid and sustainable growth of its economy, in\nwhich the private sector will be the driving force.\nAs we see it, the key to development is\npartnership between the public sector and the private\nsector, in which the Government works together with\nprivate companies and non-governmental organizations\nsolely for the benefit of the people. We invite private\nbusinesses to invest in Madagascar. The returns on\nthose investments will be beneficial both to them and\nto the Malagasy people.\nAs an essential component of development and of\npeace, education is our priority of priorities. Malagasy\nchildren will live fully in the world of the twenty-first\ncentury, which is characterized by advanced\ntechnology of information and communications. Thus,\nMadagascar welcomes the adoption of Assembly\nresolution 56/258 calling for a World Summit on the\nInformation Society to be held in 2003 and in 2005.\nThe world community will then have a unique\nopportunity to discuss information and develop the\nopportunities offered by digital technologies, in\nparticular in Africa and in the least developed\ncountries.\nThe Republic of Madagascar is ready to do\neverything in its power to put the country back on the\npath of development. This will be done with the\nsupport of the international community in the\nframework of mutually advantageous cooperation.\nI take this opportunity to express our gratitude\nand our appreciation to all of Madagascar's\ndevelopment partners, bilateral, regional and multi-\nlateral, for their valuable contribution to the re-\nlaunching of economic activity in our country.\nFaced with multiple challenges in our era, a time\ndominated by poverty and underdevelopment,\ninternational cooperation is no longer a choice; it is an\nabsolute necessity for the survival of humanity. Those\nfactors that diminish us as human beings: poverty,\nHIV/AIDS, famine and illiteracy, cannot be eliminated\nwithout a true spirit of solidarity, guaranteeing a better\nfuture for all people. Let us not forget that the\npreamble of our Charter announces a new humanity\nwith peoples and human beings living in dignity and\nsecurity. Towards that end, they must have access to\nfundamental human rights, the right to health care, the\nright to education and to culture, and the right to a\ndecent income. Our mission, to reduce poverty\neverywhere in the world, has become today more\nimportant and more urgent than ever before.\nThe slowdown in economic activity, on a global\nscale, following the attacks of 11 September 2001, has\nworsened impoverishment and plunged millions of\nindividuals into a state of dire need. In this grim\ncontext, globalization could play a vital role in the\nfight against poverty, as long as the countries of the\nnorth and the south are offered the same opportunities\nof development.\nIn order for globalization to truly benefit\nhumankind, it must take into consideration the interests\n14\n\nof all countries the world over, in an international\neconomy of sharing.\nGlobal interdependence and better international\neconomic cooperation must be entirely accepted, if we\nare to obtain the objectives of the Millennium\nDeclaration. A collective awareness to develop a real\npartnership for development is indispensable in order\nto make a reality of that objective. In this spirit,\nMadagascar welcomes the consensus reached at the\nInternational Conference On Financing For\nDevelopment, which was held in Monterrey.\nIn the same context, Madagascar urges the\ninternational community to give firm and concrete\nsupport to the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment (NEPAD), and to give that support both\nbilaterally and multilaterally. With the objective of\ngiving an important role to the private sector in\ndevelopment, Madagascar fully and without reserve\nsupports the principles and objectives underlying\nNEPAD. In the coming months, I intend to make\nMadagascar one of the leading countries of NEPAD,\nbecause I am sincerely committed to good governance,\nthe development of infrastructures and energy,\neducation, new technologies, access to the markets of\ndeveloped countries and the protection of the\nenvironment.\nThe alarming conclusions of a United Nations\nEnvironment Programme report entitled Africa\nEnvironment Outlook', as well as the recent weather-\nrelated disasters in Central Europe and Asia, require\nthe international community to develop a new code of\nethics for the conservation and effective protection of\nthe environment. Our Government will make the\nprotection of our precious environment one of our main\npriorities. Furthermore, Madagascar hopes that the\nSummit on Sustainable Development held in\nJohannesburg a few days ago will give new impetus to\nour collective determination to offer all countries an\nopportunity to develop in a way that benefits their\ninhabitants, their environment and our shared heritage,\nthe Earth.\nBy some standards, Madagascar is a poor country.\nHowever, it is rich in unique natural resources and in\neducated human resources. Above all, its population is\nattached to democracy, family values and belief in\nGod.\nWe would like today to express our desire to\ncooperate with the United Nations as a partner for the\nreconstruction of Madagascar. By working in\npartnership, we will ensure for our country a future of\nhope. The entire world will come to know us by our\nstrengths, not our weaknesses.\nWorking together with the United Nations family,\nMadagascar is ready to make its own contribution to\nbuilding a global village in which all countries receive\nequal treatment and have equal opportunities for full\ndevelopment - an indispensable condition for the\nestablishment of lasting peace.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me begin by\nwelcoming the United Nations new Member,\nSwitzerland who has always been devoted to the cause\nof the United Nations and has now finally decided to\njoin us. I look forward to welcoming East Timor as the\nnewest Member of the Organization in the very near\nfuture. I would also like to pass on my congratulations\nto the newly elected President of the General\nAssembly.\nToday I would like to address three subjects of\nmajor concern for our globalizing world: the struggle\nagainst terrorism, human trafficking, and sustainable\ndevelopment.\nA year ago today, the whole world was still\nrecoiling from the horrendous terrorist attacks in the\nUnited States. Immediately after the terror attacks,\nmost States, including Estonia, and almost all\ninternational organizations expressed their solidarity\nwith the United States.\n12\n\nWe also associated ourselves with the North\nAtlantic Council's statement of 12 September 2001,\nwhich invoked article 5 of the Washington Treaty, as\nwell as with relevant European Union statements and\nundertakings.\nEstonia is actively participating in the\ninternational coalition to combat terrorism. We have\ncontributed a search and rescue team to Operation\nEnduring Freedom under United States leadership. Our\nhighly trained explosives detection dog team is\npresently serving in Afghanistan alongside the forces\nof the other countries, which are helping to restore\norder in that war-torn land.\nWe appreciate the noteworthy role of the United\nNations and its Security Council in the universal\ncampaign against terrorism. We fully recognize the\nimportance of preventive measures and further\nstandard-setting in this field. To date, not a single\ncrime that could be classified as terrorism has been\ncommitted in Estonia. However, let me assure you that\nEstonia will continue to make all efforts necessary to\nfulfil its role in this ongoing quest for comprehensive\ninternational security.\nIndeed, I can announce for the record that Estonia\nhas ratified all the relevant United Nations conventions\nand has promptly presented reports to the appropriate\nparties about the implementation of the various\nSecurity Council resolutions.\nWe are confident that truly joint efforts, which\nmake use of the input of all States, will eventually\nenable the international community to make\nremarkable progress in the global struggle against\nterrorism. In this regard, cooperation to counter the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction is of\nparticular significance, since sooner or later, terrorists\nmight actually gain access to these ghastly tools of\ndoom.\nToday, the United Nations faces the challenge of\nupholding its authority. For the sake of our future, and\nthe prestige and relevancy of the United Nations, it is\nessential that the United Nations does not shy away\nfrom reacting effectively and decisively when\nconfronted with real and formidable dangers. Full and\nunconditional implementation of Security Council\nresolutions is obligatory for all Members, just as is the\neffective enforcement of these resolutions.\nTherefore, we value highly the decisiveness of\nthe international community to implement the\nresolutions dealing with Iraq. Estonia supports the\nSecretary-General's further efforts to obtain Iraq's\ncompliance with the Security Council resolutions. The\nreturn of the United Nations weapons inspectors to Iraq\nis just a beginning. Further acts will have to follow.\n\nThe possible results of international\nindecisiveness and appeasement are well illustrated by\nthe history of the League of Nations, which\ndisappeared from the international arena, just as did\nsome of its member States, including my homeland,\nEstonia. The result was an international conflagration\nthat left a large part of the civilized world in ruins, the\nvery ruins upon which the United Nations Organization\nwas founded. This taught us all a very essential\nlesson \u2014 inaction can often be much more disastrous\nthan action.\nAnother important issue which deserves to be\ntouched upon here is human trafficking, in particular\ntrafficking in women. The Estonian Government\nrecently acceded to the three Protocols additional to the\nUnited Nations Convention against Transnational\nOrganized Crime, including the Protocol to Prevent,\nSuppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially\nWomen and Children. In June 2001, at the Women and\nDemocracy Conference in Lithuania, the Nordic and\nBaltic Ministers for Gender Equality decided to launch\na joint Nordic-Baltic information campaign against\ntrafficking in women.\nThe aim of the campaign, which will continue at\nleast until the beginning of 2003, is to turn the general\npublic's attention to the problems of prostitution and\ntrafficking in people and to initiate public discussion\nabout the problems surrounding the issue of trafficking\nin women. The joint campaign is being carried out\nsimultaneously in the eight Nordic and Baltic\ncountries, with all relevant institutions concentrating,\nthroughout this year, on the matter of how best to\ncombat this problem. We hope that we will soon have\nsome concrete proposals for drafting amendments to\nappropriate national legislation.\nThe problem of trafficking in women, however, is\npart of a broader series of issues relating to women,\nincluding their position in society, their participation in\nthe decision-making process and so on. In order to\ndiscuss all of these topics in depth and to highlight\n13\n\nwomen's role in democratic societies, Estonia will\nhost, in February 2003, a major international\nconference on women and democracy. I sincerely hope\nthat that conference will help to further the cause of\nwomen's rights.\nAnother crucial issue on the global agenda, and\nthe last topic that I wish to speak about, is development\ncooperation and sustainable development. Having\nparticipated in the Monterrey discussions, and in the\nwake of the Johannesburg Conference, I would like to\nemphasize that the most important factor for sustained\nand sustainable development is a clear national goal\nand a road map for achieving it. Estonia is in the\nprocess of drafting a special sustainable development\nstrategy, a process involving the cooperation of both\ncivil society and the private sector.\nEstonia acknowledges the problem of\nenvironmental deterioration, and we have taken action\nto tackle it. Estonia has ratified the Kyoto Protocol \u2014\namong many other international and regional\nagreements concerning the environment \u2014 and we will\ndo our best to fully implement the decisions made in\nJohannesburg.\nSince the successful implementation of recent\ninternational decisions depends largely on the\nconcerted action of the various parties, communication\nand access to information are becoming key issues.\nBridging the digital divide between the haves and the\nhave-nots is essential if we want all countries to benefit\nequally from globalization. Thanks to our rapid rate of\nprogress, Estonia has been able to support development\nin various other countries.\nThe creation of an e-governance academy in\nEstonia \u2014 a cooperative effort involving the Estonian\nGovernment, the United Nations Development\nProgramme and the Open Society Institute \u2014 is a\nsignificant step towards bridging the digital gap with\nthe countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia. The\nacademy will also be open to other interested regions.\nThe academy will draw on the experiences gained in\nvarious environments, thereby providing broad\nknowledge that will enable participants to choose or\ncreate the best solution for their particular situation.\nAmong other things, this project demonstrates the\nsynergy that can be created from cooperation between\nGovernments, international organizations and non-\ngovernmental organizations.\nToday I have spoken about some of the issues on\nthe global agenda, all of which have been discussed at\nlength at recent international meetings and\nconferences. Those discussions provided us with useful\nsignposts, agreements and decisions. Now it is time to\nimplement them.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMr. President,\nI wish, at the outset, to congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan on\nhis election to the presidency of the fifty-seventh\nsession of the United Nations General Assembly. I\nwould like also to express my high appreciation to his\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo of the\nRepublic of Korea for having efficiently presided over\nthe deliberations of the fifty-sixth session. Viet Nam\njoins others in welcoming the Democratic Republic of\nTimor-Leste and the Confederation of Switzerland to\nour family of nations.\nWe come to this session with the remembrance of\nthe tragic incident of 11 September, when thousands of\ninnocent lives were lost in the towering inferno caused\nby terrorists. Our world has changed a lot since that\nday, as Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in his\nstatement before this body last week, to the effect that\nthe terrorist attacks of 11 September were not an\nisolated event, that they were an extreme example of a\nglobal scourge, one which required a broad, sustained\nand global response.\nBy adopting Security Council resolution 1373\n(2001) and General Assembly resolution 56/1, by\nenacting and carrying out various measures in different\nfields, at national as well as regional levels, the\ncommunity of world countries has sent out a very clear\nand resolute message: we condemn in the most\ncategorical terms terrorism under whatever forms\nagainst innocent people, and we will take action under\nthe Charter of the United Nations, because that must be\nthe way for our fight to be sustained.\nFighting terrorism does not simply mean bringing\nto justice the perpetrators and conspirators, but also\ntackling the poverty, injustice, subjugation and illegal\noccupation that underlie it. That is to say, while\nfighting against terrorism remains high on our agenda,\nother issues, notably the resolution of regional conflicts\nand the implementation of important development\ngoals set out in the Millennium Declaration, such as\nalleviating poverty, narrowing the gap between the rich\nand the poor and development gaps within and among\nnations, fighting against HIV/AIDS, drugs, organized\ntransnational crime, protecting the environment \u2014 all\nthese should not be downgraded or become any less\nurgent.\nOver the past year, besides efforts against\nterrorism, the United Nations took the lead in\norganizing a series of important international\nconferences, most notably the Monterrey International\nConference on Financing for Development, the Special\nSession of the General Assembly on Children, the\nWorld Summit on Food Security and the Johannesburg\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development, where\nconcrete measures were adopted in the interests of each\nand every nation. The United Nations also continued its\nimportant work on conflict prevention, peace-building\nin various parts of the world, including its preparations\nfor East Timor's independence, and conflict resolution\nin Africa and elsewhere. Mention should be made of its\nefforts relating to the Peace Agreement between the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda. The\nUnited Nations and the Secretary-General should be\ncommended for these significant endeavours.\nEven with those achievements, however, the\nUnited Nations is expected to do more. The\nOrganization must enhance its efforts to help resolve\nprotracted conflicts, especially those in the Middle\nEast, by peaceful means and free from intervention and\nimposition. In this vein, we reiterate our full support\nfor the legitimate struggle of the Palestinian people to\nexercise their inalienable rights to self-determination\nand to live in an independent and sovereign State.\nWe welcome the dialogue between the\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea and the\nRepublic of Korea and the resumption of talks between\nthe former and the United States, and we sincerely\nhope that they will lead to fruitful conclusions. We\nagain join other speakers in voicing our concern over\nthe issue of Iraq, and in welcoming all efforts to defuse\nthe tension. The acceptance by Iraq of the return of\nUnited Nations weapons inspectors without conditions\ngives us some hope that a military attack will be\navoided.\nIn a world of interdependence, we consider it\neven more important to uphold the principle of respect\nfor the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political\nindependence of States. In this regard, an early end\nmust be put to the blockades and embargoes that for\ndecades have been causing immeasurable suffering to\nthe peoples of Cuba, Iraq, Libya and elsewhere.\nAs arms races re-escalate in many parts of the\nworld, the Conference on Disarmament, for four\nconsecutive years, has not been able to start its\nsubstantive work; we must find a way to break the\ndeadlock.\n20\n\nEffective measures to limit and mitigate the\nnegative impact of globalization on developing\ncountries need to be formulated and implemented to\nensure equal development opportunities for all nations.\nInternational commitments to raising and maintaining\nofficial development assistance at the level of 0.7 per\ncent of gross domestic product, to building an open,\nequitable multilateral trading system, to removing\nprotectionism with a view to facilitating access of\ngoods from developing countries into developed\nmarkets, to debt relief, and to implementing numerous\nprinciples to protect the global environment including\nthe principle of common but differentiated\nresponsibilities, and so on, must be strengthened and\nput into action. To accomplish these goals, the United\nNations and its affiliated agencies and organizations,\nespecially the financial institutions need to strengthen\nthemselves through the ongoing reform process.\nViet Nam continues to hold the view that this\nprocess should primarily focus on enhancing the role of\nthe General Assembly and on making the Security\nCouncil more democratic, representative, transparent\nand accountable through the expansion of its\nmembership in both the non-permanent and the\npermanent categories. In that connection, we wish to\nreaffirm our support for those candidates, such as\nIndia, Japan and Germany, that have the capability to\nmake major contributions to the work of that important\nbody.\nIn South-East Asia, the countries of the\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) are\ndetermined to strengthen their unity and cooperation in\norder to respond to the challenges arising within and\noutside the region. The implementation of the Hanoi\nPlan of Action, the Initiative for ASEAN Integration\nand the Hanoi Declaration on narrowing the\ndevelopment gap for closer ASEAN integration has\nachieved initial encouraging results.\nASEAN has continued to further deepen its\nrelationship with its dialogue partners as well as other\ninternational institutions and organizations, with a view\nto contributing further to peace, stability and\ndevelopment. Apart from their strong commitment and\nenormous efforts devoted to the fight against terrorism,\nincluding the recent signing of the ASEAN-US Joint\nDeclaration for Cooperation to Combat International\nTerrorism, the ASEAN countries are working closely\nwith China for the early adoption of a declaration on\nthe conduct of parties in the South China Sea. This is\nanother positive development towards building a code\nof conduct in the South China Sea, as agreed by\nASEAN leaders at the Sixth ASEAN Summit, held in\nHanoi in December 1998, thereby contributing to the\npromotion of confidence-building and the resolution of\nall disputes by peaceful means.\nConsistent with its foreign policy of\nindependence, sovereignty, openness,\nmultilateralization and the diversification of its\nexternal relations as well as its desire to be a friend and\nreliable partner of all countries striving for\nindependence, peace and cooperation, Viet Nam has\ncontinued to develop and strengthen its friendships and\nmultifaceted cooperation with countries in and outside\nthe region, and with international organizations.\nViet Nam is expediting all necessary procedures to join\nthe World Trade Organization soon.\nThe free and democratic general elections held in\nMay 2002 and the successful conclusion of the first\nsession of the new National Assembly, with highly\nqualified representatives elected to important State,\nNational Assembly and Government positions for the\n2002-2007 term, constitute important events in the\npolitical life of our nation and create a firm foundation\nfor us to continue the renewal process aimed at\nbuilding Viet Nam into a strong country with a\nprosperous people and a just, democratic and civilized\nsociety. In striving for those goals, we hope to continue\nto enjoy the support and cooperation of all countries\nand organizations. For its part, Vietnam pledges to do\nits utmost to contribute to the work of the United\nNations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is an\nhonour for me to address the General Assembly at its\nfifty-seventh session. Let me first of all, Sir, discharge\na pleasant duty on behalf of my delegation and on my\nown account, and extend to you my warmest\ncongratulations on your election to the presidency of\nthe Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. You may rest\nassured of the support and cooperation of the\ndelegation of Burundi towards the success of your\ndifficult and important mission. I also pay tribute to\nyour predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo,\nfor the able manner in which he led the work of the\nfifty-sixth session.\nFurthermore, I would like to take this opportunity\nto express our gratitude to the United Nations, and to\npay tribute to its Secretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan,\nfor his support to the people of Burundi.\nNor can I fail to thank the Security Council for its\ntireless efforts to find a lasting solution to the crisis in\nBurundi. Through its two visits to Burundi, the latest\non 5 and 6 May 2002, the Security Council has shown\nits solidarity with the people of Burundi in its quest for\npeace.\nDuring my address, I shall inform the Assembly\nof the political situation in Burundi, and of how far we\nhave come in the peace process; I will then go on to\nspeak of the challenges we still face and will conclude\nmy statement with some comments on international\nissues.\nFollowing the establishment of transitional\ninstitutions beginning 1 November 2001, the political\nclimate in Burundi has greatly improved. The political\nforces that had taken part in the Arusha negotiations\nand signed the Peace Agreement now form the\ninstitutions of the Republic: the Government, the\nNational Assembly and the transitional Senate.\nAdvocating dialogue in an armed conflict is not\nalways an easy task, but a sense of responsibility gives\nus no alternative. We are pleased to recall from this\nrostrum that we have chosen the option of peace\nthrough dialogue and the procrastinations of others\ninvolved in no way shake our conviction.\nSince we are on the right path, we request the\nSecretary-General, the Security Council, the African\nUnion and the countries of our subregion to maintain\ntheir support for our quest for peace by assisting the\nmediation activities  led by Nelson Mandela, assisted\nby Presidents El Hadj Omar Bongo and Benjamin\nMkapa and Vice-President Jacob Zuma  in order to\npersuade the protagonists to sign a ceasefire agreement\nwithout further delay. Indeed, certain provisions of the\nArusha Agreement are not being applied precisely\nbecause of the ongoing violence. That is why the\nnegotiation and signing of a ceasefire is a crucial stage\nin hastening and ensuring the success of the many\nreforms to be undertaken.\nThe task ahead is enormous, but it can be\naccomplished. The smooth functioning of institutions is\na guarantee of success, while daily experience\ndemonstrates the serious commitment of the political\npartners and is the basis of our optimism.\nWhile it is true that there are reasons for hope, it\nis equally true that the challenges to the peace process\nare genuine and could compromise our path to peace if\nthey are not satisfactorily met in the short term. The\nviolence which the rebels continue to force on the\nBurundian people is a major challenge not only to us,\nbut to the United Nations, whose primary mission is to\nmaintain peace throughout the world.\nWe take this solemn opportunity to reiterate our\nrequest to the entire international community to compel\nthe Burundian rebels to renounce violence. If\ndiplomacy does not succeed, all other means must be\nused in order to prevent this rebellion from taking\nhostage a peace process being led today by a\nGovernment formed on the basis of negotiations and\nwhich now enjoys international legitimacy. Peace will\ncome to the Great Lakes region when every country\nthere is living in peace. To that end, the effort must be\nboth individual and collective. That is why my country\nis prepared to continue making its contribution to\ncreating a better climate with all neighbouring\ncountries.\nThe second major challenge is the reconstruction\neffort. After nine years of crisis, the Burundian\neconomy has been sorely tried. The population has\nbecome further impoverished, all economic parameters\nhave been destabilized, and our external indebtedness\nprevents us from resorting, as we have done in the past,\nto the international financial marketplace. Here again,\n7\n\nwe ask our traditional partners to give substantial\nsupport to our peace efforts. Promises have been made\nthat we hope will be kept in the near future. Indeed, the\nrepatriation of refugees, the resettlement of displaced\npersons and the rebuilding of damaged infrastructure\nwill require substantial financial resources.\nAs members of the human community,\nBurundians are also following the concerns of the\nworld, which, sadly, are many and to which we are\nconstantly seeking solutions. To cite but a few, Burundi\nwelcomes the creation of the Global Fund to Fight\nAIDS and, like other countries that have been deeply\naffected by the pandemic, has requested that access to\naffordable medicine be improved until such time as\nresearchers are able to develop a vaccine against this\nscourge, which threatens all humankind, especially in\nAfrica. In the same vein, my delegation supports the\nidea of creating a world fund to fight poverty and also\nwelcomes the proposal to establish a world fund for the\nenvironment.\nEven closer to home, our peoples await the\nconcrete results of the recent World Summit on\nSustainable Development in Johannesburg, at which\nthe community of nations reaffirmed the need to work\ntogether towards equitable and viable development for\ncurrent and future generations. We also welcome the\nestablishment of the Office of the High Representative\nfor the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked\nDeveloping Countries and Small Island Developing\nStates. This testifies to the unequivocal commitment of\nthe United Nations to enhancing and focusing efforts\non behalf of the most vulnerable groups of countries.\nOn the African continent, the New Partnership for\nAfrica's Development is a major source of hope and, as\nsuch, deserves the support of the international financial\ninstitutions and of the community of donors.\nAlong with the poverty that is affecting millions\nof human beings, another fearful danger is that of\nterrorism. A year after the terrorist attacks of 11\nSeptember 2001 in New York, Washington, D.C., and\nPennsylvania, the world remains in a state of shock and\nis seeking ways to stem the scourge of international\nterrorism. To that end, Burundi is committed to\nimplementing the provisions of Security Council\nresolution 1373 (2001), which provides the blueprint\nfor a collective fight against terrorism.\nThe great challenges of poverty, environmental\ndegradation, international terrorism, armed conflict and\nincurable disease require all nations, rich and poor, to\nrecognize international solidarity as the necessary\nmeans of survival for us all. The United Nations is\ntherefore called on to meet this challenge, especially by\ncarrying out the necessary reform of its organs  the\nSecurity Council, the General Assembly and the\nEconomic and Social Council  in order to make them\nmore complementary and effective in the interest of all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish at the outset to pay tribute to the\nremarkable work of the Secretary-General, who,\nthrough his outstanding personal qualities and sense of\ndialogue, gives our Organization unparalleled\ninfluence. I congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan on his election\nas President of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nseventh session. I also congratulate Switzerland on its\nadmission to our Organization, and Timor-Leste on its\nforthcoming admission.\nA year ago, to our stunned horror, New York and\nWashington were struck in unprecedented attacks.\nFrom now on no one now can disregard the dark side\nof the world: international terrorism that combines\narchaism with technology, and shifting underground\n28\n\ncriminal networks with a growing risk of the\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nThese formidable opponents insinuate themselves\ninto the heart of the world's complexity. They play on\nfrustrations and resentment, hatred and fears. They foil\nour plans; they know how to find weak spots and turn\nour weapons against us. No, the world is definitely not\nsuffering from an excess of power. To the contrary, it is\nsuddenly discovering its extreme vulnerability.\nFaced with these threats, the temptation to forge\nblindly ahead could emerge. That would be a serious\nmistake. Force cannot be the sole response to these\nelusive adversaries that are constantly changing.\nThe example of Afghanistan shows this.\nMobilizing the international community enabled us to\noverthrow a retrograde totalitarian regime that\nharboured and supported the Al Qaeda network and\ndealt a harsh blow to terrorist infrastructures. That was\nnecessary, but it is not enough. We must now rebuild;\nwe must help the Afghan people, maintain our efforts\nover the long term, and continue our work to bring\nabout stability and democracy, but also to dismantle the\ndrug economy and the trafficking it fuels.\nThe fact that force alone is often futile is one of\nthe characteristics of our age. We live in a world that is\ninterdependent, where cause and effect may be distant,\nindirect and unpredictable. Let us take care that our\ninterventions do not give rise to new frustrations,\nproduce new imbalances or spark fires that we cannot\nput out.\nThe case of Iraq is typical of this new situation. It\nis a country that has defied the authority of the Security\nCouncil and flouted international law for years. It is a\nregime that poses a grave threat to security, particularly\nthe security of the peoples of its region, because of the\nrisk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Its\nconduct is the direct cause of the great suffering\nendured by its people.\nIs the international community concerned? Of\ncourse it is. Can it continue to tolerate this situation?\nDefinitely not. Should it act? Obviously: the status quo\ncannot go on. France's determination to obtain\ncompliance with the law is absolute.\nWe must act, but we must do so effectively. We\nmust act, but without risking results opposite to those\nwe seek. We must take care not to exacerbate a\nsituation that is already very disturbing. We must act,\nbut there are many traps. Intervention that is politically\nor legally ill-defined or poorly mounted would not\ngarner the broad support necessary; it might galvanize\npublic opinion in the region against it, and the regime\nin Baghdad, which is isolated now, could benefit;\nlastly, it might exacerbate tension in the Middle East\nand beyond at a time when we should, on the contrary,\nredouble our efforts to return to the path of dialogue\nand peace.\nHow are these traps to be avoided? How are we to\nsucceed? There is only one way, and it is demanding. It\nis the path of responsibility  collective responsibility.\nThe world now is one of interdependence. Its stability\nconcerns us all. All of us must contribute to it.\nThe necessary measures must be adopted by the\ninternational community after in-depth and transparent\nconsideration. Any temptation to engage in unilateral\npreventive action would be dangerous. We must take\ncare to avoid any suspicion of bias or injustice. This is\nthe only way to ensure that any action to enforce law\nand restore security does not add to insecurity. That is\nthe best guarantee of effectiveness.\nThat is why, in the case of Iraq, France advocates\na d\u00c8marche made completely legitimate by collective\ndeliberation. It requires two successive steps. First, we\nmust together reaffirm the need for United Nations\ninspectors to return and demand that Iraq comply at\nlast with its obligations under the Security Council\ndecisions taken since 1991, and do so according to a\ndefinite timetable. That is the objective of the\ninternational community. It is also in Iraq's interest. If\nBaghdad persists in its refusal to allow the inspectors\nto return unconditionally, then there must be\nconsequences. The Security Council should then decide\non the measures to be taken without excluding any\noption. Responsibilities would be clarified. The world\nmust be able to act. But it must also be coherent and\neffective, in a sustained way. That is today the real\nchallenge to our values, and to our democracies.\nI recently travelled to the Middle East, the\nBalkans and Afghanistan. I realized the strength of the\naspirations and hopes for peace. But I also saw how the\nefforts and energies of various parties need to be united\nand centred on a collective ambition.\nNo Power can today assume sole responsibility\nfor world equilibrium. The world aspires to be\nstructured around poles of stability and progress. In\naddition to the United States, the European Union is\n29\n\nnaturally destined to form one such pole, along with\nRussia, China, Japan and India, among others. In future\neach actor must make its contribution to the effort. It is\na common project that we must build.\nThat is the ambition that inspires the European\nUnion, and France's action within it. The Union affirms\nits role on the world stage in the service of peace and\nprosperity. It is acquiring the appropriate diplomatic\nand defence instruments. With a view to major\nenlargement, the Union is also committed to genuinely\nre-making its design. That is the purpose of the\nConvention on the Future of Europe, guided by the\nprinciples of democracy and effectiveness for a future\nEurope. In that way, the Union will contribute to the\nstability of the continent and beyond. Finally, the\nEuropean model reconciles in a unique way the\nrequirements of social cohesion and economic\nperformance to further a common plan, while\nrespecting the diversity of all. For all those reasons, I\nam convinced that Europe's voice offers elements for\naddressing the major challenges of our time.\nToday, power in all its aspects must be shared. It\nis essential to listen to diverse approaches and points of\nview. A dialogue among cultures is essential. Only this\nwill enable us to understand the main issues today by\ntaking into account the history and aspirations of every\npeople and every country. Only this can prevent us\nfrom having too narrow a conception of the world\nbased on ignorance and on fear of the other. Only this\ncan guide us in putting humankind back at the centre of\nour concerns and at the heart of our action and our\nshared commitment.\nSharing means responding to the requirement of\nsolidarity. Extreme poverty, famine, epidemics and\nfinancial crises are factors contributing to disorder and\nfomenting instability. Terrorism feeds on these things.\nGenerosity must be the corollary of power. It is our\npolitical and moral duty. It is also in our own interest.\nAccordingly, France has pledged to augment its\ndevelopment assistance, which will increase by 50 per\ncent over the next five years.\nOwing to its geographic proximity and historical\nand cultural ties, my country has a deep friendship for\nAfrica. It feels a special responsibility. That continent,\nmore than others, needs the solidarity of the\ninternational community in the difficult trials it is\nexperiencing: the too-numerous conflicts that persist;\nthe return of the spectre of famine; the economic\ndifficulties; and the tragedy of AIDS, which today\nstrikes nearly 30 million Africans.\nYet Africa is rich in potential, rich in the\nenthusiasm of its young people and in the energy of its\ncivil society, and rich in memory, in tradition and in a\ntreasury of wisdom from which we all have much to\nlearn. Important efforts are under way today to advance\nhuman rights, democracy, the fight against corruption,\nand favourable economic and social policies for strong\nand balanced growth. The establishment of the New\nPartnership for Africa's Development attests to the\ncontinent's willingness to take charge of its\ndevelopment, in the context of a renewed partnership\nwith the industrialized countries. Let us recognize and\nsupport those efforts.\nIn particular, we must help Africa to move\nforward on the path of conflict resolution in Sierra\nLeone, Liberia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and the Sudan. Those\ntragedies concern us all, because today there are no\nmore localized crises. Instability spreads. The\ninternational community must mobilize.\nIn the Great Lakes region, the agreements signed\nat Lusaka, Pretoria and Luanda must be implemented.\nThey must lead to the withdrawal of all foreign troops\npresent in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to\nthe disarmament of foreign armed groups, to\nreconciliation and to a return to peace.\nWith regard to Western Sahara, it is good that the\nSecurity Council, in its most recent resolution,\nresolution 1429 (2002), gave Mr. James Baker the time\nto work to bring the parties closer together. That time\nmust be used to make progress.\nWe must stay engaged in the Balkans, where the\nprogress made this year must be consolidated in\nKosovo, in the former Yugoslav Republic of\nMacedonia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Linking\nthe Balkans to Europe through the rule of law and\ndemocracy is, more than ever before, our common\naspiration.\nIn the Middle East, we must emerge from the\nimpasse and restore hope. The situation will worsen as\nlong as the parties remain prisoners to the logic of\nviolence. There is urgency to act. The Palestinian\nAuthority must use all available means to prevent and\ncurb terrorist actions. With a view to the creation of an\nindependent, viable and democratic Palestinian State,\n30\n\nbased on the 1967 borders, it must pursue its reforms,\nparticularly in the institutional context.\nFor its part, the State of Israel, while it\nlegitimately wishes to defend itself against terrorism,\nmust do so with respect for international law. The\nsecurity imperative cannot by itself take the place of\npolicy. Settlement-building must cease, and the Israeli\narmed forces must withdraw from the occupied\nterritories, as demanded by the Security Council.\nMeasures must be taken quickly to improve the now\nalarming humanitarian and social situation of the\nPalestinian people.\nOn the basis of Security Council resolutions 242\n(1967), 338 (1973) and 1397 (2002) and the principle\nof land for peace  which all the Arab countries,\nmeeting in Beirut, agreed to recognize at the initiative\nof Saudi Arabia  the political process must be\nrelaunched with the aid of the `quartet'. We support\nthe convening of an international conference at an early\ndate. The objective must be a just, comprehensive and\nlasting peace; a peace based on the coexistence of two\nStates within secure and recognized borders,\nguaranteeing security for the Israelis and offering the\nPalestinians a normal life with dignity; a peace based\non a comprehensive settlement of the regional conflict\nbetween Israel and its neighbours.\nThe attention that we pay to regional crises must\nnot distract us from the responsibility that we must\nassume in the face of global challenges. The United\nNations is playing its full role in the fight against\nterrorism. Let us do likewise in the other great\nstruggles of our time.\nLet us fight tirelessly against the proliferation of\nweapons of mass destruction and their means of\ndelivery. The President of the French Republic has\nproposed that the Security Council meet at the highest\nlevel in 2003, during the General Assembly, with a\ndouble mandate: to review non-proliferation policy and\nto give it a new impetus.\nLet us mobilize all actors for sustainable\ndevelopment in a renewed partnership, in conformity\nwith the commitments made at Doha, Monterrey and\nJohannesburg. The time has come to strengthen\nconcrete cooperation to permit access by all to basic\nresources such as water and energy, to basic social\nservices such as education and health, and to food\nsecurity. Let us also call for the ratification and full\nimplementation of the Kyoto Protocol on climate\nchange.\nLet us establish true global governance of\nsustainable development and give it the necessary\ncoherence. France proposes the creation of an\neconomic and social security council and of a world\nenvironmental organization to give all countries \nespecially those of the South  the possibility of\nmaking their voices heard on those issues.\nFinally, let us fully exercise our responsibility to\ndefend and promote human rights. These are universal.\nProgress, often fragile, must be encouraged. Violations,\noften so numerous, must be punished.\nLet us strengthen the authority and the\nuniversality of the International Criminal Court to\nenable it to ensure that the most serious crimes at the\ninternational level do not go unpunished. This new tool\nis essential to build a more just and democratic world\nwhere the principle of responsibility is fully respected.\nThrough ambitious conventions, let us provide\nbetter protection, as we did for children, for the\ndisabled and for the victims of forced disappearance\nand torture. Let us fight against corruption. Let us\ncommit ourselves to the negotiation of a universal\nconvention against human cloning for reproductive\npurposes, as proposed by France and Germany.\nYes, the principle of collective responsibility is at\nthe heart of the international system. It is at the heart of\nUnited Nations action. In order to play its full role, the\nOrganization must pursue its reforms. In particular, we\nmust increase the representativity of the Security\nCouncil by enlarging both categories of membership.\nFrance supports the aspirations of Germany, Japan and\nIndia in particular.\nThe United Nations is the keystone of the world\norder. The generous and strong ideas that presided over\nits birth, just after a world conflict that pushed the\nlimits of barbarism to the unspeakable, retain all their\ncurrency. The contemporary world is complex,\nconfusing and unpredictable. It is urgent that we forge\namong nations a new alliance, a community of destiny.\nThat is our future; that is our chance. Through our\nactions, let us respond to the expectations of the\nworld's peoples."

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the\noutset, I should like to tell you, Sir, how pleased my\ndelegation is to see you presiding over the work of the\nfifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. To your\npredecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, I should also like to\nexpress my sincere and warm congratulations on the\ncompetence, devotion and authority with which he\nguided the work of the fifty-sixth session.\nI should also like to express again to Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, Secretary-General of the Organization, the\nwarm congratulations and profound gratitude of the\nGovernment of Mali for the effectiveness and wisdom\nhe has shown in managing the concerns of the\ninternational community in a particularly difficult\ncontext. I take this opportunity to reiterate to the\nSecretary-General the thanks of His Excellency Mr.\nAmadou Toumani Tour\u00e9, President of the Republic of\nMali, for the confidence that the Secretary-General has\nplaced in him in seeking solutions to certain conflicts\nthat are shaking Africa. He expresses Mali \u2018s readiness\nto continue to work for the preservation of international\npeace and security, particularly in Africa.\nMali wishes to welcome to the Organization\nSwitzerland and Timor-Leste, whose admission\nstrengthens the universal character of the United\nNations.\nThe fifty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly is opening in an international context\nmarked by the persistence of areas of tension, of\ndevelopment inequalities and of growing poverty\namong the peoples in developing countries, of the sad\nconsequences of globalization, of natural disasters and\nof the extremely difficult consequences of the terrorist\nattacks of 11 September 2001, whose first anniversary\nthe international community has just commemorated.\nAt the time, Mali vigorously condemned those attacks,\nwhich nothing can justify. Since then, it has\nparticipated in the great international campaign of the\nfight against terrorism. In so doing, it has ratified all\ninternational legal instruments related to the fight\nagainst terrorism. Likewise, important means and\nmechanisms have been put in place so that Mali \u2018s\nnational territory cannot be used for the preparation or\nperpetration of terrorist acts.\nIn order to meet the terrorist threat, it is important\nthat the international community strengthen\ncooperation among its members. Furthermore, Mali\ncalls for integrated and sustained global action, in\nwhich the United Nations should play the premier role.\nIt reiterates the appeal of Africa, of the Non-Aligned\nMovement and of the Organization of the Islamic\n2\n\nConference for the holding of an international\nconference under the auspices of the United Nations\naimed at swiftly concluding a universally accepted\nlegal instrument on international terrorism.\nIn Mali, the year 2002 was devoted to the\nholding, for the third time, of pluralistic, democratic\nand peaceful elections, at the outcome of which His\nExcellency Mr. Amadou Toumani Tour\u00e9 assumed the\ncountry \u2018s highest post. Those elections are sufficient\nproof that Mali \u2018s democratic institutions have taken\nroot, and they support the democratic culture of the\nMalian people.\nHere, I must express, on behalf of the people and\nthe Government of Mali, my heartfelt thanks to all our\npartners for their contribution to the organization, the\nholding and  the success of those elections. Mali is\ndeeply attached to the consolidation of the rule of law,\nto the preservation of peace and security and to the\nimprovement of the living conditions of populations. In\nthat regard, our conviction remains that we must\ndeepen, promote and respect those values.\nFor Mali, republican and democratic institutions\nmust be renewed only through democratic institutional\nmechanisms that have been established in advance. The\nstrengthening of good governance, the consolidation of\nthe democratic process, food security, the improvement\nof the educational and health systems, the organization\nand effective functioning of justice, actions to promote\nchildren and women, and the fight against poverty and\ncorruption are, inter alia, the challenges to which the\nnew Government of Mali is committed to face.\nLikewise, as part of its policy of economic and\nsocial development, Mali is working, with the help of\nits development partners, to implement macroeconomic\nreforms designed to re-launch the process of growth\nand development.\nMali is resolutely determined to guarantee\nindividual security in all its dimensions. That why my\ncountry is a full-fledged member of the Human\nSecurity Network. It fully agrees that there is a need to\nharmonize efforts with regard to the destruction of anti-\npersonnel landmines and the fight against the illicit\ntrade in and the proliferation of small arms and light\nweapons, with a view to adopting a United Nations\nprogramme of action to reduce the human suffering\ncaused by those scourges.\nStability, peace and security are prerequisites for\nany process of true development in Africa. Despite the\nsignificant progress made in resolving certain African\nconflicts, our continent continues to be faced with a\nnumber of ongoing problems, including debt, the\ncontinuing fall in the price of raw materials, the\ndemocratic deficit, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, malaria\nand difficulties related to humanitarian assistance.\nThose issues constitute a serious impediment to\ndevelopment efforts in Africa.\nMali welcomes the fact that the long fratricidal\nconflict in Angola has come to an end and pays a well-\ndeserved tribute to the people and the leaders of\nAngola for the courage that they have shown and the\nefforts that they are continuing to make to consolidate\npeace and bring about national reconciliation.\nI should like to take this opportunity to pay\ntribute to the United Nations for its valuable\ncontribution to the search for a resolution of the\nAngolan conflict.\nI should also like to pay tribute to my compatriot,\nthe late Alioune Blondin Beye, a talented diplomat who\nwas the Special Representative of the\nSecretary-General for Angola from 1994 until the time\nof his death in June 1998. Alioune Blondin Beye made\nthe supreme sacrifice on behalf of peace in Angola.\nThe recent signing of a peace agreement between\nthe main parties to the conflict in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo is a further reason for hope.\nThese glimmers of hope for conflict management on\nthe continent will require intense support from the\ninternational community, which must provide further\nsupport for Africa's efforts through in the form of\nresources and mechanisms that are capable of\nproviding security and promoting development,\nstability and peace.\nThe launching of the African Union, which has\nreplaced the Organization of African Unity, certainly\nrepresents the most decisive historic and political event\non the African continent this year. The African Union\nwill enable the continent to plan for its future more\nclearly, take responsibility for its own development,\nprevent and manage conflict and promote partnership\nand international cooperation that is better adapted to\nthe expectations of the population.\nThe recent adoption at Durban of the Protocol\nRelating to the Establishment of the Peace and Security\n3\n\nCouncil of the African Union, a standing decision-\nmaking body for conflict management and resolution in\nAfrica, represents an important step forward in the\nsetting up of a collective rapid-reaction security system\ndesigned to facilitate an appropriate and effective\nregional response in dealing with conflict situations\nand crises in Africa. It is also the appropriate tool to\nbolster the efforts of the Security Council in fulfilling\nits main responsibility for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security, in particularly in\nAfrica. Mali has already begun to take the necessary\nmeasures to ratify that important instrument.\nThe New Partnership for Africa's Development\n(NEPAD) also deserves ongoing support from the\ninternational community. Indeed, NEPAD offers the\ninternational community a historic opportunity to\nestablish a credible partnership with Africa \u2014 a\npartnership founded on shared responsibility.\nMali remains deeply concerned about the\ndramatic developments of the situation in the Middle\nEast. The responsibility of the international community\nin dealing with that situation remains a commitment\naimed at a global, just and lasting peace in the Middle\nEast \u2014 a peace founded on Security Council\nresolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the\nprinciple of land for peace.\nThe creation of a Palestinian State \u2014 the central\nissue of the Middle East question \u2014 side by side with\nIsrael, within safe and internationally recognized\nborders, in accordance with Security Council resolution\n1397 (2002), would be the best guarantee of a just and\nlasting peace in the region.\nOn a different subject, Mali accords priority to\ninternational cooperation on the basis of international\nlaw in the search for a lasting solution to conflicts that\nare of concern to the international community. This\nprinciple should apply to the handling of the Iraqi\nissue.\nThe creation of the International Criminal Court,\nwhose Statute was adopted in Rome, will not only\nmake it possible to bring to justice those who commit\nthe most serious crimes that infringe on the dignity of\nthe human person, but also will provide an instrument\nof deterrence that contributes to the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. In this respect, my\ncountry would like to reaffirm its full support for the\nfight against impunity and for full respect for human\ndignity.\nMy country would like to appeal to those\ncountries that have still not acceded to the Statute of\nthe International Criminal Court to do so in order to\nstrengthen the legitimacy of that institution.\nWe are faced with a number of economic\nproblems that are impeding the full growth of several\nof our States. The globalization of the economy has\ncontributed greatly to a serious imbalance whose chief\nvictims are the developing countries. It has led in\nparticular to the impoverishment of a large number of\npeople, to environmental degradation and to large-scale\nmigration.\nExternal debt is a heavy burden for poor\ncountries. The money used to service the debt has to\ncome from the meagre resources of those countries,\nwhich seriously handicaps any attempt to re-launch\ngrowth and development. Despite the measures agreed\nto aimed at alleviating the debt burden for poor\ncountries and allowing access to the markets of the\ncountries of the North, the inequalities persist and\npoverty continues to worsen.\nNew measures designed to establish closer links\nbetween debt- and poverty-reduction activities should\ncontinue. More flexible mechanisms need to be set up,\nhowever, in order to mobilize and utilize the resources\ngenerated by the application of the Heavily Indebted\nPoor Countries Debt Initiative. In this respect, it is\nhighly desirable for the developed countries and the\ninternational financial institutions to envisage measures\ncapable of enabling the developing countries to move\nfurther towards sustainable development and to benefit\nfrom globalization. Fulfilling the development\nobjectives set forth in the Millennium Declaration\nwould bring that about.\nMali warmly welcomes United Nations initiatives\nin support of the least developed countries, as\nexemplified by the Brussels Programme of Action. My\ncountry welcomes the holding in March 2002 at\nMonterrey of the International Conference on\nFinancing for Development and, more recently, the\nJohannesburg World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment.\nThe conclusions and recommendations that came\nout of those two important meetings reflect the\ndetermination of the international community to\ncommit itself in a resolute manner to achieving the\nobjectives contained in the Millennium Declaration.\n4\n\nThe Government of Mali also encourages\ninstitutions and Governments throughout the world to\nimplement the relevant provisions contained in the\nMadrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, since it\nis true that development policies and strategies\nintended to reduce poverty must necessarily take\naccount of the problems of ageing.\nThe democratization and restructuring of the\nmain organs of the United Nations desired by the\noverwhelming majority of Member States, would\ngreatly contribute to peace and security in the world. In\nparticular, the democratization of the Security Council,\nwhose structure no longer reflects the realities of\ntoday's world, would reflect our common\ndetermination to make it a more effective, more\nlegitimate and more representative body.\nOur peoples are waiting. They are waiting for us\nto lead them forward towards rebirth in the new\ncentury, towards the building of a new world, rich in\ndiversity, more just and more united.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI extend to you,\nMr. President, my felicitations on your election. I also\ncongratulate your predecessor, Dr. Han Seung-soo, for\nhis able stewardship of the preceding session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nWe commend Secretary-General Kofi Annan for\nhis commitment and dedicated efforts in the pursuit of\nthe Charter's purposes and principles. I also\ncongratulate Switzerland and East Timor on their\nadmission as members of the United Nations.\nLast year, this Assembly met under the shadow of\nthe terrorist attacks on New York, our host city. The\nhorror of that day galvanized the international\ncommunity to combat this modern day evil which\nthreatens to destabilize our societies.\nPakistan is in the forefront of the fight against\nterrorism. We have made major sacrifices in this war.\nWe have interdicted infiltration by Al-Qaida into\nPakistan. We have arrested and deported foreign\nsuspects found on our territory. We are determined not\nto allow anyone to use our soil for terrorist acts inside\nor outside Pakistan.\nHowever, some quarters are unfortunately\nutilizing the war against terrorism as a vehicle to\nspread hatred against Islam and Muslims. Terrorism\nhas neither creed nor religion. In a globalized world,\nreligious and cultural diversity should be a vehicle for\ncomplementary creativity and dynamism, not the\nrationale for a new ideological or political\nconfrontation. A sustained dialogue between the\nIslamic and Western nations is essential to remove the\nveil of ignorance and prejudice and to promote\nharmony and cooperation. As a first step, may I\npropose that the General Assembly consider the\nadoption of a declaration on religious and cultural\nunderstanding, harmony and cooperation.\nThere is a need to address the root causes of\nterrorism. It is not religion which impels a terrorist act;\nit is often a sense of frustration and powerlessness to\nredress persistent injustices. When a people's right to\nself-determination and freedom are brutally suppressed\nby foreign occupation, they may be driven to put up\n15\n\nresistance by all means. Terrorist attacks must be\ncondemned, but acts of terrorism by individuals or\ngroups cannot be the justification to outlaw the just\nstruggle of a people for self-determination and\nliberation from colonial or foreign occupation, nor can\nit justify state terrorism.\nMisusing the rationale of war against terrorism,\nIndia has sought to delegitimize the Kashmiri freedom\nstruggle, tarnish Pakistan with the brush of terrorism\nand drive a wedge between Pakistan and its coalition\npartners. Boasting of its coercive capability, India has\ndeployed about a million troops in battle formation\nagainst Pakistan. Such threatening and aggressive\nposturing will not resolve disputes. We in Pakistan\ncannot be coerced or frightened into compromising our\nprincipled position on Kashmir.\nThe conflict in occupied Kashmir is being waged\nby the Kashmiris themselves. No amount of external\nassistance could have inspired the Kashmiri people to\nsacrifice the lives of 80,000 of their youth and to\nsustain their struggle for decades against India's\noccupation army.\nIndia's planned elections in Kashmir will once\nagain be rigged. Such elections, under Indian\noccupation, will not help peace. They may set it back,\nin fact. The people of Jammu and Kashmir must be\nallowed to exercise their right to determine their own\nfuture in accordance with the relevant resolutions of\nthe Security Council.\nDespite India's provocations and threats over the\npast year, Pakistan has acted with restraint and\nresponsibility. We have advanced several peace\nproposals. They have all been spurned by India. Let me\ndeclare from this rostrum: Pakistan will not start a\nconflict with India. But let me also declare that, if war\nis thrust upon us, we shall exercise our right to self-\ndefence fully and very effectively.\nToday, peace in South Asia is hostage to one\naccident, one act of terrorism, one strategic\nmiscalculation by India. In this dangerous situation,\ncrisis management should not be allowed to become a\nsubstitute for conflict resolution. The steps required to\navoid a conflict and advance peace in South Asia are\nclear: first, mutual withdrawal of forward-deployed\nforces by both States; secondly, observance of a\nceasefire along the Line of Control in Kashmir; and,\nfinally, cessation of India's state terrorism against the\nKashmiri people. Simultaneously to all this, a dialogue\nmust be resumed between India and Pakistan. The\nstructure for such a dialogue was agreed between Prime\nMinister Vajpayee and myself at Agra. The Kashmiris\nshould be fully associated with the dialogue on\nKashmir and should be allowed to travel freely to\nPakistan and Azad Kashmir.\nTo ensure sustainable peace and stability in South\nAsia, a Kashmir solution should be accompanied by\nagreed measures for nuclear restraint and a\nconventional arms balance between India and Pakistan.\nIndia's ongoing massive military build-up reflects its\nknown desire for domination over South Asia and the\nIndian Ocean. In the interest of regional and global\nstability, this must be discouraged.\nIndia's belligerence also reflects the chauvinistic\nideology of the Hindu extremist parties and\norganizations. Rising Hindu fanaticism in India has\ntargeted Muslims, Christians, Sikhs and even the\nscheduled-caste Hindus. Last February, an estimated\n2,000 innocent Muslims were massacred and burned\nalive in Gujarat with the complicity of the Bharatiya\nJanata Party's state leaders. There must be\naccountability for this massacre. The international\ncommunity must act to oppose extremism in India with\nthe same determination it has displayed in combating\nterrorism, religious bigotry, ethnic cleansing and fascist\ntendencies elsewhere in the world.\nEven as Hindu fundamentalism is rising in India,\nPakistan is waging a successful struggle to restore its\ntraditions of a tolerant Islam. We are acting vigorously\nto eradicate the sad legacy of the Afghanistan war:\nreligious extremism, drugs and guns. We in Pakistan\nare determined to transform into reality the vision of\nour founding father, the Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali\nJinnah, for a progressive, modern, democratic Islamic\nState. We wish to play a constructive role in promoting\npeace and prosperity in South Asia, Central Asia and\nthe Gulf region.\nIn three short years, my Government has laid the\nfoundations of sustainable development and sustainable\ndemocracy in Pakistan. We have empowered the people\nby devolving decision-making to the grass-roots level.\nWe have improved human rights, virtually eliminated\nexploitive child labour and empowered the women of\nPakistan. We have rationalized economic policies and,\ndespite internal and external shocks, set Pakistan on the\npath of sustained economic growth. Pakistan has also\nbecome the first country to set up a human\n16\n\ndevelopment fund, with the collaboration of the United\nNations Development Programme, and a national\nvolunteers corps for the achievement of the millennium\ngoals of poverty alleviation and human development.\nIn 30 days, we will hold national, provincial and\nSenate elections, completing the process of restoring\ntrue democracy in Pakistan.\nWe in Pakistan remain extremely happy with the\npositive changes in Afghanistan after two decades of\nconflict. We fully support President Hamid Karzai. We\nappreciate the efforts of the Secretary-General and his\nSpecial Representative, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, to bring\nhope and peace to the long-suffering Afghan people.\nWe believe that faithful implementation of the Bonn\nprocess and the Tokyo commitments is essential for\nsuccess. Ensuring credible security in Kabul and other\ncentres is of paramount importance. This was brought\nhome by the attempt made a few days ago to\nassassinate President Karzai.\nThe international community must urgently\nrevive the Middle East peace process also to realize a\ncomprehensive and just peace on the basis of Security\nCouncil resolutions and the principle of land for peace.\nPakistan supports the full and faithful\nimplementation of all Security Council resolutions.\nIn our globalizing yet divided world, the most\nimportant war we must fight is the war against poverty.\nThe objectives of this war have been identified \u2014 at\nthe Millennium Summit, at Doha, Monterrey and\nJohannesburg. We must implement the commitments\nmade in an integrated and coherent manner.\nLet me state here that a pernicious aspect of the\ninternational banking system is the stashing away in\nsecret accounts in developed countries of money\nacquired illegally by corrupt elite from developing\ncountries. An international regime to interdict and\nreturn illegally acquired wealth to the developing\ncountries will make a genuine contribution to the\nreduction of corruption and poverty alleviation in those\ncountries.\nDespite current differences among Governments,\npeople from both rich and poor nations are beginning\nto embrace universal values and common goals:\navoiding war; ending poverty, hunger, disease,\ndiscrimination and human rights violations; promoting\ndemocracy; sharing technology; creating decent work\nfor all; and protecting the environment. We must\ncapture this growing spirit of global humanism to\nadvance the quest for global prosperity and universal\npeace. This can be accomplished only by the United\nNations.\nOur decisions and actions today will shape events\nof the future. We must rid ourselves of forces of\nintolerance and radicalism. We have to create a safer\nworld for our future generations \u2014 a world of peace\nand conciliation, not one of conflict and tension.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Allow me, on behalf of my delegation,\nto extend to you our wholehearted congratulations on\nyour election as the President of the present session. I\nwish to assure you of my delegation's support and\ncooperation throughout your tenure of office.\nI also wish to convey my thanks to His\nExcellency Dr. Han Seung-soo of the Republic of\nKorea for the remarkable manner in which he\nconducted the work of the Assembly's fifty-sixth\nsession. United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan\nalso deserves our gratitude for his inspiring and\ncommendable initiatives in furthering the objectives of\nour Organization.\nWe are happy that the Swiss Confederation and\nTimor-Leste have joined us as the newest members of\nthe United Nations family. Timor-Leste stands out as a\nshining accomplishment of the United Nations system\nto uphold the right to independence of a nation in\nadverse conditions.\nThe terrorist atrocities of 11 September will never\nfade from our collective consciousness, and the agony\nand the pain of the day are still with us. The\nsophisticated infrastructure of the terrorist\norganizations that was utilized to inflict that\nmonstrosity must be dismantled at any cost. We owe it\nto ourselves and to the generations that will come after\nus to mobilize all our energies and efforts to never let\nthat happen again, anywhere.\nMauritius is committed to remain fully engaged\nin the global coalition against terrorism, and we shall\ncontinue, together with other States, to take all\nmeasures  nationally, regionally and internationally \nso that the scourge of terrorism is never inflicted on\nunsuspecting civilians and countries. We are alive to\nthe chilling reality that no country is or ever will be\nsafe until the war against terrorism is finally and\ncompletely won. We condemn cross-border infiltration;\nit must stop and must be made to stop.\nThe threats posed by international terrorism have\nheightened the need for collective action to preserve\nworld peace and security. While we combine our\nefforts to wage a war on terrorism, we should, at the\nsame time, continue to work towards global\ndisarmament and a complete elimination of weapons of\nmass destruction within a specified time frame. My\ndelegation reiterates its appeal for the early convening\nof a conference on nuclear disarmament.\nThe term of Mauritius as an elected non-\npermanent member of the Security Council will end in\n20\n\nDecember this year. During its tenure on the Council,\nMauritius was instrumental in the establishment of an\nad hoc working group on conflict prevention and\nresolution in Africa. It has made positive and\nconstructive recommendations that have been endorsed\nby the Security Council.\nIn contrast to previous years, when the General\nAssembly listened to a litany of horror stories out of\nAfrica, I am happy to note that substantial and positive\ndevelopments are taking place on the continent. There\nis a new dawn in Africa and the stark realization that,\nwithout enduring peace and stability, there will be no\nsustainable development.\nWe congratulate the African leaders who have\nspared no effort in the search for African solutions to\nAfrican conflicts and crises. The Pretoria Agreement\nbetween Presidents Kabila and Kagame represents a\nmajor breakthrough for the peace process in the Great\nLakes region. We are aware that the implementation\nwill be difficult. We are, however, confident that the\ninternational community will provide all necessary\nassistance to the leaders in the region for a smooth\nimplementation.\nWith the positive developments in Angola, the\nsuccessful general elections in Sierra Leone, the\nsettlement of the boundary problem between Eritrea\nand Ethiopia and the progress made in the\nimplementation of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation\nAgreement for Burundi, there are clear signals that\nsome of the major conflicts in Africa are being\nsuccessfully resolved.\nAs Africa embarks on the road of peace, we wish\nto underscore the crucial role played by the\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development, the\nEconomic Community of West African States and the\nSouthern African Development Community in their\nrelentless search for negotiated settlement of the\nconflicts in our respective subregions. There is cause\nfor optimism, and it is gratifying that the days of doom\nand gloom for Africa are on their way to extinction.\nOur region, the Indian Ocean, which has\nwitnessed some turbulent times recently, is again\npoised for stability and development. We applaud the\nreturn to constitutional rule in the Comoros and the\nconsolidation of democratic institutions in that country.\nWe also welcome the formation of a Government of\nnational reconciliation in Madagascar and the efforts\nunder way to undo the damage caused by the recent\ncrisis there. Mauritius will be closely associated with\nthe countries of our region to further enhance regional\ncooperation.\nThe launching of the African Union in Durban,\nSouth Africa, in July this year was indeed a historic\nand emotionally charged occasion. The birth of the\nAfrican Union heralds a new era of political, economic\nand social transformation for our continent. The\ncontinent is more than ever determined to shape its\ndestiny and to tackle comprehensively the burning\nproblems of poverty, hunger, disease and\nunderdevelopment that have debilitated millions of\nAfricans over the years. The African Union has raised\nexpectations that we, as leaders, are committed to\nhonour. The African Union will be able to respond in a\npositive manner to the challenges confronting it, as\nwell as maximizing the opportunities for the\nimprovement of the lives of peoples of the continent. In\nthat context, the decision of African countries to take\nresponsibility for peacekeeping on the continent needs\nto be encouraged. Since the burden of peacekeeping\nmust be equitably shared, I am pleased to announce\nthat Mauritius will contribute to the United Nations\ncivilian police for service in post-conflict operations.\nAlong with the launching of the African Union,\nthe home-grown New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment (NEPAD) is another chapter in the\nunfolding of the success story of the African continent.\nNEPAD commits Africa to building a strong and\nenduring culture of democracy, respect for human\nrights and accountability for the continent. Indeed, the\nAfrican Peer Review Mechanism is a credible\nmechanism to promote the prospects of internationally\nrecognized norms and standards of good governance.\nThe establishment of the International Criminal\nCourt (ICC) marks a watershed in mankind's quest to\nput an end to impunity and to bring to justice those\nresponsible for crimes against humanity, for genocide\nand for international crimes. The ICC is the single most\nimportant institution of this millennium, and it is the\nduty of the international community to fully support it.\nIn May this year, during the special session on\nchildren, Mauritius had the opportunity to join the\ninternational efforts to pave the way for effective\nprotection for every child in every part of the world.\nThe children who addressed the gathering uttered\nwords of great significance that no one can, or should,\never forget. The future is theirs, and it is for them that\n21\n\nwe ought to ensure the sustainable development of our\none and only planet. My country will ensure that the\nprinciples, goals and actions discussed during the\nspecial session are integrated in our various child\nwelfare programmes.\nThe Middle East is still not at peace. The death\ntoll rises every day, but we are encouraged by the\nsignals being sent by both the Israelis and the\nPalestinian leadership. Our vision of the Middle East is\nto see the early establishment of a Palestinian State\nliving side by side with Israel on the basis of agreed\nand secure boundaries. The Palestinians also need to\nhave State machinery that observes the fundamental\nnorms of a democratic system, with responsibility and\naccountability on the part of the leaders. They alone\nhave the absolute right to elect their leaders when\nelections are held in January 2003.\nWe appeal to the Iraqi authorities to comply fully\nand unconditionally with Security Council resolutions\nwith respect to allowing the arms inspectors to fulfil\ntheir mandate.\nSmall island developing States are a particularly\nvulnerable group of countries by virtue of their\ninherent natural and structural constraints. The World\nBank; the Commonwealth; the United Nations\nConference on Financing for Development, held in\nMonterrey, Mexico; and the World Summit on\nSustainable Development, held recently in\nJohannesburg, South Africa, have all recognized that\nthose constraints, if not addressed effectively, could\nundermine the trade and development prospects of\nthese countries, leading to their further\nmarginalization. We look forward to specific and\nconcrete recommendations for action in this regard at\nthe Fifth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade\nOrganization scheduled to be held next September in\nMexico.\nThe World Summit on Sustainable Development\naddressed the fundamental question of what kind of\nworld we want for ourselves and for generations that\nare yet unborn. The recent devastating floods in Europe\nand Asia, as well as the droughts in many parts of\nAfrica  particularly Southern Africa, where there are\nmore than 13 million people in danger of famine  are\na stark reminder of the fragility of our planet's\necosystem. The World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment has made the whole world conscious of\nthe havoc that nature may cause unless drastic\nmeasures are taken immediately to redress the\necological imbalance.\n(spoke in French)\nThe Ninth Summit of La Francophonie, which\nLebanon will host next month and which will be held\non the topic dialogue of cultures', will undoubtedly\nenable the French-speaking community to foster\nsharing among various cultures with a view to\nmaintaining peace, security and democracy.\n(spoke in English)\nMauritius reaffirms its legitimate sovereignty\nover the Chagos Archipelago, including the island of\nDiego Garcia, which was detached from the territory of\nMauritius by the United Kingdom prior to our\nindependence. We renew our call to the former colonial\nPower, the United Kingdom, to accelerate discussions\nwith us for an early settlement of this issue. The\npersons of Mauritian origin who were displaced from\nthe Chagos Archipelago continue to claim redress for\nthe serious human rights violations that they endured.\nWe support their efforts to seek redress.\nWe also call on the French Government to work\ntowards the resolution of the dispute concerning\nTromelin Island, over which Mauritius has sovereignty.\nIn conclusion, Mauritius reiterates its conviction\nthat the United Nations system remains the best\nguarantee for international peace and security.\nThe framework within which the United Nations\norganizes the collective security of States may not be\nperfect, but it is at least one that is tested and has\nserved us relatively well for more than 50 years.\nWorking on the basis of the neutrality of rules and\nprinciples is far preferable to the haphazardness of\nexpediency. We also should not be unmindful of the\nlinkages which exist between different situations, and\nthat is why we urge the international community to\nobserve the principle of equality of treatment in all\ncases.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMy delegation would like to say that the leadership\nshown by the President in presiding over this session\nmakes us confident that our deliberations will continue\nin a spirit of dynamism and optimism for the\ndevelopment of international relations. Niger is very\nhappy to convey to the President and to other members\nof the Bureau of the fifty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly our heartfelt congratulations.\nWe remain convinced that President Kavan will\nfollow up the remarkable work done by his\npredecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo of the Republic of\nKorea, with the same human qualities for the good of\nthe international community as a whole.\nI wish to reiterate to our brother, His Excellency\nMr. Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the United\nNations, the congratulations of the people of Niger for\nthe prestige and effectiveness of his deeply appreciated\nwork done in the service of humanity.\nI also wish to congratulate the Swiss\nConfederation on becoming a new Member, and Timor-\nLeste, as an imminent Member of the Organization. We\nare convinced that their participation will help enrich\nour debates.\nThe American people have been mourning the\ntragic events of 11 September 2001 for a year now. The\nwhole world has taken full measure of the threat that\nterrorism poses to peace and security. In Niger, we\ncannot stress the fact enough that, in order to be\neffective, the fight against terrorism must avoid taking\na piecemeal approach. It must be long term and it must\nbe conducted within the framework of international\nlegality, which is epitomized by the United Nations.\n22\n\nNiger agrees with the provisions of Security\nCouncil resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001), and\nit is firmly committed to all subregional, regional and\ninternational initiatives aimed at combating terrorism\nin all its forms.\nAt the same time, in order to succeed in the fight\nagainst terrorism, we must take into account the need\nto develop a more just and equitable economic and\npolitical order, since it has been shown that poverty,\nignorance, injustice and all kinds of frustrations are\nfactors that can produce blind extremism.\nSpeaking of international peace and security, I am\npleased to recall that Niger is a peaceful country that\ncontributes actively to efforts to achieve general and\ncomplete disarmament. In that regard, I would like to\npoint out that in that field, my country, pursuant to\narticle 3 of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons, has accepted an agreement with the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, on a system of\nmonitoring and safeguards for its uranium production.\nRegarding conventional weapons, Niger is happy that\nthe United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects has\nadopted a programme of action to combat that scourge.\nOur concerns were taken into account in the\nBamako Declaration, but there is still work to be done,\nparticularly in terms of technical and financial\nassistance measures to support disarmament\nprogrammes and reintegration programmes for former\ncombatants. While it is true that no region of the world\nhas been spared, there is no doubt that developing\ncountries, particularly African countries, are the ones\nsuffering the most from the devastating effects of the\nproliferation of light arms and small weapons in terms\nof their security, stability and development. That is\nwhy the bodies charged with monitoring, detecting and\nprosecuting infractions committed along those lines\nmust be strengthened.\nSince 1994, Niger has had in place the National\nCommission for Collecting and Controlling Illicit\nWeapons, whose task is to help the political authorities\nat the highest level identify, design and put implement\nstrategies to fight the proliferation of light weapons.\nIn that context, the Government of Niger and the\nDepartment for Disarmament Affairs of our\nOrganization are cooperating closely for the success of\na project to collect illegal small arms and light\nweapons for the entire West African subregion. That is\na part of the regional and subregional initiatives aimed\nat cutting off the illicit movement of small arms and\nlight weapons.\nThe peace that we wish for Niger is the same\npeace we wish for the rest of the world. That is why\nour country has always tried to make its modest\ncontribution to settling conflicts that threaten peace and\nsecurity in Africa and throughout the world. In spite of\nour limited resources, we have sent contingents to\nLiberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau, the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo and civilian police officers to\nHaiti, Timor and Kosovo, to support the efforts of the\nEconomic Community of West African States\n(ECOWAS) and the international community to restore\nand consolidate peace.\nThe Government of Niger reaffirms its ongoing\navailability to send contingents to all United Nations\npeacekeeping operations.\nFor a few months now the international\ncommunity's attention has been focused on the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict, whose peace process is now more\nparalysed than ever. Niger wants once again to reaffirm\nbefore the Assembly that a permanent settlement of the\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict necessarily requires\nestablishing the inalienable rights of the Palestinian\npeople, including the creation of an independent,\nsovereign and viable Palestinian State. On the basis of\nthat conviction and in light of all kinds of false starts\nthat have characterized the peace process in Palestine\nand the Middle East, Niger has made a sovereign\ndecision to break off its diplomatic relations with\nIsrael, which continues to deny the Palestinian people\ntheir legitimate right to self-determination.\nIn Western Sahara, the Republic of Niger\nsupports the efforts of the United Nations, on one hand,\nto enforce the settlement plan and, on the other hand,\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions, in order to\nachieve a just and comprehensive settlement of the\nconflict. The laudable action of the Secretary-General\nand his Personal Envoy, Mr. James Baker, should be\nfollowed up and supported until a positive conclusion\nis achieved, in accordance with the relevant United\nNations resolutions.\nIn that context, we think that United Nations\nresolutions on Jammu and Kashmir must be speedily\nimplemented so that the Kashmiri people can exercise\ntheir right to self-determination, which would allow to\ndefuse that hotbed that involves two nuclear States \u2014\n23\n\nIndia and Pakistan \u2014 and to avoid a serious threat to\npeace and security in the South Asia region. Therefore,\nNiger, a member of the contact group established by\nthe Organization of the Islamic Conference, reiterates\nthe appeal already made to the two parties to step up\ntheir negotiations in order to achieve a peaceful\nsettlement of that conflict.\nNiger, like almost all African countries, faces a\nnumber of major challenges, which require the\ninternational community to provide the necessary\nsupport to help them in the search for solutions and in\nconsolidating their economic renewal programme.\nFrom that standpoint, the developmental strategy that\nwe have implemented gives priority to the culture and\nthe promotion of good governance through a good-\nconduct mechanism and public affairs management that\nfocuses on concerns such as transparency and civil\nsociety participation in all socio-economic decisions.\nThis is the time to sincerely thanks all the bilateral and\nmultilateral partners of Niger, particularly the United\nNations institutions, for having been kind enough to\ncontinue to support the efforts of my country to create\nan institutional environment conducive to giving us\nsocial peace. That assistance is much appreciated and\nis necessary in this critical phase of the national\nconstruction process.\nIn economic terms, never before has mankind had\nso much wealth and potential overall to generate\ncommon benefit. The positive world economic\nsituation could give us hope to establish a more just\neconomic order that would be more conducive to\npoverty reduction. In that regard, Niger welcomes the\nnew partnership, the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment (NEPAD), and we believe that that\nprogramme, which crystallizes the hopes of our\ncontinent today, must be aimed at bringing together the\nnecessary conditions and means for the effective\nparticipation of all African countries to the\nmultidimensional developmental process within the\nframework of the African Union.\nPoverty is an affront that can no longer be\ntolerated in a world of abundance that has the means to\nvanquish it if there is the necessary political will.\nToday, we must note that 52 per cent of people who\nlive on less than a dollar a day are found in Africa,\nwhich is the most indebted part of the world.\nA clear look must be taken at globalization,\nwhich in the 1990s gave rise to hopes but today is a\nsource of concern because of the growing inequalities\nit is creating. In less than a year, we have discussed\nglobal problems four times, and we know the true\nremedies. We need a more elevated concept of\ninternational cooperation that draws its essence from\nstrategic partnership. However, we can rejoice in the\nunanimous will that the international community\naffirmed in adopting the Johannesburg Plan of Action\nin September.\nThe special session of the General Assembly\ndevoted to HIV/AIDS, held in July 2001, demonstrated\neloquently our degree of awareness of the terrible\ndanger that that disease represents for the human\nspecies. The establishment of a special fund to fight\nAIDS is an important step in the world crusade against\nAIDS and other major epidemics. Progress must be\nmade within the framework of initiatives undertaken by\nthe world Summits held at Cairo, at Copenhagen and at\nBeijing.\nMy country expects a greater degree of solidarity\nfrom the industrialized countries, particularly with\nregard to increasing the volume of official development\nassistance, a traditional development source. At the\nsame time, we must unite our efforts to mobilize\nfinancial resources and to establish a humanitarian\nfund under United Nations auspices. It is indispensable\nand urgent that we reverse the trend of declining\nofficial development assistance, which, the Assembly\nwill recall, is at its lowest level in 50 years. In fact,\nmany difficulties have conspired to keep our countries\nat the bottom of the human development index. The\nstate of poverty affects 63 per cent of our compatriots,\nand 34 per cent of them live below the extreme poverty\nline. Those populations, deprived of minimal basic\nsocial services, are the victims of a continued\ndeterioration in their standard of living.\nThe growing scarcity of financial resources has\ncaused, among other things, a drastic decline in public\ninvestment, particularly in the social sectors, thus\ndepriving 80 per cent of Niger's rural citizens of basic\nsocial benefits. Niger has decided to undertake\nmeasures to reverse that trend through its poverty\nreduction strategy, which was formulated and\nimplemented after a participative process. Its goal is to\nsubstantially reduce the suffering of 80 per cent of the\npopulation. That strategy is now the only frame of\nreference for Niger's economic, financial and social\npolicies.\n24\n\nThis year, under the direct supervision of the\nPresident of the Republic, we have launched an\nextensive programme, called Special Programme 2001,\nwhich consists of building 1,000 classrooms, 1,000\ndispensaries and 100 mini-dams to fight poverty. A\ngood part \u2014 more than 80 per cent \u2014 of that operation\nhas already been completed.\nI should also like to express again from this\npodium our deep appreciation for the support that our\ndevelopmental partners have continued to give us for\nthe implementation of our National Framework\nProgramme to fight poverty, which Niger formulated\nand which is among our highest priorities. However,\nthe crucial problem of African debt, which is\nannihilating all our development efforts, calls for an\neffort by the entire international community to help us\nto implement \u2014 without delay or any conditions other\nthan those of good governance \u2014 satisfactory policies\nand mechanisms for its solution.\nThe United Nations remains the best instrument\nfor helping us realize the new world order to which we\nall aspire, so long as we carry forward the so-called\nquiet revolution begun by the Secretary-General four\nyears ago. In conclusion, I should like to express the\nfull confidence that Niger and its people place in the\nUnited Nations, which remains an institution of hope\nbased on the principles of justice, equity, peace and\nprogress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I look forward to\nworking closely with him as the Czech Republic, a\ngood friend of my country, moves ever closer to\nmembership in the European Union. Our thanks are due\nto Mr. Han Seung-soo for his work as President of the\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. I am\ndelighted to welcome Switzerland as a new Member of\nthe Organization and look forward to the imminent\nmembership of East Timor, a nation whose birth was\nfostered by this Organization.\nPrime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark has\nalready addressed the General Assembly on behalf of\nthe European Union. Ireland associates itself fully with\nhis remarks.\nWe are all still haunted, a year later, by the\nshadow of the terrible deaths and events of 11\nSeptember 2001. Last year in the delayed general\ndebate, I spoke about the implications of those\natrocities. I set out my thoughts on how we as the\ninternational community should respond. My\nconclusions last year and my message today are the\nsame.\nThe United Nations is at the centre of our system\nof collective security. It is a mirror of our\ndetermination and our political will. This is the world\nbody invested by the peoples of the world with unique\nlegitimacy and unique authority. Around the world\npeople look in hope and idealism to the United\nNations. We must be worthy of that trust.\nI want to fully endorse the Secretary-General's\naddress to the Assembly yesterday. As the Secretary-\nGeneral said, All States have a clear interest, as well\nas a clear responsibility, to uphold international law\nand maintain international order' (see A/57/PV.2).\nStates must honour their international obligations.\nUnless we consistently call to account those who defy\nor flagrantly violate their obligations, our system will\nbe discredited.\nThe choice we face is stark. Either we stand by\nand strengthen the international system and the rule of\nlaw, or we invite anarchy. The great Irish poet W. B.\nYeats put it graphically in The Second Coming':\nThings fall apart; the centre cannot hold;\nMere anarchy is loosed upon the world'.\nThat was what the perpetrators of 11 September\nwanted. Their vicious attack was not just on the\ninnocent people  of many nationalities, including my\nown  in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania;\nnot just on the United States; but on the very values we\ncherish and that are the foundation on which this\nOrganization is built. They will have succeeded if we\nare provoked into abandoning those values and laws.\nUltimately they can be defeated, and the scourge of\ninternational terror ended, only if we stand united in\ndefence of our international obligations and the rule of\nlaw.\nWithin our system, the Security Council is\ncharged with responsibility for the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. When there are threats\nto international peace and security, the Member States\nconcerned are obliged to bring these matters to the\nattention of the Security Council. When the Security\nCouncil acts in such cases, all Member States are\nobliged to implement its resolutions. Regrettably, they\nsometimes fail to do so.\nAny law that is flagrantly violated becomes\nweakened over time. That is why flagrant violation and\ndefiance of Security Council resolutions should be a\nmatter of the utmost concern to all Member States.\nThe terrorist attacks of 11 September required an\nurgent response from the international community. It\nwas vital that the Security Council was at the centre of\nthe international community's response. The Council,\nto quote the Secretary-General, responded with\npatience, creativity and determination'.\nThe Security Council adopted resolution 1368\n(2001), demanding the fullest possible cooperation of\nthe international community in bringing the\nperpetrators to justice. It subsequently authorized the\ndeployment of an international security force to\nAfghanistan. It put in place measures to counter\ninternational terrorism.\n30\n\nThe establishment by the Security Council of the\nCounter-Terrorism Committee to oversee the\nimplementation of resolution 1373 (2001) was a\nlandmark development. Its work has been instrumental\nin making it more difficult for international terrorist\nnetworks to organize and finance their activities.\nContinued persistence and vigilance are required.\nWe still have much more to do. We must make it\nimpossible for the agents of international terror to\noperate. We must persevere with initiatives such as the\nfreezing of assets and the denial of safe haven. At the\nsame time, we must ensure that everything we do\nrespects the United Nations Charter and the body of\ninternational human rights law we have so\npainstakingly constructed. That is our best guarantee\nagainst evil and its perpetrators.\nIn his address to the General Assembly yesterday,\nthe Secretary-General also correctly identified four\nserious current threats to world peace.\nFirst, on the Middle East, there can be no doubt\nthat there is a need for greater urgency in the efforts to\nbring an end to the conflict. The vision of Security\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 1397\n(2002) must be implemented.\nFor far too long the Palestinian people have been\ndenied their legitimate rights. Today they exist in a\nstate of deep impoverishment. Ireland strongly believes\nthat in order to reach a settlement that will give the\nIsraeli people the security they deserve and that will\ngive the Palestinian people their legitimate rights and\nsovereignty, the parties must move forward. They must\nin particular address not just the security issues but\nalso the economic and humanitarian needs of\nPalestinians, and they must establish a concrete target\nfor a political settlement.\nFor its part, the European Union, working closely\nwith the United Nations, the United States and Russia\nthrough the quartet', will continue to encourage and\nassist the parties to end the conflict and move towards\na permanent peace.\nThis conflict has been an ongoing source of\nsuffering for the peoples of the region and also a focal\npoint of instability for the rest of the world. It remains\na threat of the utmost gravity to international peace and\nsecurity. We can and must give it the highest priority.\nSecondly, the Secretary-General mentioned Iraq.\nIraq has been in violation of Security Council\nresolutions, in particular on arms inspection, for some\nconsiderable time. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has\nbeen engaged in serious efforts to encourage Iraq to\ncomply with its obligations under those Security\nCouncil resolutions. We will continue to strongly\nsupport his good offices.\nLet us express wholehearted agreement with the\ncall by the Secretary-General for Iraq to comply with\nits obligations for the sake of its own people and for\nthe sake of world order. If Iraq's defiance continues,\nthe Security Council must face its responsibilities.\nWe call on Iraq to respect its obligations and to\nimplement in full and without preconditions all the\nSecurity Council resolutions addressed to it. The\nweapons inspectors must be allowed in to do the work\nauthorized by the Council. Iraq's leadership has it\nwithin its own power to end the current predicament\nand to alleviate the great hardship on its people. It\nshould do so without delay.\nThirdly, it is essential for the international\ncommunity to maintain its strong and active support for\nthe people and the Government of Afghanistan.\nAfghanistan has come through great trials over the past\nyear. We should not overlook the fact that, despite the\nbest efforts of the international coalition to ensure that\nthe use of force was targeted and proportionate, many\ninnocent Afghans have died. We should remember\nthem, too, in our thoughts and prayers. Ultimately, they\nare just as much victims of the terrorist groups who\ncarried out the attacks of 11 September as those who\nwere murdered in New York, Washington and\nPennsylvania.\nConsiderable progress has been achieved in\nAfghanistan with the help of the international\ncommunity. There are clear signs that, overall, the\nquality of life is improving. Nonetheless, there is still a\nlong way to go if Afghanistan is completely to escape\nthe violence and instability of the past.\nThe humanitarian situation in Afghanistan\nremains acute. The sustained and wholehearted support\nof the international community remains essential,\ntherefore, if progress is to be maintained.\nFor its part, Ireland has been active in the\nSecurity Council, particularly in highlighting the\nhumanitarian situation. We have pledged $12 million\nover the next three years, the majority of which has\n31\n\nalready been dispensed. We are also contributing\npersonnel to the international stabilization force.\nFourthly, as regards India and Pakistan, we\nwelcome the decrease in tension between these two\ncountries. The risk of open conflict between two\nnuclear-capable countries is a matter of the utmost\nconcern to all of us. We encourage the leaders of India\nand Pakistan to address the underlying causes that give\nrise to the potential for conflict.\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction  chemical, biological and nuclear  is,\nof course, an issue that goes far beyond Iraq. They\nrepresent a major threat to international peace and\nsecurity. The international instruments and regimes to\ncontrol the spread, and bring about the elimination, of\nsuch weapons must be strengthened and fully\nimplemented. Ultimately, the long-term control and\nelimination of weapons of mass destruction can be\nachieved only through a comprehensive and rigorous\nsystem of international treaties and obligations that are\nverifiable and universal.\nIreland, together with our New Agenda partners,\nwill continue its efforts in this regard during this year's\nsession of the General Assembly. We call on all States\nthat are concerned about these issues to become more\nconstructively engaged in the period ahead.\nAll of us recognize that conflict prevention, not\njust conflict resolution, is the central challenge facing\nthe United Nations. Poverty, inequality and injustice\nare all too often the breeding ground for instability and\nfor threats to peace. They are an affront to the\ninternational conscience. We must tackle the injustices\nthat all too often allow conflict situations to develop.\nOur challenge is to show that there is a peaceful\nand legitimate way of dealing with these problems. It is\nonly through the development of integrated strategies\nthat address the underlying causes of conflict \npoverty, injustice and the abuse of fundamental rights\nand freedoms  that the international community can\nbring about long-term peace and stability.\nThe Millennium Summit Declaration confirmed\nthe commitment of the world's leadership to tackling\nthe root causes of conflict. The Secretary-General has\nsince called for the United Nations to move from a\nculture of reaction to a culture of prevention. Ireland\nfully supports the implementation of the Secretary-\nGeneral's report on conflict prevention (A/55/985).\nThe United Nations must be equipped with the\nnecessary tools to develop coherent conflict-prevention\npolicies. Let us commit ourselves to supporting the\nSecretary-General in his ongoing reform initiatives. We\nmust revitalize the General Assembly so that it can\nplay its proper role. Let us re-engage on reform of the\nSecurity Council so that it reflects modern geopolitical\nrealities. We need a Security Council which is as\nrepresentative as possible of the international\ncommunity, while being in a position to function\nefficiently, and we must provide the United Nations\nwith sufficient resources to meet its responsibilities.\nSustainable development focused on poverty\neradication is the most powerful instrument which the\ninternational community has to address the long-term\nroot causes of conflict and to promote peace. Let us\nalso remind ourselves of the international community's\nlong-standing commitment to meeting the United\nNations target of spending 0.7 per cent of gross\nnational product on overseas development assistance.\nAt the World Summit on Sustainable Development,\nheld in Johannesburg, my Prime Minister, Taoiseach\nBertie Ahern, confirmed Ireland's commitment to meet\nthat target by 2007.\nLet us restate our commitment to providing\nuniversal access to basic health care. We must be\nrelentless in the campaign to eliminate diseases such as\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. The spread of\nthose diseases threatens to undermine our development\nprogrammes. We must step up our efforts to eradicate\nthem. We must aim for the targets set out in the\nDeclaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, adopted by\nthe General Assembly in June 2001. We must ensure\nthat the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis\nand Malaria is adequately resourced.\nThe Johannesburg Summit agreed upon a global\ncomprehensive action plan for sustainable development\nwhich will help guide our policies and programmes in\nthe coming years. The Summit Declaration's\ncommitment on sustainable development has the\npotential to make an important contribution to conflict\nprevention, particularly in Africa.\nEffective conflict prevention is also about putting\nnecessary structures in place. The Brahimi report on\nUnited Nations peace operations (A/55/305)\nacknowledged the pressing need to establish both long-\nterm and short-term conflict prevention strategies. I\nwould like to reiterate Ireland's support for the\n32\n\nSecretary-General's initiatives and for the role that\nUnited Nations peacekeeping has to play in an\nintegrated conflict prevention strategy.\nPeacekeeping is at the heart of Ireland's\ncontribution to the United Nations. We are immensely\nproud of the contribution which Irish personnel have\nmade to United Nations peacekeeping. We reserve a\nspecial place in our hearts for those who have given\ntheir lives in the service of the United Nations. This\nwas demonstrated once again in a moving ceremony\nwhich was held to mark the standing down of the Irish\nbattalion from the United Nations Interim Force in\nLebanon after 24 years of service.\nAs a member of the European Union, Ireland\nwelcomes the deepening cooperation between the\nEuropean Union and the United Nations on conflict\nprevention and peacekeeping. This will be given\nfurther concrete expression when the European Union\ntakes over the United Nations police operation in\nBosnia and Herzegovina next January.\nRespect for human rights is a core dimension in\nconflict prevention. This is the very foundation on\nwhich peace and security surely depend. Human rights\nmust be integrated into all United Nations activities.\nThe entry into force of the Rome Statute establishing\nthe International Criminal Court sends a clear signal of\ndetermination to bring to justice those who perpetrate\ngenocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. I\nwould urge those who have not ratified the Rome\nStatute to do so. The international community is at its\nstrongest when it stands unified, bound together by the\nstrength of the rule of law.\nI would like to take the opportunity presented by\nthis address to the General Assembly to pay tribute to\nMary Robinson, former President of Ireland, who has\njust completed her term as United Nations High\nCommissioner for Human Rights. We are deeply proud\nof her achievements. We know that she will continue to\nbe a fearless champion of the universality of human\nrights.\nTurning to the situation in Northern Ireland, we\nhave seen substantial progress across the key areas of\nimplementation of the Good Friday Agreement since I\nlast addressed this Assembly. The political institutions\nof the Agreement are operating on a positive and\ninclusive basis, bringing tangible benefits across the\nboard. An independent international commission has\noverseen two acts of arms decommissioning by the\nIrish Republican Army. The Patten Commission\nreport's vision of a new beginning for policing in\nNorthern Ireland is being progressively realized. I call\non all to fully play their part in laying a foundation for\nand strengthening the new policing arrangements.\nWelcome progress has been made in normalizing\nsecurity arrangements on the ground. However, more\nneeds to be done, and we need to see further early\nprogress, especially in the South Armagh area.\nThe considerable record of achievement,\nhowever, has not made us complacent about the\ndifficulties and challenges that remain. The level of\nstreet violence in the interface areas of Belfast and the\nsectarian attacks on vulnerable households, for\ninstance, have given us all cause for serious concern.\nThese have had a corrosive effect on community\nconfidence. They need to be addressed urgently in all\ntheir dimensions, including through effective policing\nmeasures leading to convictions.\nThe Irish and British Governments remain\nabsolutely committed to the Good Friday Agreement\nand to its implementation in full. Its core principles \nconstitutional stability based on consent, partnership\npolitics, inclusive political institutions and structured\nNorth-South cooperation on the island of Ireland \nrepresent the only viable basis for a workable political\naccommodation. In short, the Agreement, which has\nbeen much praised and admired by States Members of\nthe Assembly, continues to be the only template for\npolitical progress in Northern Ireland.\nBefore concluding, I would like to refer briefly to\nIreland's membership of the Security Council, which\ncomes to an end on 31 December 2002. Ireland's\nexperience as a member of the Council has strongly\nreinforced our belief in the system of collective global\nsecurity. The central role of the Security Council in the\naftermath of 11 September 2001 underlined the\nimportance of its role as guardian of international\npeace and security. It must now build on that\nachievement. Ireland has, I believe, made a substantive\ncontribution to the work of the Council. We will seek\nto continue to do so in the remaining months of our\nterm. Our mission in the United Nations is to\ncontinually strive for a world that is fair and just. This\ncan best be done through our system of collective\nsecurity, through international economic and social\ndevelopment and through respect for human rights and\ninternational law. If we can commit ourselves to\nrespect the decisions of the Security Council and all\n33\n\nour other international obligations, then innocent lives\ncan be saved and seemingly interminable conflicts\nresolved.\nWe have the methods and the means to peaceably\nresolve the dangers that threaten us. It should not be\nbeyond our talent and resources to achieve this. But to\ndo so, we need to assert the core values of\nmultilateralism in particular, and its capacity to\nachieve, for all our people, a better and safer world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt gives\nme great pleasure to offer, on behalf of the Government\nof the Sultanate of Oman, our warmest congratulations\nto you, Sir, on your election as President of the General\nAssembly at its current session. We assure you of our\nfullest cooperation towards achieving the noble goals\nand objectives to which we collectively aspire for the\nbenefit of mankind and the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security.\nIn this connection, we wish to express our\nappreciation for the ongoing tireless efforts of\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan on behalf of\ninternational peace and security, the rule of\ninternational law and the work of the Organization in\nthis regard. We also thank him for his annual report,\nwhich details the achievements of the United Nations,\nthe obstacles ahead and its vision of the future,\nembodying the conscience and aspirations of the\ninternational community.\nI also take this opportunity to welcome the\naccession of the Swiss Federation and the Democratic\nRepublic of Timor-Leste to membership of the United\nNations. We are confident that their membership will\n22\n\nbe an important asset in the promotion of the work of\nthis Organization in achieving its noble goals of\ninternational peace and security.\nHere in the renowned city of New York, we are\ncommemorating the terrorist attacks of 11 September\n2001. Once again, we would like to express our deepest\nsympathies and condolences to the families of the\nvictims of that senseless attack. We wish also to\nreaffirm our solidarity with the United States of\nAmerica in fighting all forms of terror against innocent\npeople everywhere.\nThe Middle East is experiencing increased\ntension due to a serious regression in the peace process\non all tracks, particularly the Israeli-Palestinian track.\nThe primary causes of this are the Israeli Government's\ndeviation from the fair principles and foundations\nestablished at the 1991 Madrid Conference, and the\ndesire of successive Israeli Governments since 1996 to\nimpose peace through excessive force. This runs\ncounter to Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and\n338 (1973), and to the formula of land for peace. Israel\nis pursuing a policy of procrastination and intimidation\nand is circumventing international instruments and\nagreements signed by the parties concerned. This has\nresulted in a further escalation of Palestinian\nresistance, by all factions and in all forms, to Israeli\noccupation.\nMy Government condemns all terrorist acts,\nregardless of their motivation and deplores all acts of\nviolence against innocent civilians, whether perpetrated\nby the Palestinian or the Israeli side. Events have\nproven that the use of force against the Palestinian\npeople will not lead to a fair solution, to an end to\nviolence or to security, as the Israeli Government\nclaims; nor will it end the legitimate Palestinian\nresistance against Israeli occupation. The end of such\nresistance is contingent upon the end of Israeli\noccupation.\nAll Arab States have affirmed that the\nachievement of a peace based on the principles of\ninternational law and justice is our strategic choice, and\nwe have exerted great efforts to that end, the latest\nbeing the Arab peace initiative adopted unanimously at\nthe Beirut Summit held last March. This historic\ninitiative was widely welcomed by the international\ncommunity because it is in conformity with\ninternational legitimacy and principles, and in\ncompliance with Security Council resolutions 242\n(1967) and 338 (1973), which demand the withdrawal\nof Israel from the Arab territories occupied since June\n1967, including Al-Quds Al-Sharif, and the granting to\nPalestinian refugees of the right to return, in return for\nthe recognition of Israel by Arab States and the\nnormalization of relations with it.\nSecurity Council resolution 1397 (2002) sets out\nthe concept of establishing a recognized Palestinian\nState peacefully coexisting alongside the State of\nIsrael. In that connection, my Government calls on the\ninternational community, especially Security Council\nmembers, to shoulder their responsibility to ensure that\nthe Israeli Government will respect and implement\nrelevant international resolutions and respond seriously\nto Arab and international efforts.\nMy Government supports the just position taken\nby the Syrian Arab Republic with respect to regaining\nthe occupied Golan Heights and its request for Israeli\nwithdrawal to the line of 4 June 1967. In the same vein,\nwe support the position of the Republic of Lebanon\nwith regard to recovering the occupied Shab'a farms\narea and its demand that Israel fully implement\nSecurity Council resolution 425 (1978), which calls for\nthe immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces from all\nLebanese territory, including the Shab'a farms area.\nThe overall humanitarian situation in Iraq\nremains tragic due to the ongoing economic sanctions\nimposed on Iraq since August 1990. Consequently, my\nGovernment emphasizes the importance of a Security\nCouncil review of the international sanctions policy\nimposed on countries, a review that would lead to\neasing the humanitarian harm that befalls peoples, and\nthat would take into consideration the status of a\ntargeted Government's implementation of international\nresolutions.\nMy Government reiterates its call upon the\nSecurity Council to put an end to the human suffering\nin Iraq, and in that regard we call for the continuation\nof dialogue and discussions between Iraq and the\nUnited Nations with a view to Iraq fulfilling its\nremaining international commitments. The Security\nCouncil needs to put in place a clear-cut and specific\nmechanism telling Iraq what it needs to do to end the\ntragic suffering and to arrive at a final and complete\nlifting of the economic sanctions.\nWe feel optimistic and pleased at the\naccomplishments of the Arab Summit in Beirut,\nespecially in terms of its positive climate in creating a\n23\n\nspirit of understanding and rapprochement between\nIraq and Kuwait. In that connection, my Government\nwelcomes the Iraqi initiative to return the Kuwaiti\nnational archives and urges the Iraqi Government to\npersist with the option of continuous and constructive\ndialogue and serious consultations to fulfil its\nunfulfilled commitments under Security Council\nresolutions, specifically relating to prisoners of war\nand missing Kuwaiti and third-country citizens. In that\nregard, we urge the Iraqi Government to cooperate with\nthe Tripartite Commission and the International\nCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to deal with this\nhumanitarian issue.\nMy Government is confident that the Iraqi file\ncannot be closed without continuous diplomatic efforts\nby all, through United Nations channels and in any\nother political way available. We thus find no\njustification for any military operation against Iraq. We\ntherefore welcome the statement made by President\nGeorge W. Bush of the United States at the outset of\nthe general debate, in which he spoke of addressing the\nIraqi crisis through the Security Council.\nMy Government follows with great interest and\noptimism the official contacts maintained between the\nUnited Arab Emirates and the Islamic Republic of Iran\nregarding the dispute on the three islands belonging to\nthe Emirates, Abu Musa, Greater Tunb and Lesser\nTunb. We hope that these contacts and negotiations will\nlead to an agreement on an effective mechanism for the\nsettlement of this issue.\nMy country, along with other countries in the\nregion, is interested in the establishment of security\nand stability in the Indian subcontinent. In that regard,\nwe place high value on international efforts to contain\nthe conflict between India and Pakistan, and we urge\nthose countries to benefit from international diplomacy\nto agree on an effective mechanism leading to a\npeaceful and final settlement of the Kashmir dispute.\nRegarding Afghanistan, we welcome the return of\nthat country to the international family, and we look\nforward to the establishment of security and stability in\nits territory under the supervision of a Government\nreflecting the aspirations of all parties in Afghanistan.\nMy Government values international efforts to assist\nthe Afghan Government and the international\ncommunity's ongoing financial and technical assistance\nfor rebuilding the country and providing for the basic\nneeds of the Afghan people after so many years of\nsuffering and war.\nMy country condemns all forms of terrorism. In\nline with the purposes of the United Nations in the\nmaintenance of international peace and security, we\nreaffirm our support for international efforts to fight\nterrorism and our commitment to the relevant\ninternational resolutions, including Security Council\nresolution 1373 (2001), and all relevant Islamic, Arab\nand international treaties and agreements to which my\ncountry has acceded. My delegation expresses its\nreadiness to cooperate with the United Nations in\nfighting international terrorism, in accordance with the\nprinciples of international law and the principle of\nnational sovereignty, and taking into account the need\nto distinguish between terrorism and legitimate\nresistance against occupation. The Sultanate of Oman\nsupports the call for the convening under United\nNations auspices of an international conference on\nterrorism in order to agree on a clear international\ndefinition of terrorism and to set up a mechanism to\naddress and eradicate terrorism.\nMy country deeply believes that the accession\nand commitment of States to treaties and conventions\non disarmament will strengthen and preserve peace and\nsecurity on the regional and international levels.\nConsequently, the signature of the Sultanate of Oman\nremains on the record as a State party to such treaties.\nBased on that principle, we emphasize the need to\ntake practical measures to make the Middle East a\nregion free from all weapons of mass destruction. In\nthat connection, we request Israel to join all relevant\ntreaties, beginning with the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and to subject\nits nuclear facilities to the safeguards inspection regime\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency. That\nwould create a positive climate and put an end to arms\nproliferation in the region.\nMy country calls on the United Nations to\ncontinue its broad-based efforts to rid the world\ncompletely of all types of weapons of mass destruction.\nWe urge nuclear-weapon States in particular to\nformulate time-bound programmes to achieve that goal\nas soon as possible. In that regard, my Government\ncommends the United States and the Russian\nFederation for having reached an agreement on the\nreduction of their nuclear arsenals.\n24\n\nMy country is currently presiding over the Gulf\nCooperation Council (GCC), and hosted the twenty-\nsecond session of the Supreme Council of the GCC,\nheld in December 2001 in Muscat. That summit\nresulted in the adoption of many decisions and\nresolutions and other achievements, including the\nsigning of an economic agreement among member\nStates and an agreement on a standardized customs\nduty of 5 per cent on all imported goods. That\nagreement will take effect when a customs union\namong member States comes into force at the\nbeginning of next year. The Council also took a\ndecision on a unified Gulf currency. That will enhance\neconomic structures, facilitate differential trade and\nincrease the Gulf's competitiveness with other regional\neconomic groups, in addition to promoting the labour\nmarket and the private sector in our countries. It will\nalso attract more investors and commercial\npartnerships within the great Arab region, with other\nfriendly States, and in world markets.\nAmong the prominent results of the Muscat\nsummit was our leaders' decision to invite the Republic\nof Yemen to join a number of Gulf joint\nestablishments. That decision was taken based on the\nmutual desire and deep belief of both parties that the\nincorporation of Yemen into the GCC in a gradual and\ncalculated manner will conform to the economic and\nsocial needs and development circumstances of Yemen\nand will serve the common interests of the region.\nWe are working to preserve the environment. We\nhave a strong record of achievements and measures\ntaken by our Government to plan national\nenvironmental protection strategies. However, it is no\nsecret that many obstacles threaten our environment\ninternally, regionally and internationally. Among the\nchallenges is the lack of sufficient water to cope with\npopulation growth, which will endanger our population\nand will increase the risk of desertification, making it\nnecessary that we intensify scientific research and\nallocate the resources necessary for that purpose.\nWe are happy to have participated in the\nJohannesburg World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment, and we wish to emphasize our interest in\nthe outcome documents adopted at the conference. We\nalso take this opportunity to emphasize the need to\nrespect United Nations resolutions and decisions as\nwell as the Charter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffMongolia\nwelcomes wholeheartedly the newest member of the\nUnited Nations family, Switzerland, a country that has\na long-standing association with the United Nations as\nits second largest headquarters. We also look forward\nto welcoming East Timor, the youngest member of the\ninternational community.\nA little over two years ago, at the historic\nMillennium Summit held here in New York, our leaders\nreaffirmed their commitment to the purposes and\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter and pledged\ntheir unequivocal support for a more efficient and\nreinvigorated United Nations so that this unique world\nbody can effectively address the formidable challenges\nof the new century and, indeed, of the new millennium.\nSome important steps have been taken to reform\nand adapt the United Nations to the evolving\ninternational realities, with a view to ensuring its\nefficient functioning in the era of globalization.\nHowever, the reform process, particularly that of the\nSecurity Council, tends to slow down and hence, there\nis an apparent need to take proper measures to speed it\nup. Mongolia stands for a just and equitable\nenlargement of the Security Council and for\ndemocratization of international relations by enhancing\nthe openness and transparency of the work of the\nSecurity Council and by increasing the role of the\nGeneral Assembly, as envisaged in the Charter of the\nUnited Nations.\nThe United Nations has been instrumental in\nintensifying the efforts of the world community aimed\nat developing a collective response to global terror, at\nhelping reach national reconciliation and build a peace\n23\n\nprocess in post-Taliban Afghanistan, at assisting in the\nemergence of an independent East Timor and at helping\nto bring about the entry into force of the Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court. It has also been\nindispensable in paving the way towards reaching\nconsensus at Doha, Monterrey, Rome and\nJohannesburg, which were important steps along the\nroad towards meeting the millennium development\ngoals.\nYet, much still remains to be done to sustain the\nprogress achieved, to honour commitments made and\nto redress setbacks to international peace and security\nin today's volatile environment. The tragic events of 11\nSeptember have shown that there is a need for a\nfundamental change in our perception of security. More\nweapons and allocating more resources to the military\ndo not necessarily translate into increased security.\nSecurity can no longer be confined to the boundaries of\na single State, or even a group of States. This\nindivisibility of global security makes multilateralism\nthe order of the day. To paraphrase the Secretary-\nGeneral, let us all recognize that today global security\nis our national security. Let us also recognize that\nensuring the security of the human person must be at\nthe heart of our concerns. The concept of human\nsecurity is increasingly making a case for itself.\nThe outgoing year has witnessed serious threats\nto international peace and security. The remnants of\nthose threats continue to pose a menace to the\ninternational community.\nIn Afghanistan, the United Nations is helping the\nAfghan Government in its efforts towards\nrehabilitation, reconstruction and development. Those\nobjectives can only be achieved if the Government of\nPresident Karzai exercises effective control over the\nentire country.\nThe prevailing explosive situation in the Middle\nEast is of special concern. It calls for sustained efforts\naimed at reaching a just and comprehensive solution to\nthe problem. Mongolia supports the efforts of the\nQuartet and of the countries of the region to find ways\nto peacefully settle that long-festering conflict. The\nconvening of an international conference to consider\neffective measures for such a solution will undoubtedly\nbe a step in the right direction.\nMy Government shares the view that the Security\nCouncil should make every effort to impress upon Iraq\nthe need to comply with Council resolutions and, as a\nfirst step, accept weapons inspections unconditionally.\nThe world community cannot afford to sit idle in the\nface of open defiance of mandatory resolutions of the\nSecurity Council.\nThe world has not only been threatened by the\nescalation of tension in various regions, it has also\nbeen threatened by increasing human insecurity\nresulting from the failure of the international\ncommunity to deliver on the crucial commitments it\nmade during the 1990s. In his address to the General\nAssembly last year, my Prime Minister appealed to the\ninternational community to make the first decade of\nthis new century a decade of implementation and\ncooperation towards a safer and better world, as we\ncannot afford to fail during yet another decade if we\nare serious about ensuring human security. We cannot\nafford to fail to implement the far-reaching, yet\nachievable, targets set by our leaders at the Millennium\nSummit. That is all the more so as our failure or\ninaction could be used as justification for deadly acts\nby those who threaten peace, stability and social\nprogress.\nThat appeal is even more relevant today. The\n2002 Human Development Report indicates that if\ncurrent trends continue, a significant portion of the\nworld's States are unlikely to achieve the millennium\ndevelopment goals, including the overarching target of\nhalving extreme poverty by 2015. If global progress\ncontinues at such a snail's pace, it will take more than\n130 years to rid the world of hunger.\nA legitimate question arises, namely what has to\nbe done by the international community to redress that\nsituation? The short answer could be to display genuine\nsolidarity and for all to share responsibility in\nhonouring the commitments made without delay. But\nthe people of our countries, in whose service this world\nbody was conceived, have waited through dozens of\nconferences and their five-year reviews while the\nimplementation of agreed targets continues to be\nstalled at levels far from those desired. Under these\ncircumstances it is our considered view that it is\nincumbent upon the international community to closely\nlook into the existing imbalance in global governance,\nespecially in the economic and social areas.\nMongolia believes that with its impartiality and\nuniversal legitimacy, as well as its Charter-based\nprevalence over any other international agreement, the\nUnited Nations is uniquely placed to provide for global\n24\n\ngovernance in economic and social areas while\nallowing equal participation by the South in the\ndecision-making process. We therefore believe that it is\nhigh time to engage in an earnest dialogue about an\nentirely new framework of development cooperation\nthat is more responsive to the emerging imperatives of\nglobal human security.\nAs we see it, the new development partnership\nbetween the North and the South should be based on\njustice, not on charity; on equitable sharing of global\nmarket opportunities, not on protectionism or aid; and\non mutual cooperation, not on unilateral conditionality\nor confrontation. The Economic and Social Council has\nan important role to play in initiating and promoting\nthat dialogue, in line with the objectives set forth in\nArticle 55 of the Charter.\nFurthermore, transnational organized crime, illicit\ndrugs, money-laundering, the illegal arms trade, the\nspread of HIV/AIDS, global pollution, climate change\nand other negative phenomena pose a persistent threat\nto rich and poor nations alike. They call for a new\ncooperation framework to be developed to defend the\nnew frontiers of global human security and to fill\ncritical gaps in the existing system of global economic\ngovernance. At a time of increasing globalization, the\nformidable challenges facing the human family require\nan adequate response. It would be a fallacy to replace\nfundamental reform with a piecemeal approach or\nmarginal remedies. If there is strong political will on\nthe part of the international community to collectively\nstand up to these challenges, then why not engage in a\ncommon quest for an adequate architecture of global\ngovernance for human security?\nMongolia expresses its firm support for the\ncreation of the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment (NEPAD). NEPAD is a comprehensive\nblueprint and a broad vision for Africa's future\neconomic and social development. It is Africa-owned,\nand based on the lessons of the past decade. We hope\nthat that important initiative will receive the generous\nsupport of the international community with a view to\nattaining the ambitious goal of an African renaissance.\nMy own country, Mongolia, which has the\ninherent development handicap of being landlocked\nand is very susceptible to natural disasters, is not\nimmune from many of the threats to human security to\nwhich I have referred. In addition to the persistence of\npoverty and unemployment and the disruption of basic\nhealth and social services, human security in Mongolia\nis affected by the increasing recurrence of natural\ndisasters and the spread of environmental degradation,\nincluding desertification, water and air pollution.\nEfforts to improve human security are further\nhampered by extremely low population density, a weak\ninfrastructure and a small, non-diversified economy\nthat is very vulnerable to external shocks.\nCapitalizing on its valuable assets of well-\neducated human resources and accumulated experience\nof reform in both the political and economic areas,\nMongolia is endeavouring to ensure the human security\nof its people through both national action and\ninternational cooperation.\nNationally, my Government launched, in late\n2000, the Good Governance for Human Security\nprogramme, aimed at improving the capacity to\nformulate and implement policies to ensure human\nsecurity. Thus far, we have succeeded in securing a\nnational commitment to its implementation on the part\nof all the branches of the State; institutionalizing the\nprogramme's implementation mechanism; and laying\nthe groundwork for the greater involvement and\nparticipation of civil society, the private sector and\nacademia.\nAt the international level, Mongolia, for its part,\nhas been endeavouring to contribute, where it can, to\nthe common efforts of the world community, while\ndrawing attention to issues of particular concern to it.\nAs a landlocked developing country, Mongolia\nattaches particular importance to enhancing\ninternational cooperation to ease the inherent\ndevelopment challenges faced by that group of\ncountries. In this regard, my delegation looks forward\nto the forthcoming International Ministerial Meeting on\ntransit transport cooperation, to be held in 2003 in\nKazakhstan.\nIn recognition of the crucial role of education in\nensuring sustainable human development and human\nsecurity, my delegation is pleased to note that at its last\nsession the General Assembly proclaimed \u2014 as the\nresult of an initiative of Mongolia \u2014 the 10-year\nperiod starting 1 January 2003 as the United Nations\nLiteracy Decade. We look forward to the unanimous\nadoption of the Decade's draft plan of action at this\nsession of the General Assembly.\n25\n\nTen years ago Mongolia declared itself a nuclear-\nweapon-free zone. Since then, it has adopted national\nlegislation defining and regulating that status. At\npresent, consultations are under way with our\nimmediate neighbours and other States concerned on\nways to institutionalize our status internationally. I\nwould like to take this opportunity to thank the five\nnuclear-weapon States for their cooperation, and\nUnited Nations bodies for their invaluable support in\ntranslating the initiative into reality.\nIn recent years, Mongolia has been actively\nengaged in establishing and strengthening institutions\nand processes of democratic governance, protecting\nhuman rights and promoting democratic consolidation.\nIts efforts have been similar to those of many other\nStates that are promoting democratic values and\ndeveloping democratic institutions. We believe that the\nFifth International Conference of New or Restored\nDemocracies, to be held from 18 to 20 June 2003 in\nMongolia, could provide an important opportunity for\nthe international community to exchange information\nand experience and search for practical ways of\npromoting and strengthening democracy nationally and\ninternationally. I would like to take this opportunity to\nexpress my Government's heartfelt gratitude to this\nbody for graciously accepting our offer and setting in\nmotion the preparations for the Conference. The main\ntheme of the Conference is democracy, good\ngovernance and civil society.\nMongolia believes that the International Criminal\nCourt, established on 1 July, could be instrumental in\nending impunity and upholding justice, deterring future\ncrimes and further strengthening international criminal\nlaw. As one of its founding members, Mongolia also\nbelieves that the widest possible accession to the Court\nwill broaden the geographic scope of the Court's\njurisdiction and thus end impunity for acts of genocide,\nwar crimes and crimes against humanity. The Court's\njurisdiction should eventually cover the crime of\naggression.\nIn conclusion, may I reiterate my Government's\nresolve to work with other Member States towards\nmaking our world Organization better equipped to meet\nthe global challenges lying ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate you, Sir, on\nyour election to the presidency of the General\nAssembly. I thank your predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-\nsoo, for the leadership he displayed at a particularly\ncritical moment for the Organization.\nTo Secretary-General Kofi Annan, I reaffirm\nBrazil\u2019s confidence in his statesmanship.\nI have the pleasure of greeting the entry of East\nTimor into the fold of the United Nations, just as we\nwelcomed it last July in Brasilia into our Community\nof Portuguese-Speaking Countries. A free Timor is a\nremarkable United Nations success story.\nBrazil also welcomes Switzerland, as it has now\nbecome a full member of this global political forum.\nI come to this Hall as the representative of a\ncountry that has faith in the United Nations and that\nviews multilateralism as the guiding principle of\nrelations among States. This is a conviction we hold\ndear at all times, good and bad. We are at a particularly\n\ndifficult juncture for the Organization. This moment\ncalls for measures sustained by the principles and\nvalues on which the United Nations was founded.\nBrazil has defended them since the first international\nconferences of the twentieth century.\nWe have never let ourselves be tempted by the\nargument of power. Rather, we have been guided by the\npower of argument. This has been the foreign policy of\nPresident Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Throughout the\neight years of the two terms of office to which he has\nbeen democratically elected, certain fundamental\nguidelines have been recurrent: fostering democratic\ndecision-making; overcoming the governance deficit in\ninternational relations; designing a new financial\narchitecture and providing effective solutions for\nvolatility in capital flows; defending a multilateral\ntrade regime that is both fair and balanced \u2014 hence,\nthe importance of the World Trade Organization and of\nthe Doha mandate; correcting the distortions resulting\nfrom economic globalization that is not accompanied\nby a corresponding process of political and institutional\nglobalization; and affirming the value of human rights\nand sustainable development. These are challenges that\nwe cannot face alone.\nFor this reason, President Fernando Henrique\nCardoso has sought to strengthen the Common Market\nof the South, together with South American integration,\nas instruments for peace, cooperation and greater\ncompetitiveness among our countries. Similarly,\nPresident Cardoso has promoted the development of\npartnerships in all continents, pursuing well-balanced\nnegotiations for the establishment of free trade areas, in\nparticular with the European Union, as well as with the\ncountries taking part in the Free Trade Area of the\nAmericas process.\nWe are committed to seeing the entry into force\nof the Kyoto Protocol and the establishment of the\nInternational Criminal Court; to furthering the social\ndevelopment agenda; and to moving forward on\nnuclear and conventional disarmament. The Brazilian\nvision of the world under the leadership of President\nFernando Henrique Cardoso expresses goals not just of\nGovernment, but also of the entire country and society.\nThat is why the electoral process now under way will\nfurther strengthen democracy in Brazil and highlight\nthe country\u2019s international credentials.\nOur commitment to the United Nations and to\nmultilateralism will not waver \u201cin times of storm and\nblustery winds\u201d, to quote Cam\u00f5es, the great poet of the\nPortuguese language. The greater the challenges, such\nas those facing us at this difficult juncture, the greater\nthe need for answers grounded in legitimacy \u2014\nlegitimacy born of participation and consensus.\nCooperation must be our modus operandi.\nIn the multilateral sphere, leadership is crucial to\nthe tasks before us. We are clearly aware of that, yet\nthe form and content of each task must be defined\nthrough dialogue. Only through dialogue will a\ncoalition of truly united nations be built \u2014 nations\nunited by the power of persuasion. The tangled\ninterests that form a global web of interdependence can\nbe managed only through authority rooted in\nmultilateral institutions and in respect for international\nlaw. The commitment to negotiated settlements, under\nthe aegis of multilateralism, must be upheld.\nAt the time of the 11 September terrorist attacks,\nthis Organization immediately showed its solidarity\nwith the United States of America by adopting\nresolutions of the General Assembly and the Security\nCouncil. At the regional level, the Inter-American\nTreaty of Reciprocal Assistance was invoked on a\nBrazilian initiative as an expression of our firm\nrepudiation and condemnation of all barbaric acts of\nterrorism and of our solidarity with the United States.\nThese responses have taken the form of renewed\ncollaboration in security, intelligence, police and\njudicial cooperation issues.\nLasting solutions to terrorism, international drug-\ntrafficking and organized crime require careful and\npersistent efforts to set up partnerships and cooperative\narrangements consistent with the United Nations\nmultilateral system.\nMany countries and regions have been burdened\nwith the costs of globalization, while at the same time\nbeing deprived of its benefits. The very same free flow\nof capital that can foster investment is responsible for\nspeculative attacks against national currencies and\nbalance of payment crises, with negative impact on the\ncontinuity of public policies and on the alleviation of\nsocial ills.\nProtectionism and all forms of barriers to trade,\nboth tariff and non-tariff, continue to suffocate\ndeveloping economies and to nullify the\ncompetitiveness of their exports. Liberalization of the\nagricultural sector has been nothing more than a\npromise repeatedly put off to an uncertain future.\n5\nA/57/PV.2\nThe globalization to which we aspire requires\nreform of economic and financial institutions. It must\nnot be limited to the triumph of the market.\nA modern understanding of development must\nencompass the protection of human rights, be they civil\nand political or economic, social and cultural. In this\nrespect, the appointment of Sergio Vieira de Mello as\nthe new United Nations High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights is a great honour for all Brazilians. He\nsucceeds Mary Robinson, whose important\nachievements deserve recognition.\nThe United Nations was created to maintain\npeace and security. However, armed conflicts and\npockets of irrational violence persist today.\nThe situation in the Middle East underscores how\ndistant we still are from the international order\nimagined by the founders of the United Nations\nCharter.\nBrazil supports the creation of a democratic,\nsecure and economically viable Palestinian State, as\nwell as the right of the Palestinian people to self-\ndetermination. Brazil defends the right of the State of\nIsrael to exist within recognized borders and of its\npeople to live in security. These are essential\nprerequisites for lasting peace in the Middle East. Only\nby mutually and comprehensively acknowledging the\nconflicting legitimacies in the region, as well as by\nbuilding on existing agreements, can we staunch the\nindiscriminate destructiveness of violence and forge a\nway forward.\nThe use of force at the international level is\nadmissible only once all diplomatic alternatives have\nbeen exhausted. Force must be exercised only in\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations and\nin a manner consistent with the determinations of the\nSecurity Council. Otherwise, the credibility of the\nOrganization will be undermined in a way that will not\nonly be illegitimate, but that will also give rise to\nsituations of precarious and short-lived stability.\nIn the specific case of Iraq, Brazil believes that it\nis incumbent upon the Security Council to determine\nthe measures necessary to ensure full compliance with\nrelevant resolutions. The Security Council\u2019s exercise of\nits responsibilities is the way to reduce tensions and to\navoid risking the unpredictable consequences resulting\nfrom wider instability.\nIn Angola the international community must\nsupport recent positive developments that open the way\nto the rebuilding of the country and the consolidation\nof peace and democracy.\nStrengthening the system of collective security\nremains a challenge. The Security Council needs\nreform in order to enhance its legitimacy and lay the\nfoundations for more solid international cooperation in\nbuilding a just and stable international order. A central\nfeature of this reform should be the expansion of the\nnumber of members, both in the permanent and non-\npermanent categories.\nBrazil has already made it known \u2014 and I\nreaffirm it here \u2014 that it is ready to contribute to the\nwork of the Security Council and to assume all its\nresponsibilities.\nFor Brazil, the United Nations is the public space\nfor the creation of power, which, according to Hannah\nArendt, can result only from the human capacity to act\nin concert. The United Nations is the crucial hinge in\ncreating a global governance focused on more\nequitable distribution of the dividends of peace and\nprogress.\nTherein lies our vision for the future, a vision of\nsolidarity among peoples and nations, a vision made\nlegitimate by renewed and inclusive understanding of\npower.\nWe are inspired by the observation of\nGuicciardini, the politically more successful Florentine\ncontemporary of Machiavelli: \u201cAmong men, hope is\nnormally more powerful than fear\u201d."

        "file_text": "\ufeffI wish to extend our\ncongratulations to Mr. Jan Kavan on his election to\nlead the work of the General Assembly. We are\nconfident that his leadership will bring greater honour\nto the United Nations, to his country and to himself.\nWe would also like to congratulate his predecessor, Mr.\n14\n\nHan Seung-soo, for his excellent work during the\nprevious session.\nWe would also like to express our solidarity with\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan in his defence of the\nwill of the many in the face of any event that places\nworld peace at risk.\nWe also wish to welcome the Swiss\nConfederation and East Timor as they take their places\nin the Organization.\nOn behalf of the people and the Government of\nthe Dominican Republic, I would like once again to\nreiterate the profound faith that the Dominican people\nhave in the principles on which the universal mission\nof the United Nations is based. The ideas and\nambitions that sparked the Second World War brought\nhumanity close to losing all hope for peaceful co-\nexistence. Political fanaticism, intransigent nationalism\nand all sorts of prejudices cast their shadow over\nleaders and over a great part of the world, leading to an\nominous undertaking whose ideological manifestation\ngreatly endangered the freedom and cultural diversity\nof humankind.\nLuckily for all, reason prevailed. In order to make\nthat victory a lasting one, and in order to ensure that\nhumankind would maintain a steady and clear path\ntowards peace, the nations who fought for freedom\nrecognized the need to create a body to watch over the\nvalues that would improve international behaviour.\nThese were the reasons for both the emergence of the\nUnited Nations and for enshrining in the Charter the\nobjectives of peace, justice, the rejection of aggression\nand the resolution of controversies through peaceful\nmeans and in accordance with international law.\nIn other words, it was very clearly set out that the\nOrganization would seek to use every peaceful means\nto resolve conflicts between peoples or States. It was\nalso clearly specified that the use of force to maintain\nor restore peace and international security had to be the\nresult of a unanimous decision of the permanent\nmembers of the Security Council. Over five decades\nhave passed since the establishment of the\nOrganization, and the events and changes experienced\nby the world in that time have been innumerable.\nMany bloody conflicts in the Middle East, Asia\nand Africa have challenged the authority of the United\nNations. Many unilateral actions have violated the\nOrganization's legal system and threatened the balance\nof the world. Nevertheless, despite every provocation\nand all the instances of non-compliance with the\nresolutions of its highest bodies, the Organization has\nclearly made its mark by asserting the need to respect\nthe international norms and laws governing the\nbehaviour of its members. Peace, and even the survival\nof mankind itself, owe a great deal to the achievements\nof the United Nations.\nUnfortunately, threats to universal peace continue\nto cast their shadow over the world today. The date of\n11 September 2001 is an alarming example of the\nscope and capability of the enemies of peace. We will\nnever be able to forget the perversity of those actions,\ntheir criminal character or the affront they tried to\ninflict upon this great nation. We understand perfectly\nwell that, in the face of an aggression of this nature, the\nspontaneous reaction may be that of claiming\nlegitimate self-defence. However, we should agree that\nsuch a response has moral limitations and conditions\nembodied in the principles that rule the rights of people\nand in those that form the bedrock of this Organization.\nThe Dominican Government has been signing all\nresolutions, agreements and conventions against\nterrorism. The Dominican Government has supported\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001), which created\nthe Counter-Terrorism Committee, and is promoting\nthe work to draft a comprehensive convention against\ninternational terrorism. However, our purpose in\nfighting this scourge and our solidarity with the nations\nthat have been and are its victims must be focused,\nbeyond any contingency, on the eradication of the\ncauses that stimulate and provoke the depravation of\nthe human condition that is expressed in acts of terror.\nWith regard to the right to confront terrorism\ndirectly, we must be aware that unilateral action\nrepresents a defeat of our capacity to reach agreements.\nIt is only logical that it is our responsibility to do so\nwith all the authority that this Organization grants\nthrough its multilateral nature. This is true because the\nuse of force can be justified only when all means under\nthe Charter of United Nations available to the General\nAssembly and the Security Council to assess the existence\nof a real threat to world peace have been exhausted.\nIn his report of 13 April 1998 concerning the\nissue of peace in Africa, the Secretary-General set forth\nideas which must serve as a guide on the Iraqi\nsituation. Among other ideas, Kofi Annan stated:\n15\n\n\u201cFor the United Nations there is no higher\ngoal, no deeper commitment and no greater\nambition than preventing armed conflict. The\nprevention of conflict begins and ends with the\npromotion of human security and human\ndevelopment.\u201d (A/52/871, para. 2)\nIt is obvious that we are not the only ones to think\nthat, in the face of market globalization processes, cultural\nexchanges, technologies and communications, it has\nbecome imperative to resume on the path laid down at\nthe Millennium Summit in order to correct the imbalances\nand to halt the growing total marginalization of large\nsectors of the world population. Allow me to quote a\nparagraph from the Millennium Declaration as a\nreminder of our priorities:\n\u201cWe believe that the central challenge we\nface today is to ensure that globalization becomes\na positive force for all the world's people. For\nwhile globalization offers great opportunities, at\npresent its benefits are very unevenly shared,\nwhile its costs are unevenly distributed. We\nrecognize that developing countries and countries\nwith economies in transition face special\ndifficulties in responding to this central\nchallenge.\u201d (resolution 55/2, para. 5)\nMoreover, the Millennium Summit prioritized\nissues such as poverty, illiteracy, illness, gender\ninequality and environmental depletion as causes that\nconspire decisively against peace and universal\ncoexistence. These troubling situations beg the\nquestion: How much have we done at the national and\ninternational levels to eliminate the obstacles that\nhinder the growth of the developing countries?\nRight from its assumption of power in August\n2000, the Government of the Dominican Republic,\nheaded by agronomist Hip\u00f3lito Mej'a, has taken a\nseries of measures aimed at adapting legislation in both\npublic and private institutions to the demands of the\nunavoidable globalization process. With respect to\nsocial reform, the Dominican Government has\nlaunched a programme to reduce poverty and has\nincreased its support in the fight against illiteracy. The\ncreation of ministries of women and the environment\nare also significant initiatives in view of the lack of\nattention from which these sectors of society\ntraditionally suffered.\nWe know that other countries have made similar\nchanges, but the truth of the matter is that, as a whole,\nglobal statistics leave little room for optimism when\ncompared to those relating to the great majority of\ndeveloping countries. Unfortunately, at the global\nlevel, we cannot say that developed countries have\nmanifested any understanding of or solidarity towards\nthese issues in positive terms. The opportunities\noffered by the developed countries for developing\ncountries to participate in the globalization process\nthrough cooperation leading to harmonious, gradual\nand equitable adaptation leave much to be desired.\nWithin this sombre picture, the United Nations has\nto act decisively in favour of the development of nations\nunjustifiably constrained by protectionism and subsidies,\nwhich create barriers that hinder competition on equal\nterms and which, consequently, negate free trade.\nYear after year, speaker after speaker, we speak in\nthis solemn Hall about the mandate \u2014 also ratified at\nthe Millennium Summit \u2014 to proceed with decisive\nreforms in the Security Council and the General\nAssembly. However, a sort of indifference or adverse\npurport postpones or paralyses the opportunity to\nactually undertake such reform. If the universal\nconscience is to enjoy genuine representation, the\nreform of such bodies is imperative. Thus, this\nOrganization needs its multilateral role to become the\ntrue expression of the political composition acquired\nby the world over the past 57 years.\nOn behalf of the Dominican Government, we\nwish to express our satisfaction for the decision taken\nby the Organization of American States regarding\nHaiti. Indeed, through its resolution 822 of 4\nSeptember 2002, entitled \u201cSupport for strengthening\ndemocracy in Haiti\u201d, that regional organization decided\nto support the regularization of economic cooperation\nbetween the Haitian Government and international\nfinancial institutions. Following the instructions of the\nPresident of the Dominican Republic, we appeal to the\nconscience of the United Nations to proceed in the\nsame manner and to extend its support in reaching\nthose nations capable of generous cooperation with our\nsister nation.\nI wish to take this opportunity to share the most\nrecent decisions concerning the International Research\nand Training Institute for the Advancement of Women,\nheadquartered in the Dominican Republic, which is one of\nthe few United Nations bodies located in a developing\ncountry and the only one working on women's research\nand training. On 19 December 2001, by resolution\n16\n\n56/125, the General Assembly decided to create a\nworking group with the mandate to make\nrecommendations on the future work of the Institute. That\nworking group met eight times in July and August 2002.\nThe Dominican Republic is confident that this session\nof the General Assembly will accept the working\ngroup's recommendations and that the Institute will\nsoon be able to continue to fulfil its mandate.\nIn conclusion, I must recall that, at the beginning\nof my statement, I reaffirmed the faith of the Dominican\npeople and Government in the mission of the United\nNations. This Organization is more necessary today than\never before, at a time when the world is shrinking and\nwhen we increasingly need more than one interlocutor\nto which we can turn when faced with issues that could\nprovoke violence and war. In other words, today more\nthan ever all nations aspire to having an Organization\nthat, through its traditional mandate and its universal\nscope, can strike a balance among all States for the\nbenefit of genuine democratic security.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, I wish to\nextend to Mr. Jan Kavan congratulations on his election\nas President of the fifty-seventh session of the United\nNations General Assembly. I also wish to take this\nopportunity to commend his predecessor for his\ninvaluable contribution to what was achieved at the\nfifty-sixth session of the General Assembly. Allow me\nalso to express our appreciation to our Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan, for the effort he has been\nmaking to ensure that the United Nations becomes a\nmore effective instrument for tackling the very many\nchallenges faced by the international community.\nMy delegation would like to join others in\nwelcoming the admission of the Swiss Confederation\nto the United Nations. It is a country that has, indeed,\ncontributed so much to the Organization over the years.\nOur continent, Africa, and its peoples, continue to\nface enormous and daunting challenges. This is not\nnew. This is something that has been going on for the\nlast few decades, with the general economic and social\nsituation in the continent deteriorating even further.\nThe general trend has been one of an ever-faster\nmarginalization of Africa. The continent has yet to see\nthe benefits of globalization. Africa still awaits the\ncreation of an enabling international economic context\nfor progress in its efforts to wage war against poverty.\nThat effort is unlikely to succeed without greater\ninternational cooperation. Many in Africa, including\nmy own country, Ethiopia, are unlikely to meet the\ninternationally agreed poverty-related targets and\ngoals, including those set by the United Nations\nMillennium Declaration, without greater readiness on\nthe part of the international community to contribute\nmore to Africa's fight against poverty.\nThe eradication of poverty is not only Africa's\nchallenge or only that of the developing world. As was\nreiterated at the Johannesburg World Summit on\nSustainable Development, poverty is the greatest global\nchallenge facing the world. The despair and\nhopelessness engendered by poverty have implications\nfor the world in general \u2014 not only for the people of\nthe South but for those of the North, as well.\nMany might have felt that the Johannesburg\nSummit failed to rise to the occasion and that its\nachievement was not commensurate with the gravity of\nthe challenges faced by the peoples of the world in a\nvariety of areas, most of all, in areas most relevant to\nthe eradication of poverty. But there was one thing\nwhich was unambiguously evident at the Johannesburg\nSummit. Those from both the North and the South\nstressed with one voice that the global apartheid we\ncurrently have is unsustainable. How can one\nimplement that vision? This is what continues to elude\nthe international community. It remains the case\ndespite some progress that has been made, including at\nMonterrey.\nThe eradication of poverty in Africa, and in my\nown country, is not primarily the responsibility of the\ninternational community. It is primarily our\nresponsibility to put our houses in order and to take the\nlead in rejuvenating Africa.\nThat is where in fact today there is a new\ndevelopment in Africa. Many in Africa are more\nprepared than ever before to take charge of their\ndestiny. There is a new thinking in Africa today and a\nrealistic resolve to ensure the regeneration of the\ncontinent. I am referring to the New Partnership for\nAfrica's Development (NEPAD). It is an initiative by\nAfrica which demonstrates the readiness of the\ncontinent to take charge of its future. It is a concrete\n18\n\ncommitment by Africa to take the necessary steps in\nboth the economic and political areas towards creating\nenabling conditions for economic and social\ntransformation. It is a realistic initiative that specifies\nand underlines the obligation of African countries in all\nareas relevant to the creation of conditions conducive\nto economic and social development. Good governance\nis one such vital obligation to which the initiative\naccords the necessary importance. It is a major step for\nAfrica and one whose significance should be\nunderlined. The commitment to democracy and good\ngovernance has major implications for Africa not only\nin economic development but also in creating\nconditions for nurturing peace and stability.\nNonetheless, NEPAD cannot succeed without the\ncooperation of Africa's partners and the international\ncommunity. And succeed it must, not only because\nNEPAD's success is in the vital interest of Africa but\nalso because it is in the interest of the world in general.\nThe logic of globalization makes it obvious that no part\nof the globe is immune to the negative influences\nemanating from its other, less fortunate parts.\nRealistically speaking, we swim or sink together. It\nwould be unwise to believe that the growing\nmarginalization and decay of Africa will have no\nsignificant adverse implications for the stability and\nviability of the globalizing world. It is this common\ninterest that we all share which is the basis for our\nmutual obligation for the success of NEPAD. I must\nstate here that we have been encouraged by the\npreliminary response to NEPAD by many members of\nthe international community, including the G-8\ncountries and others. We are still hopeful that even\ngreater support and enthusiasm will be demonstrated\nby the international community to ensure that NEPAD\nwill be workable.\nEthiopia subscribes fully to the NEPAD\nframework. We are indeed at present in the process of\nimplementing the principles and ideas promoted by the\ninitiative. We will continue to be committed to carrying\nout our obligations for good governance, for creating\nenabling conditions for economic development and for\neradicating poverty.\nAll the efforts we are making to ensure success in\nthe fight against poverty are bound to fail without\npeace and durable stability. Here as well, Africa,\nincluding our subregion, the Horn of Africa, requires\nthe effective support of the international community.\nWhat we need is enlightened support which is\ntransparent and targeted at ensuring durable peace and\nstability. What we require is support not compromised\nby tactical considerations which are short-sighted and\nlikely to aggravate already existing problems. Coddling\nunaccountable Governments would not promote peace\nin the long run and would not bring about durable\nstability.\nOurs is a region which has suffered so much,\namong other things because of strategic considerations\nwhich made expedient the propping up of\nunaccountable and authoritarian regimes. The result of\nall that has been disastrous for the region. Peace and\nstability in the Horn of Africa, as is true in all parts of\nthe world, is dependent in a critical manner on the\ncreation of conditions for good governance. This is a\nvalue which ought to be universally applied, including\nin our subregion. Durable peace demands it. The\nwelfare of the people of our subregion makes it\nimperative.\nEthiopia will leave no stone unturned for peace in\nour subregion and in Africa as a whole. The effort we\nhave been making for peace in Somalia within the\nframework of the Intergovernmental Authority on\nDevelopment is being made in that spirit. It is also in\nthat same spirit that we shall continue to do our share\nfor peace and national reconciliation in the Sudan.\nMost of all, we draw satisfaction from the fact that we\nhave managed to come out of a war that was imposed\non us. For our part, we are determined to leave behind\nthe crisis we had with Eritrea. We shall remain\ncommitted to the peace process until its conclusion.\nIt has always been our conviction that it is in the\nvital interest of Ethiopia to nurture peace in our\nsubregion. That is required by the war we have to wage\nagainst poverty, which is the only real enemy we have.\nBut the promotion of the cause of peace in the Horn of\nAfrica has not been that easy. Our subregion is an area\nof the world that has long been vulnerable to terrorist\nactivities. Ours has been an area that, due in part to the\nprevalence of poverty, has been taken advantage of\nvery recklessly. My own country has been among those\nto have suffered as a result. This is a challenge that we\nstill have to contend with, and which we still continue\nto face. This first-hand experience of ours put us in a\nposition where we can deeply share the anguish of the\npeople of the United States over the 11 September\nterrorist attack, which we have condemned vehemently.\nAs we mark the first anniversary of that evil deed, we\n19\n\nwish once again to express our solidarity with the\nUnited States and its people.\nIt is our conviction that success in the fight\nagainst international terrorism requires the genuine\ncooperation and solidarity of the entire international\ncommunity, no matter who might be the target of such\nterrorism. All those who directly or indirectly support\nand encourage terrorism should be held accountable.\nResources made available to terrorist groups, in\nwhatever guise, should not be tolerated regardless of\nthe area where this is taking place. In short, what is\nrequired is zero tolerance for terrorism regardless of its\nintended targets. It is not without reason that I am\nreiterating this point. For us in Ethiopia, terrorism is\nnot a theoretical threat. It is a practical and immediate\nthreat that we have had to face both before and after 11\nSeptember, including most recently. It is our earnest\nhope that the international community will do whatever\nis necessary to eliminate this scourge. We also hope\nthat there will be better days ahead, when we will all\nconcentrate on addressing the challenges that trouble\nour planet.\nI would like to conclude by renewing Ethiopia's\ncommitment to the United Nations and to what it\nstands for. We wish to see the United Nations become\nan even a more effective universal Organization and a\nmore forceful and faithful custodian of the principles of\ninternational law. Our hope and our dream is that the\nUnited Nations will be an even more robust universal\nOrganization catering to the legitimate interests of both\nbig and small counties. We in Ethiopia will continue to\ncontribute our share to the greater nurturing of\nmultilateralism and to making the United Nations an\neffective custodian of those values.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I wish to join\nother speakers in warmly congratulating you, Sir, on\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at\nits fifty-seventh session. My delegation offers you its\nfull support to the presidency's work. I also wish to pay\n26\n\ntribute to your predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, for his\nable guidance of the last session.\nIt gives me great pleasure to salute here\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan and the two new\nMembers of the United Nations, the Swiss\nConfederation and the Democratic Republic of East\nTimor.\nTurkey is firmly convinced that, throughout this\nnew century, the need for the United Nations will\nincreasingly grow. It is the only multilateral\nOrganization with universal membership dedicated to\nthe noble aims of maintaining peace and international\nsecurity, addressing global issues and establishing\nstandards that should apply to all.\nExactly a year ago, evil in its worst form struck\nNew York and Washington, D.C. Since the tragedy of\n11 September, it has become amply clear that terrorist\norganizations have much broader international\nnetworks than anticipated. Terrorism has many names\nand faces and recognizes no boundaries. This is a\nphenomenon that is not confined to and cannot be\nidentified with any particular geography, religion, race\nor culture. Terrorism is the most blatant violation of\nhuman rights. Nothing can ever justify terrorism and\nthere can be no leniency towards it.\nTurkey has been calling for years for intensified\ninternational cooperation against terrorism. We have\nbeen actively engaged in the work of the United\nNations to fight this scourge and we commend the\nongoing efforts. Security Council resolution 1373\n(2001), in particular, provides a clear road map with\nregard to the steps that need to be taken to combat\nterrorism more effectively.\nIt is incumbent upon all Member States to adopt\nexisting international legislation and to review their\nrelevant national laws accordingly. We urge those\nStates that have not yet done so to become parties to\nthe 12 international conventions on specific terrorist\noffences. We also look forward to the completion of the\nwork on a comprehensive convention against\ninternational terrorism.\nPreventive diplomacy and peacekeeping have\ngained even more priority in this era of new conflicts.\nTurkey has been actively participating in the efforts of\nthe United Nations in conflict prevention and plays a\nsignificant role within peace missions mandated by the\nUnited Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\nand the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope (OSCE). Hence, we commend the efforts of the\nSecretary-General to ensure prompt reaction to\nemerging crises and welcome the manifold\nconsiderations contained in his report (A/55/985) on\nthe prevention of armed conflicts.\nMy country took over the command of the\nInternational Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in\nKabul at an extremely critical juncture. We take pride\nin fulfilling that task and thank the other contributing\nnations. Indeed, all ISAF personnel are serving with a\nstrong sense of purpose and mission. Traditionally a\nclose friend of the Afghans, Turkey has contributed for\nmany years to the rehabilitation of Afghanistan. We\nsalute the performance of the Transitional Authority\nunder the leadership of His Excellency Mr. Hamid\nKarzai, the Afghan President.\nToday we must rapidly embark upon real and\ntangible development efforts in Afghanistan. It is with\nthis understanding that Turkey provides the Afghan\npeople with assistance that is directed at developing\ntheir national potential. Likewise, efforts to build the\nAfghan national army and the police force as well as\nsolidarity and unity among the ethnic groups are of\ncrucial importance.\nWe feel strongly that the international community\nshould fulfil its commitments adopted at the Tokyo\nInternational Conference on Reconstruction Assistance\nto Afghanistan. support His Excellency Mr. Lakhdar\nBrahimi, the Special Representative of the Secretary-\nGeneral for Afghanistan, in his efforts to secure greater\nfinancial assistance. The United Nations is to be\ncommended for successfully spearheading\nreconstruction activity.\nTurkey is located in close proximity to many of\nthe existing conflict spots and potential new threats\nthat are high on the United Nations agenda.\nAccordingly, we are closely interested in promoting\npeace, stability and prosperity in our part of the world,\nparticularly in the Balkans, the Middle East and the\nCaucasus.\nWe have been witnessing positive changes in the\npolitical and security environment of the Balkans. The\nmulti-ethnic, multi-religious and multicultural fabric of\nthe Balkan countries must be preserved. We believe\nnow is the right time for the word Balkans' to be\nfreed from its negative connotation and be made to\n27\n\nstand for such positive concepts as ethnic harmony,\nmutual respect and peaceful cohabitation.\nWe hope that the elections in the Republic of\nMacedonia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and\nthose to be held in a few weeks' time in Kosovo, will\nbe instrumental in shaping a better future for the\nBalkans.\nOur resolve to further improve our relations with\nGreece through the current process of constructive\ndialogue remains intact. We seek to encourage and\nfoster the spirit of friendship and cooperation so that\nwe can make further progress. In that respect, the two\ncountries signed a number of bilateral documents. As\nfor the Aegean Sea, we believe that Turkish-Greek\nrelations have indeed reached a level of maturity that\ncould enable us to address the issues at hand on a\nbilateral basis. To that end, we have been discussing\ncertain confidence-building measures and have agreed\non some. We are also encouraged by the ongoing\nexploratory contacts.\nRegarding Cyprus, we continue to support the\nefforts aimed at finding a just, viable, lasting and\ncomplete settlement. Cyprus is an issue between the\ntwo equal, distinct peoples on the island, namely the\nTurkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots, each of\nwhich lives under its own political and democratic\nstructures. The two peoples of Cyprus should be able to\ncoexist and share power under a new partnership State\nstructure on the basis of the equal status and sovereign\nequality of the two partner States. We will continue to\nsupport the current direct talks between the two leaders\nin Cyprus, which enable the two parties to search for\ncomprehensive reconciliation without any third-party\ninvolvement. We believe that equal treatment of both\nsides will foster an environment that will encourage\nthem to move towards a new partnership of equals,\nexcluding the possibility of reverting to the situation\nthat existed before 1974. We support the recent Turkish\nCypriot proposals, which provide a sound and realistic\nbasis for a settlement. We believe that the international\ncommunity should give due consideration to these\nproposals, which open a new window of opportunity\nfor the resolution of this longstanding issue.\nThe decision of the European Union Council to\nstart accession negotiations with the Greek Cypriot\nadministration, despite the illegitimacy of its claim to\nrepresent the whole island, has made an agreed\nsettlement even more elusive. Unfortunately, the Greek\nCypriot focus so far has been totally diverted to\nEuropean Union membership. Membership prior to\nsettlement would create many problems and would lead\nto tensions on the island and in the eastern\nMediterranean in general. We have reiterated that a\nunilateral Greek Cypriot entry into the European Union\nwould harm the chances for a mutually agreed\nsettlement establishing a new partnership between the\ntwo parties. The European Union must tell the Greek\nCypriots that they will not be admitted before a final\nsettlement. That is essential if we are to make\nmeaningful progress towards resolving the Cyprus\nissue.\nIn the aftermath of 11 September, peace and\nstability in the Middle East have gained even more\nimportance and urgency. Yet the present outlook of the\nongoing conflict does not leave much room for\noptimism. Violence persists, taking a huge toll on both\nsides. This year has been marked by successive\nterrorist attacks on Israeli civilians and the\ndisproportionate use of force by Israel against the\nPalestinians. The occupation of Palestinian towns and\nthe destruction of Palestinian infrastructure have only\nexacerbated the already difficult living conditions of\nthe Palestinian people.\nThe parameters of peace in the Middle East are\nembedded in Security Council resolutions 242 (1967)\nand 338 (1973). Those resolutions have now been\ngiven fuller meaning with the adoption of Council\nresolution 1397 (2001), laying out the vision of two\nStates living side by side within secure boundaries.\nThe international community is also encouraged\nby the Arab League plan adopted at its Beirut Summit,\nbased on a vision of the coexistence of all States in the\nregion through the full implementation of the relevant\nSecurity Council resolutions. Likewise, the 24 June\nstatement of the United States President charts the\ncontours of a process that will lead to the two-State\nobjective.\nThe international community should engage itself\nin encouraging and persuading all parties to the Middle\nEast conflict on the road to lasting peace. The\ninitiatives of the quartet' are welcome, and Turkey, as\na regional facilitator, is ready to offer its assistance in\nwhatever way may be necessary. We need a\n28\n\nrelaunching of the peace process, and Turkey stands\nready to host a meeting to that end.\nMore than a decade after the liberation of Kuwait,\nthe Iraqi problem remains unresolved. The\nrepercussions of the Gulf war still prevail. The adverse\neffects of that situation on the people of Iraq, on\nTurkey and on the region as a whole are increasing.\nThe only way out for Iraq is to cooperate fully with the\nUnited Nations by implementing the relevant Security\nCouncil resolutions. Turkey has been encouraging Iraq\nin that direction. We would like to see an Iraq whose\nterritorial integrity and political unity are preserved\nand which is peacefully reintegrated into the\ninternational community.\nThe Caucasus is another area of close interest for\nTurkey. We aim to help in establishing comprehensive\ncooperation in the region. However, the unresolved\nconflicts in Nagorny-Karabakh and Abkhazia still stand\nas principal obstacles to political stability and\neconomic development. The Security Council has\nadopted four resolutions urging the immediate\nwithdrawal of all troops from the Azerbaijani\nterritories, with which Armenia has not complied.\nBeing an active member of the Minsk Group,\nTurkey is working for a peaceful resolution of the\nNagorny-Karabakh conflict within the framework of\nthe OSCE. We initiated a tripartite meeting among the\nMinisters for Foreign Affairs of Armenia, Azerbaijan\nand Turkey in May.\nThe Abkhazian conflict still endangers peace and\nstability in Georgia and in the entire region. From the\noutset, Turkey has supported the peaceful resolution of\nthe conflict within the framework of the sovereignty,\nindependence and territorial integrity of Georgia.\nIn addition to the challenges of building national\nstructures and of achieving economic growth, the\nyoung States of Central Asia have faced a set of new\nthreats: radical religious movements, terrorist\nactivities, drugs and weapons trafficking. After the\ntragedy of 11 September, the international community\nfinally acknowledged the importance of stability in the\nregion and of the need to support reform efforts.\nTransition to full democracy in Central Asia should be\nseen as a process to be completed gradually as nation-\nbuilding, political stability and economic conditions\nare enhanced.\nThe United Nations is the vehicle for the\nrealization of global expectations. We know that its\nfuture rests to a great extent on its responsiveness to\nthe crisis of development in societies which have fallen\nbehind.\nAs things stand, the process of globalization, the\ndominant force of our time, has amply shown its\ninherent weaknesses, which are apt to create profound\nissues of imbalance and inequality. A case can be made\nin favour of globalization's ability to raise the level of\nprosperity, to reduce poverty and to enhance liberties.\nHowever, the fears of the masses cannot be completely\nallayed without evidence of more responsive\nmanagement of that process. Conflict, poverty,\ndiscrimination and injustice still blight the lives of\nmillions in every part of the globe. More than 80\ncountries now have per capita incomes lower than\nthose of a decade or more ago. Poverty is an offence to\nthe conscience of the modern world.\nIn view of all those considerations, Africa has a\nspecial and urgent claim to global engagement and\nconcern. My country supports efforts aimed at\nalleviating problems that afflict that continent. At this\ngathering, I wish to salute the birth of the African\nUnion. We hope that Africans will thus be able to work\nmore effectively to attain their goals.\nIn the same vein, Turkey has attributed great\nimportance to the achievement of the goals and\nprinciples adopted initially at the 1992 Rio Conference\non Environment and Development and compiled under\nAgenda 21. They have been our guidelines in\ncombating poverty and in protecting the global\nenvironment throughout the last decade, which has\nbrought us to the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment, recently held in Johannesburg.\nBefore I conclude, I wish to underline one very\nimportant aspect of our foreign policy. Fifty years after\nthe cornerstone was laid, the integration of Europe is\ngaining further momentum. The dynamic of European\nUnion enlargement is opening up new horizons. The\nrecognition of Turkey as a candidate for accession to\nthe European Union has ushered in a new era in\nrelations between Turkey and the European Union.\nTurkey is determined to be part of the historic process\nof unifying Europe.\nThe past decade has presented us with many\nthreats to security. Each has created its own challenge.\nBut one fundamental lesson can be drawn from them\n29\n\nall: no single State or organization is able to meet those\nmodern challenges on its own. We need to work\ntogether closely. The United Nations is the very forum\nin which we can achieve international cooperation and\nharmonization to meet those challenges. As always,\nTurkey stands ready to do its utmost to contribute to\nthe realization of its noble goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to take this\nopportunity to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your\nelection. My Government hails the selection of a leader\nwith such esteemed qualifications, and we are\nconfident you will lead the work of this body in the\nsame distinguished manner as that of your predecessor,\nHis Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo of the Republic of\nKorea.\nThe tragic events just over one year ago in this\ngreat city and elsewhere in the United States have\ntransformed the nature of life throughout the world,\nreaching the farthest corners of the planet. My country,\nfar removed from the devastation of that fateful day in\nSeptember 2001, reaffirms its full support for the\nefforts to bring those responsible to justice. More\nbroadly, we extend our unwavering support for all\nmeasures necessary to combat terrorism and one day,\nwe hope, to eliminate it.\nWe in the Federated States of Micronesia are\ndoing our part to work towards a more effective global\nantiterrorism network by putting in place measures to\ninterdict the movement of terrorists and their funds\nthrough our region. We look forward to the work\nplanned in that regard for this session of the General\nAssembly.\nThe meetings of the Pacific Islands Forum this\nyear were dominated by security considerations in the\nwake of those events. We note with full support the\nNasonini Declaration, which enhances existing regional\nsecurity measures. Likewise, speaking as Chairman of\nthe Standing Committee of the Pacific Islands\nConference of Leaders, I am confident in saying that\nevery island leader is personally committed to seeing\nthat our region serves no useful purpose for the dark\nforces of terrorism.\nThe realm of international security has seen\nfundamental and beneficial change in the past year.\nSadly, the same is not true for most other primary\nissues on our agenda, notably the elimination of\npoverty and stemming the tide of environmental\ndegradation.\nOn those issues, as a developing country, we\nshare the concerns and positions of other developing\ncountries. We have all made powerful statements and\nset lofty goals through the Rio Declaration 10 years\nago, the Millennium Declaration two years ago and,\nmost recently, the Monterrey Consensus and the\nJohannesburg Declaration. Of special interest to my\ndelegation, I would note that the same holds for the\nDeclaration of Barbados on the Sustainable\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. Yet it\nis true that progress has been slow in addressing the\nneeds of the world's poor. Likewise, 10 years after the\nRio Summit, the quality of our environment and its\nability to sustain future generations still diminishes\ndaily.\nAt the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment, held in Johannesburg, the Federated\nStates of Micronesia joined the other Pacific Island\ncountries in proposing a number of umbrella initiatives\nthat provide a framework for partnerships with\ndeveloped countries to assist us in implementing\nsustainable development. Those initiatives reflect our\ncommon concerns but recognize the uniqueness of each\nof our island nations. We hope that those practical\nproposals will help to turn decades of pronouncements\ninto action. We are encouraged that some of our Pacific\nneighbours, such as New Zealand and Australia, have\nalready come forward with specific partnership\nproposals, and we look forward to the support of the\n17\n\nUnited Nations system as well. Such developments\nconvince us that Johannesburg will be remembered as a\nlandmark on our long journey.\nWe appreciate the international community's\ndecision to hold the next Barbados review conference\nin 2004, and we look forward to adopting concrete\ngoals and timetables at the international level by that\ntime.\nDevelopment and the environment are inexorably\nlinked. That truth has been reaffirmed in each of these\nDeclarations. We all know that there cannot be\nsustainable development without environmental\nprotection, and there cannot be environmental\nprotection without sustainable development. Nor can\nthe world hope to support 6 billion people at the level\nof consumption we now see in the developed world.\nThe future will require sacrifice: sacrifice on the part\nof the North, to adopt more sustainable living practices,\nand by the South, which must recognize that the past\ndevelopment paths followed by the North unfortunately\ndo not lead to a sustainable future.\nIt is this body, above all others, that will grapple\nwith those painful realities. We must realize that they\npresent issues even more complex than some of our\nmore familiar geopolitical concerns.\nAmong other things, new attention must be given\nto the reform of the United Nations, because we must\naddress more than just structural adjustments in the\nrepresentational format of our body. This reform must\ntake due account that the entire world is reassessing\nour accustomed ways of living. Still, there must be a\nstart. First and foremost, we call on all nations to give\nfresh consideration to reform of the Security Council to\nbetter reflect today's realities. In that regard, we\nreiterate our support for permanent seats for Japan and\nGermany and for a system that ensures more equitable\nrepresentation by developing countries.\nThe Federated States of Micronesia is engaged on\nall issues before this body that affect us. But, given our\nunique circumstances, we have no choice but to place\ntop priority on protection of the oceans and the climate.\nGlobal ocean policy has been a bright spot in recent\nyears, particularly as it relates to the Pacific. Pacific\nisland Governments recently concluded work on a\nregional ocean policy, and they have developed a\nnumber of positive new initiatives on fisheries and\nother related matters. Yet those positive\naccomplishments in ocean policy are threatened by\ncontinued violation of our sovereignty in the form of\nillegal fishing and trans-shipment of hazardous\nmaterials.\nOnly a few weeks ago, in defiance of\ninternational obligations, several of the world's largest\nindustrial powers collaborated once again in yet\nanother extremely dangerous shipment of radioactive\nmaterial through our region. Without prior notice or\nassurance of compensation for damage, this shipment\npassed within 30 miles of the capital of the Federated\nStates of Micronesia. Our expressed objections to this\nviolation of our exclusive economic zone were flatly\nignored. Effective regulation of ocean-based trans-\nshipment of these dangerous materials must find its\nway into the priorities of this body.\nSimilarly, with regard to climate change, we\nwelcome the positive accomplishments in the\nnegotiating arena under the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change, most notably the\nKyoto Protocol. We applaud those nations that have\njoined us in ratifying the Protocol, and we welcome\nwith anticipation its imminent entry into force. But the\nsad reality is that 10 years have passed since the\nFramework Convention became effective  10 more\nyears of damage to the earth's climate.\nA handful of countries have succeeded in\ncontinuing to stall progress in the reduction of global\ngreenhouse gas emissions. Again I ask these nations, as\nI have on each occasion when I have appeared before\nthis body, to reconsider their policies and to recognize\nthe international implications of their inaction.\nI call upon those nations to remember the wise\nwords of United States President Franklin D.\nRoosevelt, who said that\n`liberty does not permit an individual citizen or\ngroup of citizens to commit acts of depredation\nagainst nature in such a way as to harm their\nneighbours, and especially to harm future\ngenerations of Americans.'\nLet us not lose sight of the fact that there is now\nuniversal recognition of the reality of the problem of\nclimate change and its causes. In the light of that\nrecognition, it is not enough that most nations are\nwilling to take action. All must work together to\ndevelop effective mitigation strategies to prevent\nfurther damage, and to define and implement\nadaptation measures for the most vulnerable.\n18\n\nWe have just over 100,000 citizens in the\nFederated States of Micronesia. We have no natural\nsources of fossil fuel. We have become far too\ndependent on imports of fossil fuels during the past\nhalf-century; even so, our contribution to global\nemissions of greenhouse gases is negligible. Looking\nto the future, we have committed to a reduction and\neventual elimination of fossil fuel for energy\nproduction. But we must rely on Western technologies\nif we are to move in the direction of renewable sources\nof energy. Thus, we are disturbed by the policies of\ndeveloped countries that give little more than lip\nservice to development of renewable energy\ntechnologies.\nWe are alarmed at the continuing refusal of some\nnations even to begin to acknowledge the nature of the\nclimate problem, let alone to take progressive action to\nfight it. Also distressing is the fact that, at the same\ntime, some of those nations are reducing their aid\npresence in developing countries. Some feel that, just\nwhen the need is greatest, the world community is\nclosing in upon itself, in a cocoon of self-interest.\nIt is inconceivable to us that global champions of\nequity and democratic ideals  nations whose\nprinciples we seek to emulate  could assume a\nposition on the most crucial social issues of our time\nthat succumbs to private interests. These private\ninterests, for obvious reasons, insist that, to the extent\nany problem exists, it can be addressed in good time,\non a voluntary basis. My people find it very difficult to\nreconcile such private influences with the principles\nthose nations promote.\nThis fifty-seventh session provides a genuine\nopportunity for the world community as a whole to\ntake note of our recent conferences, to seize the\ninitiative and to set a course towards tangible progress\non the issues we all agree to be of common concern.\nIn conclusion, our deepest sympathies are\nextended to the victims of war, terrorism, political\ninjustice, environmental degradation and economic\nwant throughout the world. We hope and pray that our\nactions here might, in ways large and small, lead to a\nbetter world for them and for us all.\nThe Federated States of Micronesia is a small\nforce within the community of nations. Nevertheless,\nwe pledge our full assistance and cooperation towards\nthe attainment of this goal. We take to heart the words\nof British statesman Sir Francis Bacon, who once said:\n`He makes the greatest mistake who decides to do\nnothing because he can do so little.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAt the outset, I wish to\ncongratulate Mr. Kavan on his successful election to\nthe leadership post of this Assembly and to offer my\ncountry's welcome to East Timor and Switzerland\nfollowing their recent admission into our family of\nnations.\nWe gather here slightly more than one year after\nthe appalling, unconscionable events of 11 September\n2001. The world is still striving to come to grips with\nthe full implications of the inhumane savagery of the\nattacks here in New York and in Alexandria, Virginia.\nGiven the great number of areas in which the various\nMembers of this Organization have differing and often\ncompeting interests, we can all derive hope and pride\nfrom the fact that the solidarity so evident in the\nGeneral Assembly last year is still largely intact today.\nGovernments around the world continue to cooperate\nin efforts to identify, locate and shut down terrorist\norganizations and those who would give comfort and\naid to such organizations.\nPalau, in spite of the inherent limitations imposed\nby its size, remoteness, capacity constraints and\neconomic vulnerability, has fully committed itself to\nworking with the community of nations to defeat\nterrorists and their sympathizers. We have aggressively\npursued revisions in our laws which make it easier to\ngather information on suspicious persons and activities,\nto share information with other jurisdictions, to block\nsuspect financial transactions, to establish domestic\ncriminal penalties for transnational crimes, to\nspecifically recognize acts of terror as crimes under our\ndomestic legal system, and to streamline our\nprocedures for asset seizure and extradition in order to\nbetter cooperate with our comrades in this war on\nterrorism.\nHowever, the limitations to which I have referred\nare hampering our efforts to fully implement these\n2\n\nlaws. No matter how much we may wish to support the\nglobal war on terrorism, Palau, like many other\ndeveloping nations, will not be able to participate\nmeaningfully in this vital campaign without the\nassistance of the developed nations. Therefore, to those\nleading the combat against terrorism, Palau says:\n\u201cPlease, give us the tools we need to make a substantial\ncontribution to this fight and render practical support\nfor your efforts.\u201d\nWhile the great majority of nations remain united\nin their desire to see terrorism defeated \u2014 and that is a\ncause for hope \u2014 there are also grounds for concern.\nSome nations appear to be wavering in their resolve to\ntake concrete actions to prevent terrorist attacks, while\nsome others seem not to fully appreciate the new\ndynamic of the post-11 September world. Those who\nsupported or condone the events of 11 September take\nheart when they hear members of this body speak of\nwaiting for a consensus before acting to remove\ncredible threats to national and international stability.\nTerrorists and their sympathizers are likewise\ncomforted when they hear leaders continue to talk in\nthe old language of how to react to terrorism, rather\nthan speak of how to prevent and pre-empt the next\nattack. Nothing pleases the forces of global terror more\nthan hearing members of the world coalition against\nterrorism speak of measured and agreed-upon\nresponses to the next atrocity.\nThe bottom line is this: The potential for\ncatastrophic harm is so great that we cannot wait for\nthe next attack. In this regard, Palau fully supports the\nUnited States in its resolve to pre-empt further attacks\nand loss of life. The very laudable ideal of multilateral,\nconsensus-driven action is good, but it cannot justify\nand will not excuse the loss of human lives and the\ndegradation of human life that will result from giving\nthose who rely on or sponsor terror the opportunity to\nstrike first, either directly or by proxy. Palau therefore\ncalls upon the Members of the United Nations once\nagain to come together in their commitment to forestall\nfuture tragedies.\nAs noted earlier, we can derive some satisfaction\nfrom the fact that the goodwill and unity of purpose\nthat prevailed immediately after last year's subhuman\nattacks in large part continue to exist. However, Palau\nalso notes that the recent World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment revealed a dismal lack of commitment to\naddressing the development needs of the great majority\nof nations. The failure of key nations to recommit to\nthe goals of the Rio Earth Summit is equally\ndisappointing. Taken together, those developments\ndemonstrate that such goodwill and solidarity\napparently are confined to matters that most concern\nthe developed world.\nThe lack of progress on sustainable development\nalso strongly suggests that the developed world still\nsees developing nations such as Palau as mere token\nmembers of the international community, rather than as\nviable partners. The current view the developed nations\nseem to have of the developing world is unacceptable\nand can lead only to greater unrest and instability in the\nfuture.\nIt is time for the unity of purpose that\ncharacterizes the global war on terror to be brought to\nbear in an equally global campaign for sustainable\ndevelopment. It is time to take affirmative action to\ncounteract the effects of globalization and correct the\ntechnological imbalances that are widening the gap\nbetween developed and developing nations. It is time to\ntake concrete action to give developing nations the\ntools they need to manage and speed up their own\ndevelopment in ways that will lead to the replacement\nof dependence on foreign aid with dependence on\ndomestic industry. It is time to implement measures to\nend the marginalization of developing countries in the\nnew global economy. In that regard, Palau welcomes\nand applauds the Koizumi Initiative as one of the sadly\nfew positive outcomes of the World Summit on\nSustainable Development and calls upon all developed\nmembers of the United Nations to develop similar\ninitiatives.\nThe position of certain members of this body on\nfundamental environmental issues also suggests that\nglobal solidarity is limited to areas that concern the\nmajor Powers of the developed world. United Nations\nMembers that have enjoyed and continue to enjoy the\nhighest standard of living have done so and continue to\ndo so at the expense of the environmental integrity of\nour planet. Those major emitters are threatening the\nlives of small island States such as Palau, placing their\nmere comfort above our very existence. At the same\ntime, they seek our support for their goals and\ninitiatives. That, too, is unacceptable.\nFortunately, most of the developed world,\nincluding the governments of the major industrialized\neconomies of Japan and the European Union, has\nrecognized its responsibility and has endorsed the only\n3\n\nviable response to the existing and worsening adverse\nimpact of climate change, the Kyoto Protocol, and the\nno-regrets philosophy it embodies. It is time for those\ndeveloped nations which have shirked their\nresponsibilities and shunned the Kyoto Protocol to end\ntheir callous disregard for the fate of those nations\nmost vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate\nchange, to admit that the Kyoto Protocol remains the\nonly meaningful first step towards comprehensively\naddressing climate change and to join the great body of\nnations that have pledged to work together through the\nKyoto Protocol and beyond to combat the effects of\nclimate change.\nIt is time to take the lessons we have learned from\nthe war on terror, lessons regarding the fundamental\nimportance of working together to respond to a\ncommon threat, lessons regarding the very real\ninterdependence of all nations and lessons regarding\nthe need for, and ability of, nations to balance genuine\nglobal concerns against perceived self-interests and\napply them to the threats posed by climate change and\nsea-level rise.\nThroughout my remarks today, I have emphasized\nPalau's strong support \u2014 in some cases, demands \u2014\nfor global action to address the major threats to\nstability and progress in this new global order. That is\nbecause it has become apparent, as never before, that\nthe widest possible participation in responding to those\nthreats must be encouraged, if real and lasting solutions\nare to be found.\nIn light of that fact, Palau must once again note\nthe folly of excluding any potential partner from the\nefforts of the United Nations to meet the challenges we\nnow face and to prepare against the challenges to\ncome. Such exclusion is particularly short-sighted in\nefforts of the international community that go beyond\npolitics and address fundamental human concerns, such\nas health and education. For that reason, Palau must\nagain call upon the members of the United Nations to\nwelcome the Republic of China \u2014 Taiwan \u2014 into this\nOrganization. At the very least, the membership at this\nbody should endorse the participation of the Republic\nof China, Taiwan, in the World Health Organization,\nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization, the United Nations Development\nProgramme and similar bodies dedicated to improving\nthe human condition. Mere politics should not be\nallowed to compromise or prevent the development of\na truly global effort to alleviate human suffering and\nbetter mankind.\nIn the area of health, I have appeared before this\nbody in the past, where I discussed the ill effects of\ntobacco use and our responsibility to protect our youth\nfrom the threat of tobacco addiction. I appear before\nthe Assembly today to ask again for its complete\nsupport for the Framework Convention on Tobacco\nControl, in order to combat tobacco-related illnesses\nand complications.\nThroughout these remarks, I have also repeatedly\nreturned to the idea of security. That is primarily\nbecause we feel less secure in the aftermath of the\nmonstrous attacks of 11 September 2001. The very idea\nof security has taken on new meaning. Our collective\nunderstanding of the kind of cooperation and\nintegration that is necessary to provide effective\nsecurity has changed radically. Yet, one of the foremost\nbodies for dealing with security, the Security Council,\nhas remained unchanged. That can hardly be right. In\nthis new environment, it is time to re-examine the\ncomposition and powers of the Security Council, to\nconsider how it may be made both more accessible and\nmore accountable and to find ways to increase its\nability to respond in a prompt, flexible and effective\nmanner to the threats to peace that are sure to arise in\nthe future.\nIn closing, let me again confirm Palau's\ndedication to, and determination to take part in, the\nglobal efforts to meet the challenges facing us all.\nPalau will continue to do all it can to support universal\nresponses to threats to peace and stability, especially\nmid- and long-term threats, such as climate change and\nsea-level rise and the widening gaps between\ndeveloped and developing nations. On behalf of the\npeople and Government of the Republic of Palau, I call\nupon all Members of this great Organization to do\nlikewise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow\nme at the outset, on behalf of my delegation and on my\nown behalf to congratulate you wholeheartedly on your\nelection as President of this session of the General\nAssembly. As testimony to the esteem enjoyed by you\nand your country, Sir, you may rest assured of the\nsupport of the Rwanda delegation in carrying out your\ntasks.\nI should like to take this opportunity to pay a\nwell-deserved tribute to your predecessor for the\neffective way in which he guided our work during the\nfifty-sixth session.\nI should also like, on behalf of my Government,\nto express my gratitude and appreciation to the\nSecretary-General, Mr. Kofi Annan, for his tireless\nefforts to ensure the effective and transparent\nfunctioning of the United Nations and to promote\nworld peace.\nThe Government of Rwanda warmly welcomes\nthe Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste and the Swiss\nConfederation to the United Nations. We are already\nfamiliar with their contribution to the enhancement of\nthe role of our great United Nations family, especially\ntheir respect for the principles of equal rights and the\nright of peoples to self-determination.\nIn this connection, the Government of Rwanda\nappeals for appropriate measures to be taken to ensure\na fair and lasting settlement of the conflict in Western\nSahara, in accordance with the purposes and principles\nof the Organization. Furthermore, the Government of\nRwanda reiterates its hope that peace will be achieved\nin the Middle East \u2014 a peace that guarantees the\ncreation of a secure Palestinian State with recognized\nboundaries, coexisting peacefully with the State of\nIsrael, whose security should also be guaranteed.\nI should like to recall that, with the collapse of\nthe Berlin Wall and the end of the ideological war often\nreferred to as the cold war, the world entered a new era,\nwith a new economic order. Despite the existence of\nhotbeds of violence in a number of areas on all\ncontinents, we welcome and encourage initiatives\ndesigned to resolve the tensions created during the cold\nwar. In that connection, the Rwandan Government\nencourages talks between North and South Korea. We\nhope that the two parties will move forward towards\nthe peaceful reunification of the Korean Peninsula. The\nRwandan Government also supports the principle of\none China. The question of Taiwan is an internal matter\nfor China and can be effectively resolved out of the\ncontext of the ideological war that gave rise to it, in\naccordance with the principle, already accepted by the\nChinese themselves, of one country and two systems.\n19\n\nThis session of the General Assembly is being\nheld one year after the terrible events of 11 September\n2001. The terrorist attack perpetrated against the\nUnited States remains deeply etched in the memory of\nthe people of Rwanda, and I would like to reiterate our\nsolidarity with the American people. I do so with good\nreason: perhaps I should recall that, since 1994,\nRwanda has been living under the perpetual threat of\nterrorist groups based in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo, the most active of which is known as the\nArmy for the Liberation of Rwanda (ALIR), an\norganization made up of elements of the former\nRwandan Army (ex-FAR) forces and Interahamwe\nmilitias that were responsible for the 1994 genocide.\nThe leaders of ALIR were among those who planned\nand carried out the genocide in Rwanda. Since 1994\nsuch elements have attacked Rwanda on many\noccasions, carrying out the targeted killing of innocent\npeople and destroying social and economic\ninfrastructure of national and international\nsignificance. It was such elements that savagely\nmassacred American, British and New Zealand tourists\nin the Bwindi park in March 1999.\n\nNow, in an attempt to mislead international public\nopinion and escape justice, the members of this\nterrorist group are endeavouring to organize themselves\ninto political groups using a number of different labels.\nThe Government of Rwanda therefore appeals to the\nUnited Nations and its Member States to take the\nnecessary measures to track down and arrest all those\nresponsible for the Rwanda genocide who are now\nmembers of ALIR and to bring them to international\njustice. We also appeal to the United Nations and its\nMember States to formally condemn those countries\nthat finance, harbour or lend moral, material or\nlogistical support to the ALIR terrorist organization.\nWith regard to the prosecution of those accused\nof the Rwandan genocide, I reiterate the appeal of the\nRwandan Government to the international community\nto ensure the effectiveness and credibility of the\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda so that it\ncan truly fulfil the expectations of the people of\nRwanda and all justice-loving people. In this\nconnection, special attention should be paid to the\nrecommendations on this subject submitted by my\nGovernment to the Security Council. Furthermore, the\ntime has come for the international community to\nensure the implementation of the relevant\nrecommendations of the report on the Rwanda\ngenocide that was drafted under United Nations\nauspices, known as the Carlsson report.\nWith regard to the destabilizing effects of the\nterrorist activities of ALIR, I should like to advocate as\na remedy that support be given to the Lusaka and\nPretoria Agreements, which are designed to restore\npeace in the Great Lakes region. Those two\nAgreements provide for the disarmament,\ndemobilization, reintegration and repatriation of what\nare known as the negative forces that are operating in\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, which include\nex-FAR forces and Interahamwe. The Rwandan\nGovernment appeals as a matter of urgency to the\nUnited Nations and its Member States to spare no\neffort in strongly supporting the implementation of\nthose Agreements.\nAs for Rwanda, it has done its utmost to\nimplement those Agreements and to work to\nre-establish a genuine and lasting peace in the Great\nLakes region. In accordance with the statement made\nby Paul Kagame, President of the Rwandese Republic,\non 13 September during a meeting of the Security\nCouncil on the question of the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo, I would like to take this opportunity to\nannounce that, on 17 September, my Government\nbegan to withdraw its troops from the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, in conformity with the\nprovisions of the Pretoria Accord.\nMy Government is convinced that the\nimplementation of those Agreements will lead us not\nonly to the restoration of security and stability in our\nsubregion, but also to the establishment of a climate of\nconfidence and good cooperative relations that will\nfacilitate common actions in our struggle against the\nterrorist activities orchestrated by ALIR or by any\nother terrorist organization.\nIn this connection, I would like reaffirm the\ncommitment of the Government of Rwanda to\ncooperate fully to achieve the success of any initiative\ndesigned to prevent and repress terrorism in all its\nforms. In this connection, and in implementation of\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001), our\nGovernment has now ratified all the various\ninternational instruments to combat terrorism that we\nhad not signed or ratified previously, in addition to the\nOrganization of African Unity (OAU) Convention on\n20\n\nthe Prevention and Combating of Terrorism, which we\nhad already ratified. Rwanda has just submitted its first\nreport to the Security Council Committee established to\nfollow up the implementation of that resolution.\nRwanda is resolutely determined to combat terrorism,\nsource of desolation and instability for the international\ncommunity. We believe that the international\ncommunity should mobilize all of its means to fight\nand to put an end to poverty, which affects so much of\nour population. It should do more for the eradication of\ninjustice and inequality in order to ensure a better\nworld for future generations. Thus, we call for the\nstrengthening of the United Nations and the entire\nUnited Nations system to ensure the implementation of\nall of the international commitments to help poor\ncountries. Commitments, such as those expressed in the\nMillennium Declaration, in the Monterrey Consensus\nand at the Johannesburg Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment, should be reflected in concrete actions\nwithout delay. Third-world countries, especially\ncountries of Africa, set great store by this.\nIn Africa, we would like to root out the causes of\npoverty. We have already grasped the different aspects\nof the situation and decided upon a framework to guide\nus in this long struggle against poverty, namely the\nNew Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD).\nWithin NEPAD, we have pledged to put an end to\nfratricidal wars that devastate our already moribund\neconomies. We have pledged also to work towards\ndemocracy, good governance, and for letting the rule of\nlaw prevail.\nThe international community is hereby called\nupon to assist us in this process. We ask each of the\nrich countries to reexamine its positions regarding the\nterms that are often linked to various interventions\naimed at helping poor countries, particularly as regards\nthe debt and official development assistance (ODA).\nThis needs to be done in order to enable these countries\nto confront effectively the various scourges that\nthreaten them, including famine, pandemic diseases,\nHIV/AIDS, malaria, and so forth, so that they can\neventually catch up with the rich countries. Hence,\nglobalization will become profitable for the whole of\nmankind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffFirst of all, I would like to\ncongratulate Mr. Jan Kavan on his assumption of the\nPresidency of the fifty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly. At the same time, I pay high tribute to\nMr. Han Seung-soo, former President of the General\nAssembly, for his leadership.\nI am pleased on this occasion to congratulate\nSwitzerland on becoming a United Nations Member\nState. My congratulations also go to the Democratic\nRepublic of Timor-Leste, which declared its\nindependence on 20 May. Japan heartily supports its\nadmission to the membership of the United Nations.\nThe Peace Bell in the garden of United Nations\nHeadquarters was presented to the United Nations in\n1954 by the Japanese people with a prayer for world\npeace. It has been rung every year for world peace. The\nbeautiful sound of the bell, which was made from coins\ncollected from all over the world, reminds us of what\nthe United Nations represents.\nIn order to ensure world peace and prosperity, we\nneed to harmonize a range of efforts which encompass\nnot only military measures, but also initiatives for the\nsolution of poverty problems and the establishment of\nsocial infrastructures that will put an end to human\nrights violations. The United Nations should be a\nforum where the contributions of each and every State\nare consolidated and implemented in the most efficient\nmanner. No single State or organization can accomplish\nthis. Only the United Nations is capable of carrying out\nsuch a lofty task.\nIn this connection, I would like to refer to the\nissue of Iraq, which is of grave concern to the\ninternational community. Iraq must comply with all the\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. In particular,\nIraq must allow immediate and unconditional\ninspections and dispose of all weapons of mass\ndestruction. It is important for the international\ncommunity to continue to work together and to engage\nmore strenuously in diplomatic efforts through the\nUnited Nations. In doing so, we must pursue the\nadoption of necessary and appropriate Security Council\nresolutions as soon as possible.\nTerrorism remains a critical issue this year.\nToday, in addition to terrorism, I would like to take up\nother major challenges which the United Nations must\naddress and to describe Japan's contributions in those\nareas, namely, the consolidation of peace and nation-\nbuilding, the environment and development, and\nnuclear disarmament. I will also touch upon my ideas\nfor the realization of United Nations reform, which is\nessential in order for this Organization to tackle these\nchallenges successfully.\nThe first challenge is the fight against terrorism.\nJust after the terrorist attacks on 11 September, I\nvisited ground zero. Seeing with my own eyes the\nmagnitude of the destruction, I was speechless at the\nenormity of the terrorist attack. 11 September is a\nchallenge not only to the United States, but also to all\nhumankind. The prevention and eradication of\nterrorism are an important task for the United Nations\nand, indeed, for all Member States.\nJapan calls upon all States to accede to\ninternational conventions related to terrorism. It is\nimportant to develop international norms in this area,\nsuch as a comprehensive convention on international\nterrorism and an international convention for the\nsuppression of acts of nuclear terrorism. Safe havens\nfor terrorists cannot be allowed. Japan will further\nstrengthen its domestic counter-terrorism measures.\nConsulting closely with the Counter-Terrorism\nCommittee of the Security Council, it will share its\nknowledge and expertise in counter-terrorism measures\nwith those States that are in need of it. Japan will\nrespond to threats where weapons of mass destruction\nmight be used in acts of terrorism by actively joining\nthe efforts of the international community to prevent\nthe proliferation of these weapons.\n18\n\nThe second challenge is the consolidation of\npeace and nation-building. Japan attaches great\nimportance to extending post-conflict assistance for the\nconsolidation of peace and nation-building to prevent\nthe recurrence of conflicts. Having developed a\nmechanism to enable it to cooperate effectively in\nbroader areas, Japan has entered a new stage in its\ncooperation with peacekeeping operations. This\npositive posture is manifested in its deployment since\nFebruary of 690 Self-Defence Force personnel, mainly\nas an engineer group, to the peacekeeping operation in\nEast Timor. Japan will enhance its cooperation in other\nareas as well, such as demining, rehabilitation of\ninfrastructure, elections and the establishment of\nsystems for internal security.\nConcerning Afghanistan, at the International\nConference on Reconstruction Assistance to\nAfghanistan held in Tokyo in January, Japan strove to\nsolidify the resolve of the international community. We\nare now preparing a programme to assist the\ndemobilization and reintegration of former combatants,\nwhich will give form to our proposed Register for\nPeace. My country is also contributing to regional\nreconstruction by developing an assistance project for\nthe resettlement of refugees and displaced people in\nsuch areas as Kandahar.\nIn the Middle East, it is crucial that the vision of\nthe peaceful coexistence of Israel and an independent\nPalestinian State materialize as early as possible. Japan\nwill assist the reform of the Palestinian Authority,\nwhich is aimed at the establishment of a new State by\nthe Palestinian people. We will do so particularly by\nproviding technical assistance for democratization.\nElections by the Palestinians are the first step towards\nnation-building and I believe that the international\ncommunity should extend assistance to ensure their\nsuccess. However, putting an end to the vicious circle\nof violence remains our most urgent task. Japan\nresolutely condemns terrorist acts by Palestinian\nextremists and strongly urges Israel to immediately\nwithdraw its troops to the line of September 2000, halt\nits military operations and lift the economic closures in\nthe autonomous areas.\nIn Africa, peace and stability are prerequisites for\ndevelopment. We are encouraged by the positive\nmovements in that continent, such as the realization of\npeace in Angola and a partial ceasefire in Sudan. Japan\nwill actively support the efforts of African States for\nconflict resolution and the consolidation of peace.\nThe third challenge is the simultaneous\nachievement of environmental protection and\ndevelopment. Towards that end, it is of course\nimportant to utilize all available financial resources and\nto develop human resources, which are the engine of\nnation-building. However, ownership by developing\ncountries and their partnership with the international\ncommunity, which supports their ownership, are also\nessential.\nIn this respect, we welcome the development of\nthe New Partnership for Africa's Development\n(NEPAD) and the establishment of the African Union\nas manifestations of ownership by African countries. In\norder to help strengthen both African ownership and\nthe partnership with the international community, and\nbuilding on the results of the successful World Summit\non Sustainable Development that took place in\nJohannesburg, Japan will convene the third Tokyo\nInternational Conference on African Development\n(TICAD III) in October 2003. Also, in pursuit of\nsustainable development, it will host an international\nministerial-level conference on water in Kyoto in\nMarch 2003. Japan will continue to participate actively\nin worldwide actions for environmental protection and\ndevelopment by providing expertise and taking\nconcrete action.\nFourthly, I would like to touch upon the nuclear\ndisarmament issue. I believe that Japan, as the only\ncountry in human history to have suffered nuclear\ndevastation, has a significant role to play in nuclear\ndisarmament and non-proliferation. Japan will continue\nits efforts to realize a peaceful and safe world, free of\nnuclear weapons, as early as possible. To that end, we\nwill propose a draft resolution entitled A path to the\ntotal elimination of nuclear weapons' at this session of\nthe General Assembly, and we will redouble our efforts\nto achieve the early entry into force of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\nWhen addressing these challenges, we must\nensure that the variety of measures taken by Member\nStates are effectively coordinated. The United Nations\nmust exercise its leadership in this endeavour. We, that\nis all Member States, must breathe new life into the\nUnited Nations by strengthening its functions through\nreforms. Next year, the debate on Security Council\nreform will enter its tenth year. I believe that we should\n19\n\nnow focus our discussion on such questions as the\nnumber of seats on an enlarged Security Council. Japan\nintends to work hard to that end. In this connection, I\nwould remind all Member States of the question of the\nenemy State' clauses, meaningless legacies of the\ntwentieth century, that remain in the United Nations\nCharter.\nSince assuming office as Prime Minister in April\n2001, I have proceeded with a series of reforms to\nenable Japan to respond appropriately to the new era.\nThe United Nations also must continue to reform itself\nso as to respond to new situations in the world by\nconstantly reviewing its organization and functions.\nThe prescription for reform is already shown in the\nMillennium Declaration. In order to achieve the goals\ncontained in the Declaration and build a more peaceful,\nprosperous and just world, every Member State should\nrenew its determination to achieve reform in the United\nNations and take actions toward that end. Japan will\nmake its utmost efforts to ensure that the United\nNations is able to meet the challenges of the twenty-\nfirst century.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOver the Assembly\nhangs a cloud of uncertainty \u2014 indeed, of unease \u2014\nabout the future of multilateralism and of international\nrelations generally. The tragedy of 11 September 2001,\nwhich we commemorated just three days ago, has so\nnumbed our minds that we have yet to fully understand\nits consequences. Therefore, it is meet that, as a family\nof nations, we should not only remember the disaster,\nbut also seek to learn from it how we can best restore\nto mankind some measure of faith and hope in our\ncommon humanity.\nMy delegation is pleased to see Mr. Jan Kavan\npresiding over the Assembly, since, as the\nrepresentative of a country that has known the horror\nof war, he will undoubtedly inspire us to find our way\nforward. In wishing his presidency well, I would also\nlike to place on record our gratitude to His Excellency\nMr. Han Seung-soo of the Republic of Korea for\n21\n\nguiding us through a most difficult and challenging\ntime. Our appreciation and thanks must also extend to\nthe Secretary-General, who, throughout these past\nmonths, has helped to sustain our commitment to the\npurposes and principles of the United Nations.\nWe are pleased to welcome Switzerland as a full\nmember of the family of nations, and we look forward\nto doing the same for East Timor when it takes its place\namong us.\nThe international system is now plagued by\ndangerous instability which threatens to undermine \u2014\nif not to destroy \u2014 many of our States. Not only do we\nface terrorism, with its horrific violence, but we must\nalso live with other manifestations of terror in the form\nof poverty, hunger and disease, which, although more\nsilent, are no less deadly.\nConflict, both within and among States, clearly\ndemonstrates how poorly an economy functions\nwithout political and social cohesion. Divisions that\nrend the fabric of our societies \u2014 divisions that derive\nultimately from ethnicity and race \u2014 are not only\nseverely counterproductive to our attempts to better the\ncommonweal, but preclude the emergence of the\ndurable peace and tranquillity without which we will\nnever be able to prosper.\nRecent global conferences have focused our\nattention on the importance of a rights-based approach\nto social inclusion. However, commitment to inclusive\npolicies rests not only with States but with civil society\nas a whole. Poverty and underdevelopment are now\neasily exploited by some elements in our societies to\nundermine the authority of democratically elected\nGovernments and to exacerbate ethnic and other\ntensions.\nThis instability is further compounded by the\nrampant trade in illegal drugs and arms, with its\nattendant corruption and violence, which daily tests the\nlegal, financial, security and governance capabilities of\nmost small States. The social contract between the\nState and its citizens has been seriously jeopardized by\nthese new political developments. Greater national\nendeavours and international solidarity are now\nnecessary if we are to confront these challenges and\nensure the economic and social progress of our\npeoples.\nOld conflicts persist, denying entire populations\nthe opportunity to live in peace and security. The\nsituation in the Middle East must be of special concern\nto us all, since it threatens to become a wider conflict.\nThe right of the Palestinian people to national self-\ndetermination \u2014 a right guaranteed by international\nlaw \u2014 must be upheld if there is to be a just and\nlasting solution to the region's problems.\nThe tensions which exist in India-Pakistan\nrelations with regard to Kashmir should not be allowed\nto persist, given the risk of calamitous nuclear conflict.\nAs a country which is committed to the pacific\nsettlement of disputes and as a friend of those two\nimportant countries of Asia, from which many of our\nown ancestors originated, Guyana wishes to encourage\nthem to continue their search for a definitive solution.\nGlobal instability results also from our failure to\nimplement the Agenda for Development. After more\nthan a decade of development-related conferences, we\nhave yet to grasp fully the implications for\ninternational cooperation of an increasingly\ninterdependent world and a globalized economy. The\nrecent meetings in Doha, Monterrey and Johannesburg\nbrought the international community full circle in\nassessing the effectiveness of global collective action\naimed at the realization of the millennium development\ngoals and the eradication of poverty. We should now be\nfully persuaded that global action remains\nindispensable to the development process.\nWhat is less clear, however, is the relationship\nthat should underlie such action, which continues to be\na daunting challenge. To what extent can equality be\nachieved in a system of skewed economic and military\npower? Will sovereignty ever subject itself to the\nimperatives of the global good? How can trustworthy\nprocedures be found for international intervention in\nsituations characterized by the threat of collapse of\nnational social and economic structures? What more\ncan be done so that the current international trading\nsystem is beneficial for all States, not for only a select\nfew? How can the policies of the Bretton Woods\ninstitutions be made more responsive to the concerns\nand needs of the developing countries in particular?\nI know that there are no easy answers to these\nquestions. Indeed, each international conference and\nevery general debate that takes place in this Assembly\nhas made us more aware of how difficult it is to find a\nconsensual approach to these issues. Dialogue and\nengagement are continuously balanced against hasty\nattempts to achieve short-term goals. Yet the\n22\n\nimperative of global stability \u2014 both political and\neconomic \u2014 requires a greater symbiotic relationship\namong States. The increased permeability of borders,\nwhich has made all countries vulnerable to contagion\nfrom outside, is a reality which we cannot ignore.\nMeanwhile, the debate on the benefits of\nglobalization is becoming increasingly polarized.\nDespite their own best efforts at reform and\nrestructuring, many developing countries have not\nreally seen any significant improvement in their\neconomic and social condition. The growth rate of\nmost developing countries was 2 per cent lower in the\n1990s than it was in the oil crisis years of the 1970s.\nSimilarly, although the number of people living in\nextreme poverty, on less than one dollar a day, has\nreportedly decreased the past 15 years, those living on\nless than two dollars a day \u2014 an insignificant sum \u2014\nhas increased. Thus, poverty figures have in effect\nremained high, despite an improvement in world\nincome over the past decade by an average of 2.5 per\ncent annually.\nThe situation has been especially difficult for\nsmall States. Over the past 10 years, the States\nmembers of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM),\nof which we are one, have been pursuing aggressive\nsocio-economic reform measures designed to enhance\nthe region's economic competitiveness so as to benefit\nfrom globalization. The results have generally been\ndisappointing, in large part due to the small size, and\nthe geographic location of the CARICOM countries, as\nwell as their limited natural resource base and high\ndependence on international trade, all of which make\ntheir economies vulnerable to changes in the global\neconomy. The situation is further aggravated by the\nhigh incidence of HIV/AIDS \u2014 the second highest in\nthe world.\nSmall States such as ours in the Caribbean require\ndevelopment cooperation that is based on mutual trust\nand the fulfilment of commitments. One major step in\nthis direction should be to focus on new ways of\nbalancing equity, economics and ecology in order to\ncreate opportunities for small economies without\ninflicting disillusionment and despair. Every effort\nshould also be made to ensure the full implementation\nof the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative\nso as to liquidate the debt burden in the poorest\ncountries. To address the challenge of development, an\nintegrated strategy must be found to address all the\ndifferent elements of the problem.\nNow \u2014 especially since Monterrey \u2014 it is\nfashionable to speak of partnership for sustainable\ndevelopment. Indeed, partnership, if properly\nconceived and implemented, can serve to eradicate\npoverty and promote economic growth. However, as\nthe President of Guyana stated at the World Summit on\nSustainable Development, in Johannesburg, if it is to\nsucceed, partnership between States must be based not\non double standards but on mutual trust and respect and\non the interests of all parties. Public/private-sector\npartnerships must be founded on equity and\ntransparency, with full regard to the laws of our\ncountries. Finally, partnerships with multilateral\nfinancial institutions must be informed more by an\nunderstanding of the situation in our countries and less\nby a doctrinaire approach to policy-making. To quote\nthe President directly, \u201cProgress will only come if there\nis an enlightened understanding of partnership.\u201d\nConcerned by the inadequacy of past\ndevelopment models and the trend towards leaving\ndevelopment matters largely to market forces, Guyana\nhas sought to promote at the United Nations the\nconcept of a new global human order based on a\ngenuine partnership for cooperation. By addressing the\nproblems of peace and development in a holistic\nmanner, this \u201cconcordat\u201d would provide developing\ncountries with the structural, strategic and long-term\nsupport that they need. Guyana hopes to build upon\nresolution 55/48 in the coming months with the aim of\nbringing greater predictability and stability to\ninternational development cooperation.\nIt is clear that the period ahead of us is fraught\nwith difficulty, and that some of the challenges are\nhistorically unprecedented in scale. The instability and\nuncertainty by which so many societies around the\nworld are afflicted must be attended to if we are to\navoid failure. We must therefore ready the United\nNations, the most important and most widely supported\ninternational governmental organization in existence,\nto address these problems. There is simply nowhere\nelse to take them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Early in the\ntwenty-first century the world perceived the grave\nreality of new challenges and threats. We also\ncame to understand that the evil of international\nterrorism can be eradicated only through joint\nconcerted efforts.'\nToday, we have every reason to state that the\nworld community has managed to confront the threat of\nglobal terrorism by creating a broad international\ncoalition. The measures taken by the United Nations in\nresponse to the unprecedented acts of international\nterrorism mark a new and significant direction in the\nOrganization's activities.\nBelarus considers itself an integral part of the\nanti-terrorism coalition. We fully support the Counter-\nTerrorism Committee and have been actively involved\nwith it in the context of unconditional implementation\nof Security Council resolutions. We also believe the\nCounter-Terrorism Committee provides a fruitful\nexchange of experience in the area of combating\nterrorism that involves the Member States,\ninternational organizations and regional institutions.\nThe President, Government and Security Council\nof the Republic of Belarus have been focusing on ways\nto combat terrorism. In January 2002, we adopted a law\nto combat terrorism, which has entered into force. Our\n22\n\ncountry is a party to 9 of the 12 major multilateral\ninternational treaties on combating terrorism. We are\nnow working on accession to the three other treaties.\nThe outcome of the groundbreaking work of the\nCounter-Terrorism Committee will serve as a basis for\nsetting up a universal model for counter-terrorism\nlegislation and for its implementation.\nThe Republic of Belarus will contribute to\nelaborating a comprehensive convention on combating\ninternational terrorism and acts of nuclear terrorism.\nWork on those two instruments should be the focus of\nthe Secretary-General's attention, since international\nterrorism today has challenged two Powers, two\npermanent members of the Security Council: the\nUnited States and Russia. It has also challenged the\nentire international community. We have accepted that\nchallenge; our response is clear. We, the United\nNations, will eliminate terrorism.\nThe focus of attention at the last session was\npeople and their needs in a global world; we agree with\nthat approach. The Millennium Declaration is our guide\nas we work on those issues. We considered possible\noptions for implementing the Millennium Declaration\nat two recent important international forums  the\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment at Monterrey and the World Summit on\nSustainable Development at Johannesburg. Those two\nforums marked a transition between identifying\ncommon goals and actually implementing them. The\nmain task facing this session is to draw conclusions\nwith regard to that work and determine the specific\nactions to be taken in order to implement the\nagreements. Our delegation is ready to act together\nwith other Member States to this end.\nMy Government attaches paramount importance\nto integrating environmental and social aspects into our\nnational strategy for sustainable development.\nBelarus agrees with the analysis made at the\nJohannesburg Summit of what has been done to\nachieve sustainable development over the past decade\nand how we can tackle global issues in the twenty-first\ncentury.\nOur country is entering the new millennium as an\nimportant geopolitical element in a modern Europe. We\nhave a stable economic and social infrastructure and\nthe highest human development index among the\ncountries of the Commonwealth of Independent States.\nBelarus seeks constructive interaction and mutually\nbeneficial partnership with our neighbouring countries\nin the interest of building a united Europe. The\nprospect of sustainable development in Europe cannot\nbe realized without a stable Belarus acting as a reliable\nEurasian bridge. On that basis, our President and\nGovernment have been determining the role that\nBelarus will play in the implementation of the\ndecisions of the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment.\nThe conferences at Monterrey and Johannesburg\nshowed the importance of taking into account the\ninterests of countries with transitional economies in\nstructuring a stable world for the twenty-first century.\nOver the past decade, our countries have come a long\nway in transitioning to the market economy and\nintegrating fully into international trade, economic and\nfinancial systems. But the States in that group are at\ndifferent stages of macroeconomic and financial\nstability and sustained economic growth because of the\nparticular characteristics of their individual situations\nowing to internal and external factors.\nTherefore, it is important to continue\ninternational efforts to make market reforms\nirreversible in the countries with transitional\neconomies. We must also take account of and try to\nmitigate the social consequences and ensure that our\ncountries are fully integrated into the world economy.\nBelarus looks forward to a fruitful discussion of the\ndraft, which we will be introducing at this session of\nthe General Assembly.\nSustainable development in Belarus relates\ndirectly to dealing with the consequences of the\nChernobyl disaster, the largest radiation disaster of the\npast century. Economic damage in Belarus is estimated\nat $US 235 billion. We have invested $US 13 billion in\nrestoring the social and economic sectors of that\nregion. The health of the affected population is still a\nserious concern. At the same time, Chernobyl-related\nissues have been losing the attention of the\ninternational community, leaving Belarus to face the\nconsequences alone. Belarus has urged a shift in focus\nof international Chernobyl-related cooperation away\nfrom humanitarian assistance to socio-economic\nrehabilitation and sustainable development in the\naffected regions.\nWe welcome the active role played by the United\nNations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian\nAffairs, Mr. Kenzo Oshima, who personally visited the\n23\n\naffected regions earlier this year. We are grateful to\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan for supporting Mr.\nOshima in this endeavour. We welcome the work of\nsome members of the United Nations Inter-Agency\nTask Force on Chernobyl, who seek to set up an\nInternational Chernobyl Research Board to study the\nlong-term consequences of radiation effects on human\nbeings and the environment in Belarus.\nBelarus supports United Nations partnership with\nnon-governmental organizations and the private sector.\nWe believe this can help to mobilize additional\nresources for our purposes. However, voluntary\ninitiatives should supplement intergovernmental\nagreements, not replace them.\nPeace, security and stability are prerequisites to\nsustainable development. But this past year has shown\nthat international peace and security are still fragile.\nWe witnessed a sharp escalation of confrontation in the\nMiddle East. This region could become the centre of a\ndangerous collision between civilizations.\nThe Middle East Quartet, with the participation of\nthe United Nations, the European Union, the Russian\nFederation and the United States, inspires some\noptimism from the standpoint of the understanding\nreached by all participants in the peace process that\ntwo independent states  Israel and Palestine  have\nto coexist. This understanding is enshrined in legally\nbinding documents of the United Nations. Gradually\ntaking steps to mutual reconciliation through\ncontinuous dialogue between the parties involved will\nhelp, and the United Nations must be active here.\nThere is no alternative to the peace process in\nAfghanistan. Significant financial, material and human\nresources have already been allocated to Afghanistan to\nhelp to create a new Afghanistan, a stable and\npredictable partner in modern international relations.\nBelarus wishes to make its contribution. Our State\nAviation Committee has participated in transporting\nhumanitarian supplies from Europe to Afghanistan.\nWe believe the establishment of the African\nUnion was a landmark step for Africa. This major\nregional association, with support from the\ninternational community, will hasten a solution to\nAfrican problems, particularly ethnic and religious\nconflict. Belarus will help to approve projects and\nprogrammes for economic and humanitarian\ndevelopment in Africa through the United Nations.\nThis year was marked by important agreements\non strategic stability. Belarus welcomes the signing in\nMoscow of the Treaty on Strategic Offensive\nReductions between the Russian Federation and the\nUnited States. We support constructive dialogue\nbetween the nuclear States in order to create a\ngenuinely safe multi-polar world.\nInternational efforts for the entry into force of the\nComprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) must\ncontinue. A new impetus must be given to the\nConference on Disarmament. More work must be done\non reducing conventional weapons.\nBelarus has contributed to setting up the new\nsecurity architecture from Vancouver to Vladivostok by\ndepositing our ratification instruments for the Open\nSkies Treaty in November 2001.\nAt this session, we will be proposing a draft\nresolution entitled Prohibition of the development and\nmanufacture of new types of weapons of mass\ndestruction and new systems of such weapons'. We\ntrust it will be unanimously supported, as it was last\nyear in the General Assembly.\nBelarus believes the Security Council must play a\nkey role in maintaining international peace and\nsecurity, including the situation of Iraq. Belarus\nwelcomes the recent decision by the Government of\nIraq to allow for the immediate and unconditional\nreturn of United Nations weapons inspectors to Iraq.\nAny action or attempt to evade the authority of\nthe United Nations Security Council, or any non-\nfulfilment by States of decisions by the Council, will\nundermine the legal basis of the existing system of\ninternational relations and jeopardize the basis of the\ninternational legal order.\nReform of the United Nations is essential to\nsuccessfully accomplish its tasks. As a founding\nmember, Belarus has always advocated strengthening\nthe role of the United Nations. In an era of\nglobalization, only an institutionally strong\nOrganization will be capable of making a genuinely\neffective contribution to coordinating member States'\nefforts to attain the noble goals enshrined in the\nCharter.\nAlthough there has not been much progress in the\nWorking Group on Security Council reform and on\nincreasing the Council's membership, Belarus\nwelcomes the progress made in improving its working\n24\n\nmethods by increasing transparency and having more\nopen meetings and briefings. Reform of the General\nAssembly is also speeding up, and informal\nconsultations should serve as a basis for effective work\nat this session.\nWe have been monitoring the work of the\nEconomic and Social Council, and we welcome\ninternal reforms there. We support more interaction\nbetween the Economic and Social Council, the Security\nCouncil and the General Assembly. We welcome the\ncoordinating role of the Council as set forth in the\nCharter and the Millennium Declaration.\nAs we look at what we have done and what\nremains to be done, we inevitably reach the conclusion\nthat there is little time for thought due to the speed at\nwhich the world is changing today; therefore, we\nbelieve that the only key to success is to purposefully\nmove forward to solve specific tasks. Belarus will work\ntogether with other member States to that end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffSome\n50 years ago my predecessor Paul-Henri Spaak said\nbefore the Assembly, in a phrase that stands out in our\nminds, \u201cWe are afraid\u201d. At that time, totalitarianism\nthreatened democratic freedoms and our open society\nwas in danger. Fortunately, political and diplomatic\ndialogue gradually won out over confrontation, mutual\nthreats and force. The advent of a freer world, more\nunited and more respectful of everyone is finally within\nour grasp. After September 2001, all democratic forces\nthroughout the world felt a moment of fear, terror,\nconfusion and horror at the barbaric violence that\nsmashed their strongest beliefs into pieces. That\nirrational hatred threatened the same democratic\nvalues, fundamental freedoms and humanistic world\noutlook.\nThe free world came together with a sense of\nsolidarity, compassion and survival. A coalition against\nthat vile crime stood side by side with the people of the\nUnited States. We felt it was our duty; we felt that their\nsuffering was our suffering and that their cause was\nalso our cause. We could not permit there to be any\ndoubt in the minds of the enemies of our shared values;\nwe could not leave any scope for those who sought to\nbreak the promise of a world of justice, progress and\npeace.\nToday we must move beyond fear. Our response\nmust be guided by clear-minded analysis and rational\naction. The enemy is faceless but is not everywhere.\nWe all are now constantly vigilant, but must not reach\nthe point of being unable to look one another in the eye\nwithout mistrust or suspicion. We are in an infinitely\ngreat majority; only an infinitesimal minority is against\nus. We cannot simply reduce the entire world to a\nbattlefield. We cannot simply make a division between\ngood and evil. To build a wall would be to fall into the\ntrap of those who openly display their hate and\nintolerance. Instead, more than ever we must realize\nthat the source of wealth and hope in the world is\nprecisely its great diversity and pluralism.\nThe struggle against terrorism must, of course, be\nbased on effective methods with no room for laxity. I\nwant to make this point very strongly: fighting\nterrorism must not lead us to distort the nature of\ndemocratic tolerant life or respect for the rule of law.\nPreserving our concept of a pluralist, open and tolerant\nsociety must be our goal. We cannot be misled or\naccept distortions of our firm belief in the fundamental\nhuman rights and the rights of peoples. Combating\nterrorism also means, above all, that we must defend\nthe fundamental rights and legal protections of every\nman and woman. We have a humanist conviction and\nwe must defend it, because otherwise we would be\nceding victory to the terrorists. It would also be a\n2\n\nmistake to believe that the fight against terrorism can\nbe won by military means alone. Military means are\nadmittedly necessary, but are not themselves enough to\nput an end to this horrible phenomenon.\nThere is absolutely nothing that can justify\nterrorism. No cause can justify terror. I categorically\nand definitively reject the idea that we have to look to\nthe inequities of the world for the source of this\nperversion of the mind and soul. In my view, that\nwould mitigate this abominable act. The origin of the\nattack cannot be found there. However, we also know\nthat misery, injustice, poverty, exclusion and\nhumiliation create fertile ground for extremism,\nintolerance and hatred to flourish by taking advantage\nof the hopelessness and suffering of those left behind\nby a society too quickly satisfied by its clear\nconscience.\nWhy should we deny it? As our Prime Minister\nGuy Verhofstadt has said, in less than a year we have\nfocused at least four times on the challenges facing the\nworld: at Doha, Monterrey, Rome and Johannesburg.\nThe elimination of poverty, debt reduction and\nliberalization of international trade as a factor for\ndevelopment are all questions that have been\nrepeatedly discussed. We all come to the same\nconclusions. We identify the same causes. I am certain\nthat we all know the solutions that must be applied.\nWith such unanimity, it should be easy to put an\nend to inequality. It should be easy to bring together a\nworld which for too long has been cut in two, a world\nthat generates tensions and frustrations. There cannot\nand should not be a superficial division at the margin\nof our wealth. We need a loftier conception of\ncooperation, one that derives not from paternalism but\nrather from partnership and mutual respect.\nPutting an end to inequality and forging a new\nsolidarity is the way to ensure sustainable development\nfor future generations. At each of our summits, the rich\nworld has raised the hopes of the millions of indigent\npeople who are searching for a glimmer of light in the\ndarkness. However, each time, at the end of these grand\nmeetings, when the speeches are over, when those who\nadvocate on behalf of the poor have stopped their\nritualistic pleadings, poverty remains in place. One gets\nthe impression that we have offered those who\nexpected so much of us only empty rhetoric and\nposturing.\nThe Millennium Goals must become a benchmark\nfor all the work of the United Nations and for that of\neach of its Member States. We have to translate them\ninto financial tools and into access to markets and\ntechnology. At Monterrey, my country pledged to reach\nthe target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for\ndevelopment cooperation by 2010. We have offered,\nfurthermore, new initiatives on the debt burden.\nI also attach paramount importance to follow-up\nof the Durban Conference against racism, and to the\nimplementation of the Durban Programme of Action.\nCombating racism, discrimination and intolerance is\nabsolutely essential for the millions of human beings\nwho have often silently suffered from infringements on\ntheir dignity. I stress the historic importance of the\nagreement on the origins and causes of racism. It forms\nthe basis of a new partnership. Unless we recognize\npast injustices, we will not have a solid basis for future\nefforts.\nAnother challenge that we wish to address is to\nattain absolute gender equality. This is absolutely\nessential in a civilization of progress, in which our\nideals of democracy and humanism are realized. The\nSecretary-General and his team, including his Deputy,\nLouise Fr\u00e9chette, can count on my country's\ncommitment and support for all the reforms under way.\nWe must revitalize the General Assembly, continue the\nstrengthening of the Economic and Social Council,\nexpand the Security Council and carry out\norganizational reforms. I know that the United Nations\nwill take up these challenges.\nThe outstanding and far-sighted speech made by\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan rightly, skilfully and\nresolutely reminded us what, in the final analysis, is the\nmeaning of the world government and parliament. He\nmade his statement very convincingly and intelligently.\nWe share his view on reshaping our Organization so\nthat it can live up to our ambitions.\nMy country was at the forefront of combating\nimpunity for the most serious crimes and for the rapid\ndevelopment of a true international criminal justice.\nThat is why we continue to support the\ninternationalization of the Rome Statute, and why we\nare resolved to preserve its integrity. Admittedly, we\nknow that the dialogue is never easy when law interacts\nwith politics, but we are convinced that in the long-\nterm, nothing will block society's right to demand\njustice when the most serious crimes against\n3\n\nfundamental values are committed. States have primary\nresponsibility for prosecuting the crimes covered in the\nStatute of the Court. We urge the world community,\nincluding the most powerful among us, to give the\nCourt credibility and resources commensurate with its\nlofty mission.\nConflict prevention is one of my country's\nforeign policy priorities. We are engaged concretely in\npreventive diplomacy, particularly in Central Africa,\nwhere Belgium is proactively supportive of the Lusaka\nand Arusha peace processes. Belgium actively\nadvocates this approach within the European Union.\nBelgium is seeking to make this concept of conflict\nprevention, conflict management and post-conflict\nsupport an essential part of international doctrine. We\nneed standing monitoring and warning mechanisms to\nalert us in time to crises. Such mechanisms could spare\nthe lives of many people. For similar reasons, we need\nto develop a real strategy against the illegal financing\nof conflicts and the related illegal trade in natural\nresources. The sordid exploitation of such resources \u2014\nfor instance, conflict diamonds \u2014 too often contributes\nto finance or at least prolong regional tragedies such as\ncivil wars and inter-ethnic conflicts.\nTo face this challenge, a credible international\nmonitoring system, based on common standards, has to\nbe established. Substantial improvements must be\nmade in the functioning of the various sanctions\ncommittees, and we believe that a single monitoring\nbody, with a long-term mandate, should be set up.\nAfrica is at the centre of our concerns, but also of\nour hopes. The creation of the African Union during\nthe Durban summit of the Organization of African\nUnity, along with the dynamic of the New Partnership\nfor Africa's Development (NEPAD), are major steps\nforward taken in recent months. The strengthening of\ndemocracy and the recent successful elections in Africa\nare an encouraging sign. The prospects for Africa also\ninclude regional integration of African countries,\nwhich we encourage. We can see some positive but still\nfragile signs with regard to reconciliation in countries\nthat have been too long devastated by conflicts, such as\nthe Great Lakes region, Angola and the Sudan.\nFurther efforts have been made this year to find a\nsolution to the conflict in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo. The inter-Congolese dialogue has led, first,\nto the signing of a partial agreement at Sun City, which\ncreated a dynamic of reconciliation, thanks to the\nefforts of South Africa, to which I pay tribute here. The\nPretoria Agreement addresses the main causes of the\nconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: its\nterritorial integrity and the security concerns of\nRwanda. The United Nations Organization Mission in\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo has a crucial\npart to play in ensuring implementation of the\nAgreement, with its operation to disarm and demobilize\nthe armed groups.\nI urge Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo to take advantage of this opportunity to\nrestore to their peoples the peace and prosperity they\ndeserve. I would also like to pay tribute to the Special\nEnvoy of the Secretary-General, Mr. Niasse, for\nbringing all the Congolese parties to the negotiating\ntable with a view to arriving at a democratic, inclusive\nagreement.\nThrough the many meetings I have attended in the\nregion, I have become acquainted with Congolese\npolitical figures. I know that they have the will, the\nauthority, the competence and the grasp of history to\nrealize the dream of peace and prosperity of a\npopulation which has suffered for too long.\nI should like also to pay tribute to the South\nAfrican and Tanzanian mediation in the context of\nnegotiations for a ceasefire in Burundi. Despite the\nprogress made, there has been a resumption of violence\nthat could undermine the gains recorded in the Arusha\nprocess \u2014 so ably facilitated by the political and moral\nauthority of President Nelson Mandela. I would also\nurgently appeal to all international partners to consider\nwhich concrete steps should be taken to help Burundi\nemerge from its political, economic and social crisis.\nThe difficulties prevailing in this area are without a\ndoubt complicating the political solution.\nAnother area in need of structural stability is the\nMiddle East. Men, women, mothers, fathers, children\nall are suffering on a daily basis from the violence, and\nfor this reason we must reaffirm those principles that\nwill enable us to find a lasting and equitable solution:\nland for peace, a viable Palestinian State and security\nfor Israel. Rather than going beyond the gains made\nthrough Oslo and Madrid, we should enshrine and\nreconfirm them by translating them into reality. This is\nwhat the European Union has sought to do by drawing\nup a road map setting out the actions to be taken by the\nparties concerned with a view to achieving a\ncomprehensive and lasting solution.\n4\n\nLastly, let me ask a question that I think is of\nglobal significance. The question of Iraq is a challenge\nto all of us, because it involves questions at several\ndifferent levels: the need to eliminate a major threat to\nthe international community; the need to ensure the\ncredibility of our Organization; the need to determine\nwhether a country has weapons of mass destruction that\ncan bring death to millions of people; the need to\ndetermine if a country is failing to meet its obligations\nto the United Nations; and the need to know if a\npreventive unilateral military action is or is not a\ndoctrinal problem under international law.\nAll of these questions are core issues with respect\nto our Organization, its missions and its individual and\ncollective political responsibilities.\nI wish to recall that each and every one of us, in\nsigning the Charter of the United Nations, solemnly\nundertook to comply with that Charter. Therefore, on\nbehalf of my country and of its citizens, I wish to make\na clear appeal to Iraq. I formally and solemnly ask the\nIraqi authorities to implement urgently and\nunconditionally the resolutions adopted by the United\nNations. Respect for our Organization and respect for\nwhat we are, collectively and individually, is the only\nway of avoiding recourse to force. I ask the Iraqi\nauthorities to seize this last opportunity.\nAll of these challenges require a united,\nmultilateral reaction in a spirit of solidarity. The world\nis a village now, but too often we are rather narrow-\nminded and do not listen to one another. Sometimes the\nother is seen as a stranger or even an intruder. Human\ncivilizations must learn more about one another in\norder to live together in harmony.\nThe citizens of the world have different\nperspectives on life, on religion, on the way they\norganize their society, on the past and the future. But\nthey all dream of justice, happiness and equality. Often\nthey dream the same dream, but the path to\nimplementing that dream sometimes varies. Respecting\nothers even though they are different will help us move\ntowards a more harmonious world. This is what we, as\npolitical leaders, have a responsibility to do, in order to\nbroaden day after day the common area of the values\nthat we share.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to begin\nby congratulating you, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh\nsession, and to wish you success in your work. I would\nalso like to thank Mr. Han Seung-soo for having so\nably conducted the work of the fifty-sixth session.\nIt is with special pleasure that I welcome the\nadmission of the Swiss Confederation to the United\nNations. That we have the pleasure and the opportunity\nto welcome such a new Member \u2014 a long-standing\ndemocracy which has only recently chosen to enter this\nforum \u2014 is continuing testimony to the vitality,\nviability and relevance of this unique body.\nThis time last year, new States and old were\nthunderstruck by a terror that is still indescribable. We\nwere reeling from the enormity of what terrorism had\nwrought, even as we sought to understand why it had\nhappened. Millenniums of experience of the\ndevastation of war had not provided us with the tools\nnecessary to understand that new form of combat.\nToday, a year later, as we persevere with the\narduous endeavour to eradicate the affliction, we also\ncontinue to search for causes. We distinguish, certainly,\nbetween comprehending and concurring, awareness and\nacquiescence, understanding and justification. At the\nsame time, we recognize that diagnosis does not always\nresult in a cure.\nWe cannot go back to where we were a year ago,\neither in our assumptions or in our actions. The\nfundamental question we must all answer is: what is it\nthat we can and cannot, should and should not, do to\nother human beings? The answer must include a\nrejection of flagrant injustice and abject poverty. That\nwould go a long way towards alleviating the\nhopelessness that perpetuates such societal ills.\nBearing that in mind, we welcome the targets and\ntimetables adopted to spur action on a wide range of\nissues at the recently concluded World Summit on\nSustainable Development. Critical among those goals\nis the need to provide and manage water as a basic\nelement of life and a basic requirement for dignified\nliving. Without that, neither economic nor political\nstability is possible. The other two major United\nNations events of this year \u2014 the International\nConference on Financing for Development and the\nspecial Assembly session on children \u2014 also\ndemonstrate that social and economic development\nmust be tackled in tandem in order to attain global\npeace and security.\nIn Armenia, too, we are focusing on both aspects\nof development. The Armenian Government's poverty\nreduction strategy aims to establish an umbrella for the\nformulation and implementation of sustainable human\ndevelopment strategies in areas damaged by\nearthquakes and conflict. We shall do that by building\ndomestic capacities for governance and by restoring\nsocial services in education and health, agricultural\ndevelopment, reforestation and disaster preparedness.\nArmenia's response to the very special session on\nchildren is the elaboration and implementation of its\nNational Plan of Action for Children. The National\nPlan of Action sets 10-year goals for the protection of\nthe rights of the child, outlines principal strategies, and\nestablishes indicators and mechanisms for monitoring\nprogress towards the enumerated goals.\nThe past decades of summits and forums on the\nvariety of social and economic ills that face modern\nsocieties have amply demonstrated that committed\npartnerships are necessary for serious progress. At\nhome, Government and civil society must work\ntogether to implement the decisions of such forums,\nbut, at the global level, Governments and international\nagencies must also provide the resources and impetus\nfor their universal agendas.\nEconomic prosperity hinges on internal, regional\nand international stability. That stability, in turn,\ndepends on cooperation and goodwill. In our region,\ndespite the existence of various conflicts, we continue\nto be hopeful that democratic processes will create civil\nsocieties with responsible leaders committed to the\nresolution of political issues.\nIn Armenia, we look forward to a year of\nelections: presidential elections \u2014 the fourth held since\n7\n\nindependence \u2014 will be followed by parliamentary\nelections, which in turn will be followed by a\nreferendum on constitutional reforms. We are proud\nthat we have had a working Constitution for more than\nseven years, and that that Constitution has seen us\nthrough difficult periods without leading to domestic\nturmoil. Nevertheless, we recognize the need \u2014 as in\nany evolving society \u2014 to make some changes in order\nto reflect more accurately our commitment to\nbecoming a society that respects the rule of law and the\nrights of individuals.\nWe are equally proud that the Armenians of\nNagorny-Karabakh, in the midst of their ongoing\nstruggle for self-determination, have also completed\nanother presidential election cycle. Indeed, the people\nof Nagorny-Karabakh deserve to be commended for\nestablishing the rule of law despite continuing adverse\nsocial and economic conditions.\nAs the Organization for Security and Cooperation\nin Europe (OSCE) and the Co-Chairmen of its Minsk\nGroup continue to work with Armenia, Azerbaijan and\nNagorny-Karabakh towards a settlement that will\nwisely \u2014 i.e. with an eye to the realities on the\nground \u2014 determine Nagorny-Karabakh's final status,\nit is self-evident that only a democratically elected\nleadership that enjoys a popular mandate will be able\nto participate actively and legitimately in the final\nnegotiations that affect the status of its own people.\nWith that in mind, in 1992, at the Helsinki Meeting of\nthe Council of Ministers of the Conference on Security\nand Cooperation in Europe, it was decided that elected\nand other representatives of Nagorny-Karabakh would\nbe invited to the Minsk Conference, entrusted with\ndetermining the final status of Nagorny-Karabakh.\nTherefore, while elections and democratization\ndo not presume a particular status, self-determination is\nalways more legitimate when accompanied by\ndemocratic processes. The international community\nseems to understand, often welcomes and sometimes\nassists in electoral democratic processes in areas whose\ninternational legal status is still in flux and ostensibly\nsubject to the sovereignty of an existing State. We do\nnot understand why such wise and non-prejudicial\napproaches or strategies should be denied to Nagorny-\nKarabakh, where de facto self-rule has already been in\nplace for almost 10 years.\nDemocratization and self-determination become\nboth necessary and inevitable when the formation of a\nnew independent entity takes place inside States that\nare deficient in democracy and whose respect for\nhuman rights and application of United Nations\nprinciples is unsatisfactory. Nothing demonstrates that\nfact more than East Timor's forthcoming membership\nin this body. So it is with pleasure that we express to\nthat country the heartfelt congratulations of the\nArmenian Government. East Timor's coming\nmembership is proof that a blanket rejection of claims\nto self-determination is invalid and does not take into\naccount the very real fact that such movements are not,\nby their nature, all alike or even similar. Different\nstruggles for self-determination have evolved in\ndecidedly different ways; therefore, each has to be\ntreated differently.\nThe challenge for the international community\ncontinues to be to adopt policies that will contribute to\nthe peaceful solution of each conflict. In order to adopt\ncorrect policies, criteria must be established by which\nto evaluate and judge each case on its own merit,\nrealistically taking into account the real situation on the\nground in order to attain lasting peace.\nThat peace is what the people of Nagorny-\nKarabakh and the whole region are still waiting for,\nand one would think that it is also what the leadership\nof Azerbaijan want. Based on the very hopeful\nmeetings that are taking place between the Presidents\nof Armenia and Azerbaijan, we have reasons to be\npositive. However, having followed the comments that\nmy colleague from Azerbaijan made this morning from\nthis podium, I am not only shocked but also dismayed\nthat he is not keeping pace with the progress being\nmade in the region by the Presidents of both our\ncountries.\nIt has been two years since the meetings at Paris\nand Key West, where the international community put\nforth their views on this issue. Since then, some\nAzerbaijani officials, out of desperation or ignorance,\nhave used every means at their disposal to discredit the\ninitiatives of the international community, looking for\nways to artificially link them to the critical issues of\nthe day.\nAfter 11 September, the talk of the threat of\ninternational terrorism caused Azerbaijan to make\naccusations that went full circle in damaging its own\nreputation when, according to Western sources,\nAzerbaijan's own 10-year-long relationship with\nterrorists came to the surface and it was demonstrated\n8\n\nthat Azerbaijan had indeed served as a regional\nterrorist hub. So that did not work. Today, as the\ninternational community speaks of countries'\nresponsibilities under Security Council resolutions,\nAzerbaijan frivolously makes the same accusation\nagainst Armenia, without considering that Armenia has\ndone exactly what the international community\nexpected: it has used its good offices, with the\nleadership of Nagorny-Karabakh, to help find a\npeaceful solution to the conflict.\nAzerbaijan has a choice: continue with crude\ndelusional manipulation and naive wishful thinking and\nhope for a return to a historical military and political\nsituation that ended long ago, or join the international\ncommunity, through the good offices of the Co-\nChairmen of the OSCE's Minsk Group, in order to\ncontinue in the difficult search for peace. The people\non the ground on all sides have demonstrated their\nreadiness for peace and for political and economic\nstability. Leaders at the highest level are maintaining\nthe honest dialogue that will chip away at political\nobstacles. We who are entrusted with transforming\nthose efforts and desires into a just peace must\napproach our task honestly and responsibly.\nLet me say that Nagorny-Karabakh has never,\never been a part of independent Azerbaijan. Whether\nwe consider history or geography, whether we adopt a\nlong-term political perspective or face the reality of the\nfacts on the ground, the men, women and children of\nNagorny-Karabakh have earned the right to live\npeacefully on their historic lands.\nI wish to take this opportunity to reiterate\nPresident Kocharian's statement before the General\nAssembly two years ago with respect to working for\nthe recognition of the Armenian genocide and\npreventing the repetition of such an atrocity. We extend\nour profound appreciation to all those Governments,\nlegislatures and international bodies that have\nrecognized the Armenian genocide and pledge our\ncooperation to all those that are currently in the process\nof reaffirming the facts of that crime against humanity.\nAs a signatory of the Convention on the Prevention and\nPunishment of the Crime of Genocide, the Armenian\nGovernment places a high priority on the struggle to\nprevent future genocide and to stand up against all\nattempts to deny past genocide. We support all\ninitiatives that reinforce the international consensus\nbehind that landmark treaty.\nIt is becoming clear that this millennium, too,\nwill not be violence-free. Today, when global peace\nappears a distant hope, Armenia observes the volatility\nin the Caucasus, the Middle East and elsewhere with\ntrepidation. To face such challenges, Armenia supports\nproposals by the Secretary-General aimed at the\nstrengthening of the Organization so that it can face\nnew challenges in a more satisfactory way.\nAdditionally, Armenia is in favour of more equitable\nrepresentation on the Security Council, as well as more\ntransparency in its activities.\nThe situation in the Middle East, in Afghanistan\nand around Iraq remains a continuing example of the\nneed for a vibrant and strengthened United Nations\nable to assert the will of the Organization's\nmembership and empowered with greater authority to\nimplement its decisions.\nAs States and Governments continue to search for\nnew ways to deal with emerging internal conflicts and\nincreasingly complex interrelationships, Armenia is of\nthe belief that the United Nations must stand for all the\neasy-to-orate but difficult-to-deliver principles of\neconomic and political justice and equality among\npeoples. Given our uneven history and problematic\ngeography, it is no surprise that Armenia is an advocate\nof multilateralism and collective security. From the\nvantage point of a country with our resources and\nlimitations, we realize that peace is not possible\nwithout social justice, sustainable development and\nrespect for the rights of all individuals and peoples in\nthe community of nations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI congratulate you, Sir,\non your election as President of the General Assembly.\nOur annual gatherings in this great Hall serve\nwell to reaffirm our commitment to the purposes of the\nUnited Nations: the commitment to uphold the\nprinciples of the Charter, to assert fundamental human\nrights and freedoms as we seek to improve social and\neconomic conditions, and to act together in sovereignty\nin the maintenance of international peace and security.\nThe lessons of history require that nations be united in\ncommon effort. There is no other way; not today, in\nthis interdependent, ever globalizing world. Certainly,\nfrom the perspective of the very small there is no other\nway. Indeed, we cannot see how any one country, no\nmatter what its size and power, can completely fend for\nitself.\nWar and conflict divide nations. They rage in too\nmany places. Global forces operate to degrade the\nenvironment and spread misery through poverty and\ndisease and through the illicit trade in arms, drugs and\npeople. The entire world community is now seriously\nchallenged by the terrible scourges of HIV/AIDS and\nterrorism. Only through cooperation and multilateral\naction can we hope to respond, to take\ncountermeasures, to find solutions and to give\nprotection to all.\nThe monstrous terrorist attacks on the United\nStates on 11 September 2001 were an assault on values\nthat are fundamental to humanity and to the United\nNations. On behalf of my country, I want to renew to\nthe people of the United States our feelings of\nsolidarity and total support. The spirit of the United\nStates was never in doubt. Tested, it has become more\nresolute in its purpose and courage. It is that spirit that\nprovides global leadership. It is the spirit that unites us\nall in the struggle against terrorism.\nLet me reaffirm our strong support for Security\nCouncil resolution 1373 (2001) and for the Council's\naction to implement it. For its part, Samoa has put in\nplace appropriate policies and domestic legislation, and\nwe will review our arrangements as necessary, in\nkeeping with the work of the Counter-Terrorism\nCommittee.\nIraq continues to violate Security Council\nresolutions. It has done so for a considerable time \nfar too long. We commend Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan for his repeated efforts to encourage\ncompliance. We think there must be full compliance\nwith obligations pursuant to Security Council\nresolutions: compliance without preconditions, without\ndelay.\nWe welcome the broad acknowledgement in the\nstatements we have heard in this debate that actions\nthat need to be taken will be taken within the\nframework of the United Nations and under the\nauthority of the Security Council. The news this\nmorning of the likely return of weapons inspectors is a\npositive development, and we hope it is one of\ncomplete seriousness.\nOur concern about Iraq reflects in part our very\nserious concern about the proliferation of weapons of\nmass destruction  chemical, biological and nuclear\nweapons. Those weapons pose an immediate and major\nthreat to international peace and security. The\ninternational agreements and systems to control the\ndevelopment and spread of weapons of mass\ndestruction, and to eliminate them, must be\nstrengthened and implemented.\nWe live in a part of the world where nuclear\nweapons have been tested and used. Our fear of the\nconsequences is real. That is why we have the\nRarotonga Treaty, which declared the South Pacific a\nnuclear-weapon-free-zone. We call on States that have\nnot yet done so to complete the ratification process of\nthe protocols to the Treaty. And that is why we\ncontinue to object to the transportation of nuclear and\nother radioactive material through the waters of our\nregion.\n8\n\nWe are appalled at the suffering of families and\ncommunities in the Middle East, and we pray for\npermanent peace for all. The current situation is a\nthreat of utmost gravity to international peace and\nsecurity. It calls for efforts of highest priority and\nurgency to bring an end to the conflict. Security\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973) and 1397\n(2001) provide the basis for a settlement. Those\nresolutions should be implemented.\nMy delegation strongly supports the Secretary-\nGeneral in the ongoing reform of the United Nations.\nWe have all seen good and positive results. Reform to\nmake the General Assembly and the Economic and\nSocial Council more effective must continue. Reform\nof the Security Council calls for particular attention.\nThe issues are sensitive and complex. That is clear.\nYet, it is also clear that the Security Council needs to\nreflect the geopolitical realities of our time. It needs to\nbe properly representative of the international\ncommunity of today and to be able to function\neffectively and be secure in its authority.\nWe applaud the entry into force of the Rome\nStatute that established the International Criminal\nCourt. Samoa has now ratified the Statute. The Court\nwill bring to justice those who commit genocide,\ncrimes against humanity and war crimes. It is,\ntherefore, a major achievement and a significant step in\nthe protection of human rights and in upholding\ninternational humanitarian standards. To that end, the\nCourt deserves all support to allow it the strength of\nuniversality and the rule of law. We need to ensure that\nit is not undermined in any way.\nThis has been an especially notable year in the\ninternational efforts to realize the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals. In March, we achieved the\nMonterrey Consensus. Earlier this month, we agreed in\nJohannesburg on a Plan to implement sustainable\ndevelopment in every land. Rightly, the focus is on\nhalving extreme poverty by 2015. The condition of\nutter misery that condemns so many of our fellow\nhumans worldwide is simply unacceptable. The\noutstanding leadership of South Africa ensured the\nsuccess of the Johannesburg Summit. We extend to\nPresident Mbeki, to his ministers and to his other\ncolleagues our warm thanks and congratulations.\nIn this context, let me also congratulate the\nleadership of Africa on the establishment of the\nAfrican Union and the creation of the New Partnership\nfor Africa's Development (NEPAD). We have joined\nhands with Africa on other issues, including our\nendeavours in the context of cooperation between the\nGroup of African, Caribbean and Pacific States and the\nEuropean Union, and I give assurance of our close\ninterest and support.\nSpeaking in Samoa's capacity as Chairman of the\nAlliance of Small Island States, let me note our\nparticular satisfaction with the provisions in the\nJohannesburg Plan of Implementation dedicated to the\nsustainable development of small island States. We\ngreatly appreciate the role played by all countries in\nfinding agreement on those provisions. We look\nforward to their continuing support as we move to\nprepare for the agreed international meeting in 2004 to\nreview the Barbados Programme of Action.\nOvercoming the well-recognized vulnerability of small\nisland States, and the exposure of island countries to\nthe effects of global climate change, natural disasters,\nenvironmental damage and global economic shocks is\nfundamental to long-term sustainability in all small\nisland regions.\nClimate change poses immediate and the most\nserious of threats for our communities. Largely by the\nacts of others, it puts at risk countries like my own that\nare least responsible for the causes and least able to\nadapt. In Johannesburg, we were greatly heartened by\nthe declarations from many countries  the Russian\nFederation, China, India and Canada among them  of\ntheir plans to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. This serious\nproblem deserves no less than this type of global\nsolidarity and leadership.\nAs I close, let me welcome Switzerland upon its\nhaving taken up full membership of the United\nNations. Switzerland's role and its contribution to the\nOrganization are known to all and are well appreciated.\nLet me also voice our satisfaction with the\nsituation in East Timor. It is a success story in every\nsense: in the determination of its people and in the\nresponse of the international community. Samoa is\npleased to have been able to contribute to the United\nNations peacekeeping effort in that country; we plan to\ncontinue doing so. Last month, we welcomed East\nTimor as an observer to the Pacific Islands Forum. We\nlook forward to its joining the United Nations soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffA year ago the entire world\nwatched in horror as terror was visited on the city that\nplays host to the United Nations. It is a city that has\nwelcomed people from all corners of the world for\nhundreds of years and that still remains for many an\nirresistible magnet as a place of opportunity.\nWe watched  all of us, from our different parts\nof the world  as the terrible events unfolded. If there\nhad been any doubt before, that experience convinced\nall of us that our world had indeed become a global\nvillage. Modern technology enabled all of us\nsimultaneously to watch the events as they unfolded.\nThe devastation and drama of those events have since\nforcefully brought grief to our individual hearts, across\ncontinents, races, religions and political ideologies. If\never there was any doubt about mankind's shared\nhumanity, that catastrophe conclusively dispelled it.\nA year on, we still bear the deep scars; we have\nnot forgotten, and we dare not forget, because what\nhappened was not directed exclusively against New\nYork and the people of the United States. Nationals of\nmany countries, including Ghanaians, perished in that\ntragedy. What happened was indeed an affront to\ncivilization itself.\nThroughout the ages, whenever humanity has\nfound itself confronted with great danger, it is the sense\nof unity and common purpose that has pulled us\nthrough. This is no exception. Indeed, the resilience of\nNew York and of the people of the United States has\nbrought about a spirit of solidarity and generosity that\nis just as awesome to behold as the tragic event itself.\nIt is for that reason that I am optimistic about the\nfuture. The work of the United Nations and of non-\ngovernmental organizations, and the growing\nacceptance of the principles of good governance,\nhuman rights, tolerance for a diversity of views and the\nrule of law around the globe make me optimistic. In my\nmind's eye, I can already see, in the near future, a\nworld in which there is more openness, more\nforbearance and less categorization of mankind.\nOur nations have been brought together by\nscience, technology and conscience, as well as by\n4\n\nadversity, and the acknowledgement of\ninterdependence among peoples has become a reality.\nNow we are moving from the concept of beggar thy\nneighbour' to one of prosper thy neighbour', which\nshould become the hallmark of the global village.\nSadly, the continent of Africa still lags behind in\nmany spheres, as poverty and disease plague the\ncontinent. But there is a new spirit abroad among the\nAfrican countries. Africa has never wanted to be\nperceived as the scar on the conscience of the world'.\nWe do not want to be the object of pity and charity, and\nwe do not want to provide the grisly images of war,\ndisease, ignorance, famine and poverty for the world's\ntelevision screens. It was largely as a result of our\ndetermination to shed that unacceptable image that\nmany a country on the continent, on attaining\nindependence, desperately rushed into one or another\nuntried ideology or economic model that tended only to\nworsen the woes of self-doubt left by exploitative and\nunconscionable colonialism.\nToday, under the auspices of the African Union,\nthe rejuvenated continental grouping, our countries\nhave resolved to tackle the continent's problems to\nenable us join the mainstream of world development.\nWe have pledged to endeavour to be honest with each\nother, and under the Peer Review Mechanism there will\nbe no hiding behind claims of sovereignty in order to\ntolerate abuses of human rights in individual countries.\nWe are determined to strive for democracy and\ngood governance, not because those are fashionable\nbuzzwords but because we are convinced that they are\nthe surest  if not always the most rapid  path to the\ndevelopment that we require to uplift the conditions of\nlife of our peoples.\nThe technology exists and the human expertise\nabounds in the world to end the degrading poverty and\ndebilitating diseases that sap the confidence of the\npeoples of Africa. This world Assembly must rally to\nhelp Africa in its genuine efforts to tap into the\nintellectual, financial and moral resources of the globe,\nto be a worthy partner within it. The concept of the\nNew Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD)\nprovides the framework within which African countries\ncan be assisted to become part of the mainstream. It\nprovides a great opportunity for world leaders to move\nfrom rhetoric to purposeful action.\nEducation has served as a route out of poverty for\npeople throughout the ages, and it should be the way\nout for us in Africa as well. We have an essentially\nyoung population that is ready and anxious to learn.\nFortunately, information and communications\ntechnology provides the means to help Africa leap-frog\ninto the modern world. Let the world community\ntherefore assist Africa to join in the mastery of this\npowerful tool.\nOurs is a well-endowed continent. Our raw\nmaterials keep the manufacturing engines of the world\nrunning. The reasons for investing in Africa, therefore,\nneed not be charitable; investment can be based on\nsound economic considerations. The market potential\nof a thriving and economically viable Africa will do\nwonders not only for Africa but also for the world\neconomy at large.\nI am optimistic, because I think of what Ghana\nand the African continent have contributed to the\ndevelopment of the world. We have provided, and\ncontinue to provide, personnel in various fields to all\nkinds of institutions in the world. Ghanaian academics\nand citizens from many other African countries can be\nfound in many top universities and companies around\nthe world, contributing significantly to the\ndevelopment of cutting-edge enterprises. Africans are\nin various jobs and are making a considerable\ncontribution to the running of organizations, including\nthe United Nations. I would like to take this\nopportunity to express Ghana's  and Africa's \ndeepest gratitude to the international community for\nthe confidence it showed in re-electing Mr. Kofi\nAnnan, the Secretary-General, to a second term.\nIn all these endeavours, however, the missing link\nfor Africa has been the solid and sustainable\nframework for good governance to support the\npurposeful evolution of prosperous and stable nations\non the continent. It is for this reason that Ghana, like\nother African nations, is trying to put its house in order\nto take advantage of emerging prospects. We are\nnurturing our infant democracy, and the citizens are\npassionately committed to the defence of the\nConstitution. We are putting in place mechanisms to\nsupport good governance. The institutional framework\nis being created to ensure an efficient public sector that\ncan interface effectively with an enterprising private\nsector to create wealth and eliminate poverty.\nBut Ghana, like other developing countries,\ncannot alone achieve the dramatic rate of growth that is\nrequired; there must be significant injections of outside\n5\n\ninvestment into our economy. We need affordable and\nsustainable sources of energy to be able to achieve\nrapid development. We need the partnership, markets\nand support of the international community to sustain\nour development. That is the message of NEPAD. We\nare working to develop a positive economic\nenvironment to receive and integrate foreign direct\ninvestment as a tool for regional development. That is\nthe sure path for Africa to connect effectively with the\nglobal markets.\nGhana acknowledges its share of responsibility to\nprotect the resources that Nature has given our country\nas the heritage of all humankind. The world cannot and\nmust not operate on the basis of the survival of the\nfittest. Weaknesses caused by history and other factors\nmust be taken into account and, above all, our common\nhumanity must inform all our international dealings.\nGhana sees a lot of potential in globalization. We\nwish to recommend, however, that an organization such\nas the United Nations should provide the regulatory\nframework to ensure that the benefits of globalization\nare more equitably distributed. The opportunities are\nenormous for those who can take advantage of the\nmove to more liberalized markets and increased flows\nof investment capital. But nature did not make all\npeople equally competitive. That global organization\nmust, therefore, evolve systems of safety nets to\nguarantee all humanity an acceptable minimum degree\nof dignity and respectability. The United Nations must\nrise up to this challenge.\nFor the pure and proper development of the\nglobal village, certain initiatives by this Organization\nmust be commended and encouraged. Ghana is in full\nsupport of United Nations effort to curb the illicit trade\nin small arms and light weapons. We urge Member\nStates to join in the early implementation of the\nProgramme of Action that was adopted in 2001 to stop\nthis trade, from which most of the instability in Africa\nstems.\nSecondly, women and children need our\nprotection. It is for that very reason that in Ghana we\nhave created a Ministry for Women and Children\u00ebs\nAffairs to enable us tackle issues that affect those two\ngroups. We have embarked on a vibrant educational\ncampaign and are pursuing policy initiatives that will\ncreate awareness and reduce the incidence of\ndiscrimination against women and help improve their\nlivelihoods. We are also striving to ban child labour\nand enforce free and compulsory education for all\nchildren up to the junior secondary school level as\nenjoined by Ghana\u00ebs national Constitution.\nThirdly, I must mention the HIV/AIDS pandemic,\nwhich is threatening the survival of our countries. The\nspread of the disease is compounding our difficulties\neven further. I wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-\nGeneral for his interest, and for the setting up of the\nGlobal Fund to help us fight the menace. The Ghana\nAIDS Commission is constantly seeking new ways to\nchange attitudes at all levels towards the disease, and\nwe seek to learn from the experience of others in\ncombating it. We support the efforts of the international\ncommunity to provide more affordable antiretroviral\ndrugs for the most needy.\nAt this stage, permit me to congratulate\nSwitzerland on its accession to membership, and East\nTimor on its forthcoming accession. That Switzerland\nhas at long last joined the Organization confirms its\nuniversality. They are welcome.\nThe tragedy of 11 September has certainly made a\ndifference to the world. It has shocked the world into\nuniting to condemn it. Let those of us who have\naccepted the honour and privilege to speak on behalf of\nour peoples determine that we must strive for a world\nof greater tolerance and of more justice, a more\nhumane world in which law and order are fully\nrespected both within nations and in the international\ncommunity. Eleven September must be used to\nunderpin the vital communal spirit that must motivate\nthe global village. We would then be able to say that\nwe had left the world a better place than we found it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the\nGovernment of the Republic of San Marino, I wish first\nto congratulate His Excellency Mr. Jan Kavan on his\nelection as President of the fifty-seventh session of the\nGeneral Assembly. I am convinced that his experience,\nprofessional skills and dynamism will contribute to the\nsuccess of our work. I also wish to thank Dr. Han\nSeung-soo for having presided over the General\nAssembly in one of the most difficult and delicate\nmoments of our recent history.\nInevitably, this session of the General Assembly\nis still suffering the consequences of a deep, indelible\nwound that, a little more than a year ago, was inflicted\non the whole of humanity, on the people who\ncontributed to creating this civilization and, in\nparticular, on a great and friendly nation, whose role\nhas always been crucial to the future of our planet.\nFeelings of pain and fright, but also rebellion, are\nstill vivid in the minds of each and every one of us.\nThe firm and absolute condemnation of what happened\nlast year in September remains unchanged and has been\nfurther strengthened by the determination to spare no\neffort in combating and if possible defeating the\ndreadful threat of terrorism, which is still present.\nHowever, San Marino is convinced that fighting\nterrorism exclusively through military, political and\neconomic actions is not enough. We must ask ourselves\nwhy terrorism comes about and develops, why\nfundamentalism and fanaticism exist, why some\nindividuals who proclaim to fight for the liberation of\nthe oppressed become instruments of death. We may\nhave found an answer, and that is why we keep on\nrepeating in all forums, that as long as the world is\nstricken by hunger, poverty, underdevelopment,\ninequality, oppression, ignorance and violations of\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, there will be\nno solution to all the political, economic and social\nsituations that are inexorably degenerating, which we\ncontinue to witness with a growing feeling of anguish,\nuncertainty and instability for a whole generation, for\nthe whole of mankind.\nWith that in mind, San Marino has fully\nsupported the initiatives and the procedures established\nby the Security Council to stem the expansion of\nterrorism. The Republic I represent has met in a timely\nmanner the requirements set forth by the Counter-\nTerrorism Committee established by the Security\nCouncil itself. In the same way, a number of legislative\nand financial measures on anti-terrorism adopted by\nSan Marino Parliament and Government are evidence\nof our will to proceed with the ratification of the\nrelevant international Conventions and of the intention\nto pass a special law to counter terrorism and its\nfinancing.\nWe also believe that dialogue and tolerance\namong all peoples of the world are further instruments\nto combat terrorism and fundamentalism. That calls not\nonly for effective political action, but also for a new\nculture to develop within peoples, where diversity\nbecomes a universal heritage, and leads to unity rather\nthan division, helps eliminate, rather than worsen,\ndisparities, brings different cultures, religions and\ntraditions closer together, rather than turning them into\ninstruments of incomprehension and confrontation.\nIt is a disgrace that a solution to the ongoing\nconflict and violence in the Middle East seems out of\nreach. Terrorist attacks and military reprisals further\nexacerbate hatred and revenge, undermining any\npossibility of promoting negotiations and dialogue on\nthe basis of mutual respect and protecting human rights\nand fundamental freedoms. San Marino is deeply\nconcerned about the worsening situation in this area\nand strongly condemns the spiral of violence plaguing\nthat region and indiscriminately causing victims every\nday, mainly among civilians, especially women and\nchildren.\nIsrael has the legitimate right to exist within its\nown borders and to defend and protect its own\npopulation. Palestinians have the same legitimate right,\nto live on their own land and the right to self-\ndetermination within their own State. Therefore, we\ndeem it imperative that both parties respect the rules of\ninternational law and fully comply with all United\nNations resolutions. Most recently, tensions have\nescalated further because of the possibility of a war\nagainst Iraq in order to remove its President, Saddam\nHussein.\nThe Republic of San Marino can certainly neither\ntolerate nor accept that the world be held hostage by\n15\n\nunscrupulous dictators who are absolutely unreliable\nand who are probably willing and able to jeopardize\ninternational security. Yet, any action, including\nmilitary intervention as a last resort, would in any case\nrequire the consensus and authorization of the United\nNations.\nThe international scene is marked on many fronts\nby dread and insecurity. Nonetheless, San Marino\nfollows with interest and supports the intensive activity\nthat the United Nations is conducting to tackle a\nnumber of issues with the ultimate goal of attaining a\nmore civilized, equitable, humane society fit for\nhumankind.\nWe followed with great attention the major\nconferences that the United Nations promoted and\norganized in 2002, especially those on children, the\nageing and sustainable development.\nThe twenty-seventh special session of the General\nAssembly on Children agreed that in order to\nimplement the principles enshrined in the Convention\non the Rights of the Child, it is imperative to attain\nthree major objectives: to guarantee children a decent\nstandard of living in a safe environment in which they\ncan grow up and develop physically, mentally and\nemotionally in a healthy manner; to ensure that they\ncan complete at least primary school; and to provide\nadolescents with the opportunity to strengthen their\nindividual capacities in a safe environment, so that they\nwill be able to fully participate in and contribute to the\nsociety in which they live. San Marino shares those\npriorities and has adopted a number of legislative,\nsocial and cultural initiatives to implement those\nfundamental principles.\nMy country also welcomes the activities carried\nout by the international community which, on the\noccasion of the Second World Assembly on Ageing\nheld last April in Madrid, adopted a political\ndeclaration and a new plan of action to safeguard the\ninterests and needs of the elderly, a population group\nwhich has so far probably been neglected although it\nwill considerably increase in number over the next few\nyears.\nSan Marino attaches great importance to the\nsignificant changes brought about by the Assembly in\nthe methods used to face and solve the problems of the\nageing population, while seeking to eradicate\nstereotypes and prejudices. We have a feeling that in so\ndoing, the international community has laid down the\nfoundations for a future plan of action that will ensure\nfor all human beings wellness, health and security in\nthe last years of their lives.\nAlso within the framework of the United Nations,\nalthough it had different objectives, the recent World\nSummit on Sustainable Development held in\nJohannesburg, South Africa was also of great\nimportance. San Marino is aware that the economic\ngrowth of the most developed nations must go hand in\nhand with economic growth at the global level.\nGlobalization, however, cannot be imposed. On the\ncontrary, it must be conceived as an opportunity for all\nStates and populations. It must facilitate access to\nmarkets for developing countries and promote targeted\ninvestments that take social and environmental\nconsiderations into account. At the same time, we have\nto build confidence and foster economic well-being to\nachieve the integration which we all deem to be\nessential. Such integration is also a precondition for the\nprotection of both the environment and cultural\ndiversity.\nI would like to recall that the Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court entered into force on 1\nJuly, 2002. With that formal achievement, the\ncommunity of States made a great leap forward in the\nprogress of international law, the Court being not only\na judicial institution created to prosecute genocide and\ncrimes against humanity, but also clear evidence of the\nwill existing at an international level to avoid granting\nimpunity \u2014 as is too often the case \u2014 to perpetrators\nof atrocious and intolerable crimes against peoples or\nindividuals.\nAs well, because of the role of guarantor assigned\nto that institution, the Republic of San Marino\nparticipated in the celebration of the fourth anniversary\nof the Court on 17 July, 2002 and was the first State in\nEurope to ratify its Statute. Furthermore, my\nGovernment believes that the International Criminal\nCourt does not in any way endanger the international\npeacekeeping forces. On the contrary, the Court further\nguarantees their protection through the articles of its\nStatute. For that reason, my country hopes that the\nInternational Criminal Court will be joined and\nsupported by as many countries as possible, and that\npractical solutions will be found that do not alter the\nStatute of Rome but that guarantee the continuity of\npeace operations.\n16\n\nOn this occasion, on behalf of the Government of\nSan Marino I feel it is my duty to reaffirm the\nimportance and the key role played by the General\nAssembly as the main decision-making and\nrepresentative body. Unquestionably, the functions of\nthe General Assembly and the effectiveness of its\ndecisions need strengthening. Moreover, the General\nAssembly should intensify its co-operation with the\nother United Nations bodies, primarily with the\nSecurity Council. A working group to which San\nMarino has also contributed ideas and proposals has\nbeen studying Security Council reform for eight years.\nAll Members probably know that San Marino has long\ntaken a stance in favour of an increase in the number of\nnon-permanent members on the Security Council,\nwhile it agrees neither with an increase in permanent\nseats nor with the extension of the right of veto. We\nconsider that this would have a positive effect on many\nactivities of the United Nations and therefore that it\nwould be beneficial to relations among and between\nStates; it is something which is now sorely needed.\nI wish to conclude by reasserting that the only\nway to overcome the consequences of the painful\nevents that we have recently experienced is to pool our\nefforts and to work together, honestly and actively, in\norder to start a virtuous cycle in which the objectives\nof civil and tolerant coexistence among peoples and\nnations are universally shared, supported and pursued;\nin which the values of solidarity, respect for human life\nand dignity dismantle the barriers of selfishness and\noppression; and in which democracy and freedom from\nall constraints and needs become effective.\nThese are the same objectives that a small State\ncalled the Republic of San Marino, which I have the\nhonour to represent here today in the most authoritative\nand prestigious international Organization, has sought\nto achieve over 17 centuries of history in a consistent,\npersistent but also humble manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The Luanda Agreement, signed on 6\nSeptember 2002, deals with the issue of the complete\nwithdrawal of Ugandan troops from the territory of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, as well as with\ncooperation and the normalization of relations between\nour two States.\nAlmost 45 days have passed since the signing of\nthe Pretoria Agreement \u2014 half of the time period set\nby the timetable for its implementation \u2014 without any\nsignificant progress having been made on the ground.\nThe commitment undertaken yesterday by the President\nof Rwanda to begin the withdrawal of troops as from\nnext week may mark a decisive phase in the\nimplementation of the Pretoria Agreement.\nFor its part, the Government of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, consistent with the\ncommitments that it has undertaken, had already\nassembled at Kamina more than 2,000 Rwandan ex-\ncombatants, who are awaiting repatriation to Rwanda.\nFurthermore, it has notified the third party, as of 5\nSeptember 2002, about additional information\nconcerning Rwandan ex-combatants.\nWith regard to the Luanda Agreement, it should\nbe noted that the withdrawal of Ugandan troops has\nbegun and that a joint peacemaking programme has\nbeen set up in the Ituri region.\nThe successful implementation of the Pretoria\nand Luanda Agreements, in particular with respect to\nthe withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan troops, will\nhave a clear impact on the conclusion of a\ncomprehensive and inclusive agreement in the context\nof the domestic political process aimed at national\nreconciliation and the reunification of the territory of\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, with a view to\nthe prompt holding of free, democratic and transparent\nelections at all levels.\nFollowing consultations with various political\nand social groups, as well as with the Special Envoy of\nthe Secretary-General for the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo, my Government suggested that\narrangements for the signing of an inclusive agreement\ncould begin at an early date.\nI would like now to turn to the particular and\nworrying situation that prevails in the eastern part of\nmy country. I am referring to the bloody and\ndistressing events that took place in Kisangani and\nBunia; the resumed fighting in the Kivu region; the\nrapes; the plundering of the wealth of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo; and all the other human rights\nviolations that have taken place. I also have in mind the\nappalling destruction of fauna, flora and the ecosystem\nin general in the eastern part of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo.\nI urgently appeal to the international community\nto put an end to this tragic situation, which is afflicting\nthe people of the eastern part of the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, and to ensure that the\nperpetrators of these vile and barbaric acts are punished\nand brought to justice.\nLikewise, we look forward eagerly to the\nconclusions of the Panel of Experts, which we hope\nwill be accompanied by proposals for sanctions to be\nimposed on those who are plundering the resources of\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo. This is the\nbleak situation that has been prevailing in my country\nfor more than four years; the socio-economic situation\nof the people has deteriorated as a result of the war,\nwhich has deprived my Government of more than half\nof its resources. In order to deal with this economic\ndisaster and to alleviate the suffering of our people as\nmuch as possible, a number of measures been in place\nfor more than a year. The tangible effects of these\npositive measures include the stabilization of our\ncurrency and of the price of major consumer goods, as\nwell as the resumption of cooperation with\ninternational financial institutions.\nIn the same spirit, a large-scale national\nreconstruction programme is under way, aimed at the\nrehabilitation of the basic social infrastructure so as to\npromote the recovery of the economy and the process\nof development.\n3\n\nI have condemned the terrorism and the tragic\nevents of 11 September 2001, which plunged the\nAmerican people and all of humankind into mourning.\nI have provided an updated review of the peace process\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in particular\nwith regard to the Pretoria and Luanda Agreements. I\nhave expressed my grave concern about the disturbing\nhumanitarian situation prevailing in the eastern part of\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is\ncharacterized by massacres and massive violations of\nhuman rights and international humanitarian law. I\nhave also pointed to the particularly difficult socio-\neconomic situation affecting the population of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, noting that it has\nbeen aggravated by war and its adverse effects. If the\nwar persists, the Government's efforts to achieve\neconomic recovery may well be completely nullified.\nIn order to put an end to this protracted tragedy, I\nearnestly appeal, through this Assembly, to the entire\ninternational community, to mobilize and become more\ndeeply involved in the quest for solutions to bring\nabout the reunification of our national territory and to\nreturn peace and stability to my country and to the\nwhole of the Great Lakes region.\nI would like to make several specific points. First,\nI believe that a conference should be held, under the\nauspices of the United Nations, on peace, security and\ndevelopment in the Great Lakes region. My country's\ndesire, in keeping with its African tradition, has always\nbeen to live in peace and harmony with all the States of\nAfrica and of the world, beginning with its neighbours.\nSecondly, the international community should be\nmore actively involved in resolving the conflict that is\ntearing the Democratic Republic of the Congo apart. It\nis clear today that the international community seems\nto be forgetting the role played by Africa in the\ndevelopment of today's wealthy States, and is showing\na degree of indifference to African issues.\nThirdly, the large number of Security Council\nresolutions which have, to date, remained\nunimplemented.\nFourthly, I am thinking of technical contributions\nand the mobilization of the international community to\nrehabilitate our ecosystem, so as to preserve this\nheritage of humankind.\nThe founding fathers of our universal\nOrganization, who were convinced that nations could\nbe brought together only through peaceful settlements\nof conflict, signed the Charter in order to ensure that no\narmed conflict would be a matter of indifference to the\nremainder of humanity. For this reason, the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, which believes deeply in the\nuniversal values championed by the United Nations,\nexpresses the hope that all the organs of the United\nNations will play their role to the fullest to ensure that\nwe may silence weapons wherever they are being used,\nin order to make peace a genuine right within the grasp\nof all of us.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffIt is a great honour and\nprivilege for me, as the first democratically elected\nPresident of Yugoslavia in nearly 60 years, to address\nthis gathering of world leaders. Against the solemn\nbackground of yesterday's commemoration and the\nchallenges that confront us, I would like to share with\nthe General Assembly my views on developments in\nSouth-East Europe.\nBefore I begin my remarks, allow me to express\nmy deep satisfaction at the election of Mr. Jan Kavan\nto preside over the fifty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly. His leadership and experience make him\nuniquely qualified to guide the extremely important\nwork of this body.\nI also wish to extend my congratulations to\nSwitzerland on joining the United Nations, and to\nTimor-Leste on its forthcoming accession to\nmembership.\nNearly two years have elapsed since democracy\nreturned to Yugoslavia \u2500 two years of concerted efforts\nby my country to alleviate the consequences of a\ndecade of civil war, build democratic institutions,\nestablish the rule of law, carry out market reforms and\nfulfil its obligations to the international community.\nAfter a 10-year delay, Yugoslavia has joined the large\ngroup of other European countries in transition that are\nbuilding their future on the common values of respect\nfor human rights, democracy, free-market economies\nand a commitment to European and Euro-Atlantic\nintegration.\nWhat distinguishes my country from most other\nCentral and Eastern European States is that during that\nsame decade Yugoslavia experienced the largest armed\nconflict in Europe since the Second World War. The\ndissolution of the former Yugoslavia, the civil wars\nwaged on its soil and the subsequent NATO bombing\nhave left continuing effects on the well-being of the\ncitizens of my country  and on that of the citizens of\nmost of South-East Europe. Yugoslavia knows only too\nwell that peace in the region, attained at great sacrifice,\nmust never be threatened again.\nThe efforts we have made to that end over the\npast two years, and the good political relations we have\nestablished with our neighbours, have strengthened my\nhope that an inter-State armed conflict in our region is\nunlikely to happen either today or in the foreseeable\nfuture. There are still threats to lasting peace in the\nworld and in the region alike. Those threats come from\nideological, religious, ethnic and political extremism,\nwhich fuel hatred and sow fear among our peoples.\nOrganized crime is often linked with that\nextremism, and is the lifeblood of terrorism. Even\nthough terrorism and organized crime in South-East\nEurope are rather specific in their characteristics, there\nare many links to leading terrorist and criminal groups\nthroughout the world. I am here to reaffirm my\ncountry's firm commitment to the struggle against this\nthreat. I am also confident that the United Nations is\nthe right place for the coordination of international\nefforts to rid the world of this evil. This struggle will\nnot be easy but, together, the community of democratic\nnations can prevail through cooperation and a unified\nresponse to potential threats, regardless of where they\nmay emanate from.\nIn addition to the security and military measures\nthat we undertake, we must also be equally committed\nto using other methods to eradicate the conditions that\nbreed terrorists. We must attack global poverty and\ninjustice throughout the world with the same\ncommitment and resolution with which we confront\nterrorism. We must reach out to the generation of\nyoung impoverished children, who are targets for\nterrorist recruitment and manipulation, by providing\nthem with hope through education and economic\nopportunity.\n6\n\nThe stabilization of our region requires\ncontinuous action not only by the States of the region\nbut also by the entire international community. My\ncountry has finally undertaken a constitutional\ntransformation, with facilitation by the European\nUnion, in order to define the relations between its two\nmember republics, Serbia and Montenegro. This will\nmake our integration with the rest of Europe easier and\nquicker. Our success requires the success of our\nneighbours. When it comes to Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nYugoslavia is a fervent advocate of the full\nimplementation of the Dayton Accords. In fact, we are\na guarantor of those Accords.\nAs in all other cases, our goal is to open borders,\nnot to change them. We want to promote the flow of\npeople and goods, thus restoring the broken ties that\nbound us to each other. I am pleased to see that this\npolicy has produced significant results, although I have\nto say that slow economic recovery hinders our efforts,\nespecially in the area of refugee returns. Yugoslavia, in\ncooperation with Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nwill continue to do its part in establishing the trust and\ncooperation between our three States that will benefit\nour citizens. I am proud that Yugoslavia will host the\nnext summit of these States, which is scheduled to be\nheld in Belgrade this autumn.\nI am saddened that the situation in Kosovo is far\nless encouraging. Some progress has been made since\nSecurity Council resolution 1244 (1999) was adopted,\nand since the United Nations Interim Administration\nMission in Kosovo (UNMIK) arrived in the province.\nWith the enormous help and understanding of\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, a bright spot was\nreached through the agreement with Special\nRepresentative Hans Haekkerup on cooperation\nbetween the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and\nUNMIK in November 2001. Unfortunately, Kosovo\nremains a factor of political instability and a centre for\norganized criminal networks that transit our region and\nstretch from Central Asia to South America. There is\nlittle doubt that these networks cooperate with\nextremist and terrorist groups in our region and\nbeyond.\nAnother problem with Kosovo is the desperate\nplight of the close to 250,000 Serbs, Montenegrins and\nother non-Albanians who desire to return to their\nhomes but who remain displaced, mostly in central\nSerbia. Unlike the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nless that one per cent of Kosovo's population of\ninternally displaced persons has returned. To make\nmatters worse, the fate of more than 5,000 abducted\nand missing persons is yet to be uncovered. During the\nlast two years, Kosovo's instability twice spilled over\ninto neighbouring areas, first into the Presevo valley in\nsouthern Serbia, and then into the western part of\nMacedonia. Regardless of the fact that Serbs and others\nparticipate in Kosovo's provisional institutions, this has\nnot led to an improvement in the security situation or\nto the establishment of complete freedom of\nmovement. Without immediate and noticeable\nimprovement in those two areas, a more massive return\nof internally displaced persons is unlikely. All of that,\nalong with the reluctance of Kosovo Albanian political\nleaders to enter into dialogue with us, makes is\nimpossible to begin a serious discussion on the final\nstatus of Kosovo.\nYugoslavia will continue to do its part in\nestablishing the conditions for a democratic and\npeaceful solution to this open issue. To that end, I am\npleased that we will upgrade to the ambassadorial level\ndiplomatic relations with our neighbour, the Republic\nof Albania. I am confident that the cooperation\nbetween our two countries will continue and that\njointly we will be in a better position to find solutions\nto outstanding problems.\nLet me stress that we are fully aware of our\ninternational commitments and that we will meet them,\nnot because this is demanded of us but because we\ndesire to establish a democratic society based on the\nrule of law.\nI believe that, at the conceptual level, the final\npoint I am going to make is the most important because\nit determines everything else. The world must\nunderstand that change has truly taken place in\nYugoslavia and that no authoritarian regime has any\nchance there anymore. Sometimes there is mistrust\ntowards my country; this is almost unbelievable. There\nis still prejudice against us, as if nothing has changed,\nwhereas actually a great deal has changed  and\nsubstantially. The political situation is still evolving.\nThere are still disagreements among the various\nplayers. But this is perfectly normal for a transitional\nperiod. Nothing should serve as a pretext for\ncontinuing a policy of conditionality towards us, or for\nattempts to interfere in our internal affairs. We\ncontinue often to see how such an approach is usually\ncounter-productive  not to mention the time it\nwastes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me at the\noutset to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the\npresidency of the General Assembly. I am confident\nthat you will guide us wisely through the complex tasks\nahead.\nI would also like to use this opportunity to\nwelcome Switzerland, our long-time friend and partner\nin the European Free Trade Association, to the United\nNations. Furthermore, I would like to express our\nsatisfaction that East Timor will be joining the United\nNations later this month. The independence of East\nTimor is one more example of how, in the end, the\npurposes and principles of the United Nations prevail.\nThe vicious and deliberately organized terrorist\nattacks against the United States on 11 September of\nlast year have had global implications. The necessity to\nfight terrorism and the international commitment and\ndetermination to do so have dominated the\ninternational arena in the past year. Iceland reaffirms\nits commitment to cooperate with the United Nations\nand its Member States, as well as with other relevant\ninternational organizations, in the fight against\nterrorism. To that end, we stress the importance for\nStates to ratify and implement all the relevant legal\ninstruments that together contribute to uprooting that\nmenace.\n\nWe should aim at concluding the draft comprehensive\nconvention against terrorism during this session of the\nGeneral Assembly.\nOn such important issues as peace and stability, it\nis often difficult to reach decisions and agree on\nresolutions here in the United Nations, let alone to\nensure that they are implemented. Full implementation\nof all relevant Security Council resolutions is\nimperative. It is therefore very encouraging to see that\nduring this session of the General Assembly, we have\nwitnessed that the emerging consensus on how to deal\nwith defiance of Security Council resolutions seems to\nbe having tangible results. Only yesterday, the Iraqi\nGovernment informed the United Nations that Iraq has\ndecided to cooperate fully with the Organization and to\ngive weapons inspectors unconditional access to the\ncountry. This is certainly a positive sign, but deeds will\nhave to follow.\nIn a recent visit to the Middle East, my belief was\nconfirmed that there must be a much stronger\ninvolvement of the international community in the\nMiddle East and involvement of third parties in the\nefforts to resolve the dispute there. In this regard,\nIceland fully supports the efforts of the Quartet, as well\nas the Saudi proposals. Negotiations on a political\nsettlement must resume; they must not be held hostage\nto the situation on the ground. Only a comprehensive\npeace agreement dealing with all aspects of the dispute\nwill guarantee security and prosperity for both Israelis\nand Palestinians.\nThe occupation of the Palestinian territories must\nend, in line with Security Council resolutions 242\n(1967) and 338 (1973). Iceland strongly supports the\ntwo-States solution. Israel and Palestine must live side\nby side in peace within secure and recognised borders.\nUntil a peace agreement has been reached, both\nparties have to play by certain rules. The sanctity of the\nlives of innocent civilians has to be respected under all\ncircumstances. This means that the Palestinian\nAuthority must reform itself to deal effectively with\nterror and pave the way for the establishment of a\ndemocratic and accountable Palestinian State. Israel\nalso has to respect international humanitarian law in\nthe occupied Palestinian territories, including East\nJerusalem. The circumstances on the ground have to\nchange for the better. Otherwise, there is a real danger\nthat the worsening of the economic situation in the\noccupied Palestinian territories could lead to a\nhumanitarian disaster.\nIceland strongly welcomes the entry into force of\nthe Rome Statute establishing the International\nCriminal Court (ICC). We urge all States that have not\nalready done so to ratify or accede to the Statute with\nthe aim of achieving universality in the fight against\nimpunity for the most serious international crimes.\nThe ICC certainly is one of the major\naccomplishments of the international community in\nstrengthening the international legal system. Some\n10\n\nconcerns have been voiced with regard to the possible\nabuse of the Rome Statute. These concerns should be\ncarefully studied with an open mind and without\nprejudice to the effective functioning of the ICC.\nConstant vigilance is needed to ensure respect for\nhuman rights and humanitarian law. Our continuous\nefforts to combat terrorism must not result in any form\nof human rights violations. All measures taken must be\nin accordance with international law.\nAllow me to dwell on human rights issues\naffecting women and children. Unfortunately, women's\nrights are sometimes viewed as a purely social issue\nrather than a human rights issue. More often than not,\nwomen are the prime victims of conflicts. Yet their\nright to participate on an equal footing in peace\nnegotiations and decision-making processes is still not\nrecognized. Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) is\nmeant to change this, and its provisions must be\nimplemented and respected.\nWhile progress has been made towards greater\ngender equality, the situation in many countries is still\ndire. Trafficking in women has increased, not least in\nEurope. The resumption of ancient methods of\npunishment of women in some parts of the world is\nappalling. Lack of education, information and health\ncare, as well as sexual exploitation, makes women\nparticularly vulnerable to the growing malice of\nHIV/AIDS.\nThe well-being of children is our responsibility.\nAll over the world, millions of children suffer because\nof poverty. They are cruelly exploited as child soldiers\nor labourers. They do not enjoy their right to education\nand are deprived of the decent life they are entitled to.\nIceland therefore welcomed the special session on\nchildren held last spring. The participation of children\nthemselves was especially successful. We need to listen\nto our children and make every effort to implement the\ndeclaration and plan of action of the special session, as\nwell as the international Convention on the Rights of\nthe Child.\nSustainable development has become an integral\npart of policies and strategies of local and national\ngovernments, international organizations, businesses\nand non-governmental organizations worldwide.\nDespite impressive progress made in many fields\nduring the past decade, especially with regard to the\nenvironment, millions of people still live in poverty\nand see little hope of escaping it. It is essential that\npoorer countries be allowed to enjoy the benefits of\ntheir comparative advantages and to put their human\nresources to work. Trade liberalization and free\ncommerce would be a major contribution to promoting\nequitable and sustainable growth for the benefit of\npoorer countries.\nAt the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment in Johannesburg, world leaders\nsucceeded in generating commitments for action. This\nis a major accomplishment. It is now up to each and\nevery one of us to see to it that these commitments are\nimplemented.\n\nAt the Summit, Iceland declared its willingness to\nincrease its bilateral development assistance by\nproviding training in the sustainable management of\nliving marine resources and the use of renewable\nenergy resources. A huge step forward in the\ndevelopment and utilization of renewable, clean energy\nresources is necessary in order to fulfil the\ncommitments laid down in the Kyoto Protocol.\nSustainable management and utilization of all living\nmarine resources is essential for food security and\nhunger alleviation.\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the\nSea is without doubt one of the greatest achievements\nof this Organization. For a country like Iceland, which\nis overwhelmingly dependent on the sustainable\nutilization of living marine resources, the Convention\nis of paramount importance. In our view, it is highly\nappropriate that the General Assembly will devote two\ndays during its fifty-seventh session for\ncommemorating the twentieth anniversary of the\nopening for signature of the Convention on the Law of\nthe Sea.\nThe Convention on the Law of the Sea has gained\nuniversal participation, and all the three institutions\nestablished by it are functioning in an effective manner.\nWe welcome the entry into force last December of the\nrelated Agreement on the Conservation and\nManagement of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly\nMigratory Fish Stocks. It is imperative that both the\nConvention and the Agreement be ratified by those\nStates that have not done so, that they be fully\nimplemented and that their integrity be preserved.\n\n\nIn the Millennium Declaration we resolved to\nstrengthen the United Nations system in order to make\nit more effective. In this context the revitalization of\nthe General Assembly is important. Reform measures\nsuch as the clustering of agenda items and, most\nrecently, the election in advance of the President and\nVice-Presidents of the General Assembly and the\nChairpersons of the Main Committees, are steps in the\nright direction. However, we must strive to deepen the\nreforms on the basis of the Millennium Declaration.\nIn many crisis situations in this past year, as so\noften before, the Security Council has proven effective\nand fulfilled a task satisfactorily. However, we must\nnot forget that the reform of the Security Council\nremains an issue that needs to be resolved. The\nCouncil's efficiency in coping with the serious issues\non its agenda must be further secured by making\nnecessary changes and adjustments with regard to its\ncomposition and working methods.\nIt is essential that the membership of the Council\nfairly reflect the whole membership of the United\nNations. It is also important to further enhance the\ntransparency in the decision-making process. In order\nto move the reform work forward, all Member States\nmust show flexibility and willingness to compromise.\nWe continue to face serious threats to\ninternational peace and stability. The best way to\npreserve the peace and work for prosperity and\ndemocracy in the world is to be steadfast in working in\nfull compliance with the Charter of the United Nations\nand the resolutions of its organs. No nation shall be\nallowed to destroy this common endeavour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I want\nto assure him that he can safely count on the full\nsupport of my delegation in discharging his important\nresponsibilities.\nI would also like to welcome in our midst the\nlatest new State Member of the United Nations,\nSwitzerland.\nIt was only four days ago, when so many of us\nhere paid tribute at Ground Zero to the memories of the\nthousands of victims who lost their lives last year in\nthe brutal 11 September terrorist attacks. The\nremembrance there was heartbreaking, but at the same\ntime it was a day of resolve as well. There is no doubt\nin my mind: this was a time that again brought into\nfocus our deep commitment to freedom and democracy.\nIn that regard, I would like to reiterate that the people\nand the Government of Hungary continue to maintain\nrelentlessly their strong solidarity with the United\nStates.\nOur contemporary world has been decisively\ntransformed since 11 September 2001. The fight\nagainst international terrorism is high on our agenda.\nHungary is strongly committed to the effective efforts\nof the community of nations to counter this threat.\nTowards that goal, we have consistently acted in\ncooperation with our allies and the rest of the\ninternational community.\nIn that respect, Hungary supports the ongoing\nglobal endeavours of the United Nations aimed against\nterrorism. We find it crucial that Member States make\nevery necessary and possible move to prevent further\nterrorist acts and implement national measures under\nrelevant Security Council resolutions to combat that\nphenomenon. Effective cooperation among States is\nalso indispensable to act resolutely against the menace\nof terrorism.\nBesides being a reliable partner in the global\ncoalition, Hungary has taken the necessary domestic\nlegislative and executive measures to implement the\ndecisions of the international community. The\nParliament of Hungary this week took the decision to\nratify the International Convention for the Suppression\nof the Financing of Terrorism. By this legislative act,\nHungary has become a party to all of the international\ninstruments adopted by the United Nations against\nterrorism. We continue to attach particular importance\nto the unimpeded work of the Counter-Terrorism\nCommittee of the Security Council, with which we\nmaintain a particularly close relationship.\nIn the context of the global coalition against\nterrorism, Hungary is following developments in\nAfghanistan with keen interest. We welcome the\nconsolidation achieved so far by the Government of\nAfghanistan with the assistance of the international\ncommunity. We wish to place on record our deep\n15\n\nappreciation for the excellent work done by the\ninternational forces. in that country. Further efforts to\ncontain and eliminate terrorist groups in Afghanistan\nwill remain a top priority. Hungary is committed to\nmaintaining its support to the Government of\nAfghanistan as well as to its people.\nIraqi non-compliance with Security Council\nresolutions is a serious concern for all of us. Hungary\nregrets that the Iraqi regime refuses to cooperate with\nthe United Nations and continues to pose a threat to\npeace and security in the region and the world at large.\nThe international community cannot disregard this fact\nand has to respond to it in a resolute manner. We will\nwork closely with our allies and partners to pursue the\nfull implementation of the relevant Security Council\nresolutions, and we will do our share in the efforts to\nbuild a broad coalition of nations in order to prevent\nthe Iraqi regime from producing and using weapons of\nmass destruction.\nHaving entered the twenty-first century, mankind\ncontinues to face further major global challenges, such\nas illicit drug trafficking, money-laundering, corruption\nand transnational organized crime. The role of the\nUnited Nations in facing and tackling these phenomena\nis of paramount importance. By the same token, global\nrisks are widened by new types of security threats. In\nour view, serious problems of regional stability, of low-\nintensity armed conflicts and threats of natural and\nman-made catastrophes are increasingly on the rise.\nIllegal transfers of nuclear, biological and chemical\nmaterials pose grave threats. Illegal migration and\nillicit trafficking in human beings are also rightly\nviewed as new forms of security risks. Hungary is more\nthan prepared to play its role, with all the means at our\ndisposal, to meet these new challenges through\nconcerted international efforts, including regional\narrangements.\nThe year 2002 marked the beginning of a new\nreview cycle of the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of\nNuclear Weapons. We expect the annual sessions of the\nPreparatory Committee leading up to the 2005 Review\nConference to make a significant contribution to the\nfurther strengthening of all aspects of this legal\ninstrument by ensuring its full implementation and\npromoting its universality.\nThe early start of negotiations on a fissile\nmaterial cut-off treaty stands out as the next logical\nstep aimed at curbing the proliferation of nuclear\nweapons. We cannot but regret that disagreements over\nthe comprehensive programme of work are preventing\nthe Conference on Disarmament from starting\nsubstantive work on this issue.\nOne of the most important new threats to\ninternational peace and stability in the changed security\nenvironment at the beginning of the twenty-first\ncentury is caused by the proliferation of ballistic\nmissiles capable of delivering weapons of mass\ndestruction. Hungary is ready to join international\nefforts to counter this danger, including new political\nand diplomatic initiatives. The system of multilateral\nlegal norms relating to non-proliferation, disarmament\nand arms control fails to include regulations on\nresponsible international behaviour concerning ballistic\nmissiles. Out of the several propositions emerged\nrecently, Hungary lends its utmost support to the\nnegotiations on an international code of conduct\nagainst the proliferation of ballistic missiles. We\nappreciate the vigorous efforts of the States members\nof the European Union to move this process forward\nand hope for its successful completion in the near\nfuture.\nDevelopments over the past 12 months have\nraised more critically than ever the question of how to\naddress in an efficient way the challenges posed by the\ndeliberate spread of disease, such as the anthrax\nincidents. The reinforcement of national public health\nand civilian defence capabilities is crucial, even though\nthere are only a few countries that, acting alone, can\nput meaningful assets in place. International\ncooperation in this respect must not be a distant\nopportunity; it is in the interest of each and every\ncountry, and of all nations as a whole.\nComplementary preventive efforts would be\nneeded as well to at least diminish the likelihood of\nsuch an occurrence. Among such preventive efforts, the\nbenchmarking of arms control compliance will\neventually have to find its legitimate place. That is why\nwe deem important the successful conclusion of the\nFifth Review Conference of States Parties to the\nBiological Weapons Convention, to be resumed in\nNovember this year under Hungarian chairmanship.\nHungary remains strongly committed to the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and its\nverification regime. In this regard, we concur with the\nview that nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation\nwill also be essential to combat international terrorism.\n16\n\nHungary has, from the very beginning, given its\nstrong support to the establishment of the International\nCriminal Court (ICC). The ICC has become the first\nmajor multilateral legal institution of the twenty-first\ncentury. We were proud to become a State party to the\nStatute of the ICC and to be among those whose\nratification helped bring about the entry into force of\nthe Statute this year. We firmly concur with the view\nthat international law will be strengthened through this\nnew legal institution.\nAs a sign of our deep commitment to the Rome\nStatute, my Government has decided to nominate a\ncandidate to the panel of judges of the ICC. I am\nconfident that the election of a Hungarian judge would\ncontribute to the genuine realization of the objectives\nset out in the Rome Statute.\nHuman rights are universal values. States\nMembers of the United Nations are expected to observe\nthe norms and standards of human rights and\nfundamental freedoms, including minority rights,\nadopted by the United Nations. By the same token, it\nwill remain the moral and political responsibility of\nStates to call upon others to act in accordance with\ntheir voluntarily undertaken obligations. Hungary will\nnot hesitate to raise its voice when human rights are\nviolated in any part of the world. International\nprotection of minority rights remains a major\npreoccupation for us. We continue to pursue our efforts\naimed at a functioning universal legal system for the\nprotection of minorities.\nGlobalization and interdependence are two major\nphenomena shaping the contemporary world, including\nthe political landscape of the United Nations.\nBy taking advantage of the opportunities\nstemming from these phenomena, all of us could seek a\nmuch better life for the inhabitants of our globe. The\nUnited Nations has the necessary instruments at hand.\nA better and more responsible use of these instruments\ncan contribute to the implementation of the Millennium\nDeclaration Development Goals, aimed at creating a\nmore prosperous and sustainable world for generations\nto come.\nIf we have the necessary political will and\ndetermination, we can have a United Nations that\nworks relentlessly to improve the lives of all. That is,\nin the final analysis, what the United Nations was\nfounded for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI should like first of\nall to congratulate Mr. Jan Kavan on his assumption of\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its fifty-\nseventh session, and to express gratitude to Mr. Han\nSeung-soo for his efforts as President during the fifty-\nsixth session.\nI also have pleasure in congratulating Switzerland\non becoming a Member State.\nThe United Nations, which is called upon to play\na leading role in ensuring international peace and\nsecurity, is currently undertaking a serious examination\nof its ability to unify the efforts of Member States and\nto organize efficient international cooperation in\nconfronting threats and risks that have a global\ndimension.\nThe tragic events that occurred in New York one\nyear ago made all of us look at the world in a new way\nand recognize the global interdependence of the\nchallenges of the new era. We must recognize that the\nworld itself has enabled the monster of terrorism to\ndevelop by ignoring problems, turning a blind eye to\nviolations of the norms of international law, tolerating\naggression and failing to respond to threats caused by\nthe illegal actions of some States, by separatism and by\nthe proliferation of weapons. It is necessary for us to\nlearn lessons from the mistakes made and to launch a\nbroad offensive against terrorism on the basis of\ncommon approaches.\nRespect for a universal approach that does not\npermit inconsistency, selectiveness or double standards\nis an indispensable condition for global solidarity in\nconfronting terrorism. The legal basis of such an\napproach must be set out in a comprehensive\nconvention to combat terrorism. No political, social,\nideological, religious or other reason can justify any of\nthe acts, methods or practices of terrorism. Effectively\ncounteracting terrorism and achieving its total\neradication demand the use of the broadest, most\ncomplex approach, taking into consideration the\nvarious aspects of the problem and its root causes.\nIt is obvious that terrorist groups recruit new\nmembers and flourish most easily in an environment\ncharacterized by economic and social degradation,\narmed conflict, poverty, illiteracy and self-isolation.\nThe necessary resources should be mobilized to open\nup new programmes of assistance to the developing\nand less developed countries, and to expand existing\nprogrammes. The implementation of United Nations\n26\n\ndecisions on assistance for the sustainable development\nand relaunching of economic growth in those countries\nplays a major role. We need to take special note of the\nneed to render urgent international assistance to\nAfghanistan.\nAnother important aspect in the eradication of\nterrorism is the avoidance of inter-civilizational\ntensions and the creation of a spirit of mutual respect\namong religions and cultures. We support the trend\ntowards continuing and deepening the dialogue among\ncivilizations, and we stress its multifaceted nature. We\nbelieve that the implementation of programmes in the\nfields of education, information and cultural dialogue\namong civilizations will facilitate the creation of\nrelations of mutual understanding and trust, which are\nso greatly needed in order to resolve the common\nproblems faced by both the West and the East.\nIn this context, I would like to stress in particular\nthe importance of the international conference initiated\nby Azerbaijan on \u201cThe Role of Religion and Belief in a\nDemocratic Society: Searching for Ways to Combat\nTerrorism and Extremism\u201d, to be held in cooperation\nwith the Organization for Security and Cooperation in\nEurope (OSCE) on 10 and 11 October 2002 in Baku.\nIn the combat against international terrorism,\npriority should be given to addressing militant\nnationalism and aggressive separatism. Very often\nterrorist groups of separatists and nationalists of\nvarious kinds maintain close ties among each other and\nare directly sponsored by States. The fight against\nterrorism represents an extremely complex problem in\nthe so-called uncontrolled territories that have emerged\nas a result of armed separatism and foreign aggression.\nFor 10 years now such an uncontrolled zone has\nexisted in that part of the territory of Azerbaijan\noccupied by Armenia. Elevating the ideology of\naggressive nationalism, terrorism and territorial claims\nto neighbours to the rank of State policy, the Republic\nof Armenia, through direct interference in the internal\naffairs of Azerbaijan, formed an armed separatist\nterrorist group within the Nagorno-Karabakh region of\nthe Republic of Azerbaijan. This was followed by\nopen, armed aggression by Armenia against\nAzerbaijan.\nArmenia, which perpetrated ethnic cleansing\nagainst the Azerbaijani people in their own territory in\n1987 and 1988, in 1992 and 1993 occupied the entire\nNagorno-Karabakh region, expelling 60,000 native\nAzerbaijani people. It has also occupied the territories\nof another seven regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan,\nthus bringing the total number of Azerbaijani refugees\nto 1 million. Armenia now intends to consolidate the\nresults of its aggression and ethnic cleansing and to\ntear away the Nagorno-Karabakh region from\nAzerbaijan.\nArmenia has tried to camouflage its annexationist\npolicy by appealing to the principle of the right of\npeoples to self-determination. However, according to\ninternational law, this principle can be realized only in\na peaceful way and in accordance with the principle of\nterritorial integrity. The right to self-determination\ndoes not imply the unilateral right of secession and\nshould not lead to the disintegration of a sovereign and\nindependent State.\nFurthermore, the Armenians residing in the\nNagorno-Karabakh region of the Republic of\nAzerbaijan can in no way be regarded as independent\nsubjects with the right to self-determination.\nThe assertion of the Armenian side that the\nNagorno-Karabakh region has never belonged to\nAzerbaijan is equally groundless, as is its reference to\ninternational law. Aside from the fact that appealing to\nhistory in the context of the settlement of inter-State\nconflicts is wrong, extremely dangerous and calls into\nquestion the universality of the norms of the\ninternational law, it must be noted that these statements\nby Armenia are refuted by numerous historical official\ndocuments.\nArmenia, which often refers to the League of\nNations to justify its territorial claims, must remember\nthat, in its official documents, the League of Nations\nexpressed doubt as to the existence of a stable\ngovernment capable of representing Armenia and, what\nis most important, certified Armenia's lack of clearly\ndefined borders.\nThe decisions of Armenia's Parliament on the\nreunification of the Nagorno-Karabakh region with\nArmenia and on the non-recognition of any\ninternational document which mentions this region as\nan integral part of Azerbaijan are illegal. Likewise, the\ndecisions taken by the illegal separatist regime in the\nNagorno-Karabakh region, the so-called referendums\nand elections it held in a situation of war and the\nforcible expulsion of the entire Azerbaijani population\ncannot have any international legal validity.\n27\n\nFurthermore, Armenia itself has violated the right\nof the Azerbaijani people to self-determination. In\naccordance with the universally recognized\ninternational legal doctrine uti possidetis juris, former\nUnion republics are recognized as new independent\nStates within borders previously existing within the\nfederations. These were the exact borders within which\nthe United Nations recognized Azerbaijan in March\n1992, when it accepted our country as a fully fledged\nMember of this universal Organization.\nIn 1993 the Security Council adopted resolutions\n822 (1993), 853 (1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993) on\nthe Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. These resolutions\nwere adopted following each new stage of Armenian\naggression against Azerbaijan. The Council\nunambiguously supported the sovereignty and\nterritorial integrity of the Republic of Azerbaijan,\nconfirmed its recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh as an\nintegral part of the Republic of Azerbaijan, and\nresolutely demanded the immediate, full and\nunconditional withdrawal of the Armenian forces from\nthe occupied territories of Azerbaijan and the creation\nof conditions for the return of refugees and displaced\npersons. However, these demands by the Security\nCouncil have so far not been implemented.\nThose resolutions also contained a request to the\nSecretary-General, the OSCE Chairman-in-Office and\nthe Chairman of the Minsk Group, to submit, in\nimplementing the mandate for the settlement of\nArmenian-Azerbaijani conflict, reports on the situation\nin the region to the Security Council. The last decision\nstressed the request to provide information on the\nprocess of the implementation of all four resolutions.\nRegrettably, this request still remains on paper only.\nSuch a state of affairs cannot be beneficial for us; it\nleads to the \u201cdischarging\u201d of the settlement process\nand, eventually, to a freezing of the situation at a\ndangerous point of fait accompli of the occupation. The\nnon-implementation of Security Council resolutions\nundermines its authority as well as people's belief in\njustice and in the possibility of a peaceful political\nsettlement.\nAs is well known, in the annual resolution of the\nGeneral Assembly on cooperation with the OSCE, the\nUnited Nations expresses its support for the efforts of\nthe regional organization and its Minsk Group, which\nmediates the settlement of the conflict in and around\nthe Nagorno-Karabakh region of the Republic of\nAzerbaijan.\nHow can we evaluate these decade-long efforts,\nwhich have been under way since the establishment of\nthe Minsk Group at the Conference on Security and\nCooperation (CSCE) Ministerial Council held in\nHelsinki in March 1992? While at the early stages of\nthe mediation the Minsk Group was putting forward\nproposals on the elimination of the consequences of the\nconflict, its present activities can be characterized as\nfollowing a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d policy against the\nbackground of the negotiations, until the victimized\nparty accepts the conditions of the aggressor.\nSuch a position on the part of the mediators can\nbe regarded only as passive support for Armenia's fait-\naccompli policy, which is unacceptable to us.\nAzerbaijan, which remains committed to a\npeaceful settlement of the conflict and to interaction\nwith the OSCE and its Minsk Group, sees an urgent\nneed for a new and resolute intervention by the\nSecurity Council, which so far has not used its\npotential effectively to contribute to the settlement of\nthe Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.\nThe current situation is explosive. Yes, the\nceasefire has been observed for eight years and\nmediation activity is being maintained, but a real\npeaceful settlement of the conflict has not occurred.\nAzerbaijan will never agree to the legalization of\nterritorial seizures. Azerbaijan will never accept the\nloss of a single inch of its territory and preserves its\nright to undertake all the necessary measures stipulated\nby the United Nations Charter to protect its sovereignty\nand territorial integrity.\nWe call upon the Security Council to review the\nexisting situation, to make Armenia immediately\nwithdraw its armed forces from the occupied territories\nof Azerbaijan and to engage in negotiations on defining\nthe status of the Nagorno-Karabakh region within\nAzerbaijan on the basis of the norms and principles of\ninternational law. We call upon the Republic of\nArmenia to heed the voice of reason and abandon its\npernicious policy of territorial claims against\nAzerbaijan. The continuation of the occupation of\nAzerbaijani lands and confrontation with Azerbaijan\nwill yield the Armenian people nothing but misfortune\nand suffering.\nThe conflict not only substantially undermines\nsecurity in the South Caucasus region, but also\nconstitutes a major obstacle to establishing bilateral\nand regional cooperation. This cooperation would have\n28\n\nprovided benefits to all States in the region and played\na crucial role in strengthening their positions and\nprestige in the international arena.\nMaking use of its natural resources and\nfavourable geographic location, Azerbaijan contributes\nimmensely to the development of the South Caucasus\nregion and in fact plays the role of engine in its\nintegration into the world system. According to data\nreleased last year by the Statistical Office of the\nEuropean Communities, 52 per cent of the gross\nproduct of the countries of the South Caucasus was\nproduced in Azerbaijan. A significant event, reaching\nfar beyond the South Caucasus borders, will take place\nin three days: the ground-breaking ceremony of the\nBaku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, the construction of\nwhich will give rise to a vast investment flow into the\neconomies of the countries.\nArmenia, by its actions against Azerbaijan, has\nisolated itself from participation in this kind of\neconomic project. Yes, at every level Armenia declares\nits willingness to cooperate with Azerbaijan, but in\nArmenia's understanding, Azerbaijan must turn a blind\neye to the occupation of its territories and establish\neconomic relations with Armenia. I think members will\nagree that hardly anyone could accept such a\nsuggestion, which in fact would represent appeasement\nof the aggressor.\nSeeking ways out of the present situation and to\nunblock the process of conflict resolution, Azerbaijan,\ndemonstrating a constructive approach, has proposed to\nArmenia that it withdraw its occupation forces from the\nfour occupied districts and that it subsequently restore\nthe main-line railway interlinking Azerbaijan, Armenia\nand other countries of the region. Conceived as a\ngesture of goodwill, this unique package of measures\nfor the partial elimination of the consequences of the\nconflict and for the revitalization of cooperation would\nsignificantly improve the negotiating environment and\npublic opinion in both countries. This proposal of\nAzerbaijan, promising benefits for both parties to the\nconflict and other countries of the region, enjoyed the\nwidest support of the OSCE and its Minsk Group, the\nEuropean Union and the Council of Europe. However,\nwhen it came to taking practical measures, Armenia,\ndiligently demonstrating its commitment to peace and\ncooperation, rejected this step towards confidence.\nThe situation of \u201cno peace, no war\u201d in the\nArmenian-Azerbaijani conflict is a time bomb and a\ncause of despair for the people, first and foremost\nrefugees and internally displaced persons, who have\nbeen violently deprived of their homes, left to bear the\nmost heavy burden of the consequences of the\naggression and are now losing patience and hope for\nthe restoration of their legal rights. As a result of\nArmenia's aggressive actions, Azerbaijan currently\ngives shelter to more than 1 million refugees and\ninternally displaced persons. In years past, great work\nhas been carried out to solve the refugees' problems,\nwith the assistance of international humanitarian\norganizations, the Office of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) above all.\nAt present, we feel that the urgent necessities for\ntargeted assistance are to provide medical institutions\nwith the necessary medical preparations and\nequipment, to implement agricultural programmes, to\ncreate jobs and to develop small-scale\nentrepreneurship. We call upon UNHCR, other\ninternational institutions and donor States to respond to\nour problems and to mobilize resources for facilitating\ntheir solution on the required scale.\nLet me briefly touch upon the issue of United\nNations reform aimed at increasing the effectiveness\nand practical results of the Organization's activities.\nWe have to determine a number of possible reforms,\namong which the expansion of the Security Council\ndeserves particular mention. I would like to express the\nhope that the broadest possible consensus on every\naspect of this issue will be reached. Greater balance\nwithin the Council could have been provided with the\ninclusion in its composition of influential developing\ncountries along with the developed ones. An increase\nin representation within one of the United Nations\nleading bodies \u2014 within rational limits \u2014 would have\nreflected the realities of the time and the consideration\nof broader interests in the solution of crucial issues\nrelated to the maintenance of international peace and\nsecurity. With regard to the reform, we would wish\nmore democracy, action and compatibility with the\nchallenges of change.\nI would like to believe that the reforms will\nenable the United Nations to confirm its role as a\nuniversal Organization capable of maintaining\ninternational peace and security, preventing and\nresolving regional conflicts, and confronting global\nthreats and risks under the new conditions of\nglobalization.\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe challenges we\nface at the beginning of the twenty-first century are\nimmense. We are facing terrible poverty; crises and\nwars; millions of refugees; the hideous face of\nterrorism; trafficking in human beings, arms and drugs;\nand regions decimated by disease as we continue to\ndestroy the earth's ecological balance.\nThere are no simple answers to these problems.\nBut there is a place where we all can meet to find\nsolutions: the United Nations. The world needs a strong\nUnited Nations.\nI have just quoted my Swiss colleague, first of all\nto celebrate his country's and East Timor's entry into\nthe United Nations, and secondly because I fully agree\nwith his statement.\nIn the words of Kofi Annan:\n\u201cThe more a country makes use of\nmultilateral institutions \u2014 thereby respecting\nshared values, and accepting the obligations and\nrestraints inherent in those values \u2014 the more\nothers will trust and respect it, and the stronger\nits chance to exercise true leadership\u201d. (See\nA/57/PV.2)\nI know the personal commitment of my dear\nfriend Jan Kavan, the President, to this principle. Our\ntwo countries have worked closely in a common effort\nto promote peace, the rule of law and shared values in\nSouth-eastern Europe.\nToday we can be proud that we also contributed\nin changing this region. It is no longer \u201cCNN-able\u201d, as\nour colleague from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr.\nLagumdjia, said yesterday.\nYet this has not been an easy process.\nTake my country, Greece. In the previous century,\nwe went through two world wars, two Balkan wars and\na major war with Turkey, which resulted in millions of\nrefugees and in painful population exchanges. We\nsuffered under civil war, famine and dictatorship. We\nwitnessed the forced division of Cyprus through\nmilitary invasion and occupation by Turkey, and the\nrecent wars in the disintegrating former Yugoslavia in\nour backyard. Not far from us, conflict continues. We\nstand ready to support all efforts to ensure that Israel\n17\n\nmay be secure and that the Palestinians may have a\nState they can call their own.\nIt is no wonder that today we cherish the peace\nwe have achieved. It is no wonder that we cherish the\nfact that Greece today has its most stable democracy in\nmodern history, that we are among the more prosperous\ncountries in the world, and that we will soon be hosting\none of the most demanding events humankind has\ncreated, the Olympics. This to us is a responsibility.\nWe have learned our lessons. We are where we\nare today only because of our people's steadfast\ncommitment to work for the shared values of\ndemocracy, peace, justice, and human rights.\nIt is no wonder that Greece has become a\nchampion of the enlargement of the European Union,\nbecause the European Union is a community of values,\nand being a community of values is the biggest peace\nproject of our region. We have a responsibility to our\nneighbours, from Turkey to Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nto see them, sooner or later, part of this wider European\nfamily \u2014 creating a new vision where all can share the\nvalues of peace and democracy and be citizens of the\nEuropean Union.\nWe have learned that at the heart of these\nconflicts are human beings, as the Danish Prime\nMinister, Mr. Rasmussen, has said. We have learned\nthat democracy and human rights are fundamental to\nthe life and dignity of all human beings.\nWhenever our global principles are violated, it is\nusually in societies and places where extremism and\nlack of democracy exist. I believe that democracy will\nisolate the phenomena that we have seen in recent\nyears, such as that of 11 September.\nWe in Greece have also known terrorism. We\nhave suffered at the hands of a small terrorist\norganization called November 17. Since June, Greek\nsecurity forces have brought all the key members of\nNovember 17 to justice. This formidable achievement\nwas supported by assistance from allied intelligence\nagencies, to which we are indebted for their support.\nThis experience is just one more example of how close\ninternational cooperation can accomplish common\ngoals and protect our common values. It is also a\ntribute to our long-lasting democratic institutions.\nIn the European Union, we are building not only\na community of nations but a community of values.\nThe Greek presidency of the European Union, which\nbegins in January 2003, will promote the values of\ndemocracy and peace in every element of its agenda.\nWe want to focus our efforts on reinforcing the trans-\nAtlantic relationship. We believe that the United States\nand the European Union share the same democratic\nvalues. We must stand united in our efforts to promote\npeace within a multilateral framework.\nWe also will pay tribute to the cultural diversity\nthat is at the heart of the European project, with a focus\non reinvigorating democratic governance by renewing\nour efforts to build social inclusiveness and civil\nparticipation across borders, working with our new\nneighbours, from the Baltic region to the\nMediterranean, from the Atlantic to the Caucasus, a\nnew neighbourhood of peace, cooperation and\ndemocracy.\nIn this community of values, I should like to talk\nabout a case in point. A few years ago, the notion of\nrapprochement between Greece and Turkey was\nunthinkable. Now, with a common European vision,\nour Governments are creating a framework to solve\nexisting problems, and citizen's diplomacy is building\na bridge of peace between our nations. Athens and\nAnkara have concluded a number of agreements in\nareas ranging from energy to tourism, from education\nto landmines, designed to ease tension and strengthen\nour common interests. While fundamental differences\nremain on certain issues, in a short space of time, we\nhave come a long way \u2014 and we surely can go further.\nI welcome my discussion and meeting with the new\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. G\u00fcrel, and his\nwillingness to continue on this path of rapprochement\nand peace.\nYet our shared values are being sorely tested on\nthe issue of Cyprus. There is now a compelling\ndeadline for a resolution to the continuing division of\nthe island. Negotiations for the accession of the\nRepublic of Cyprus to the European Union will be\nfinalized in December. We hope that a free, united\nCyprus will join a free, united Europe. Unification will\nundoubtedly bring greater security and prosperity to\nboth the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities on\nthe island. But if a political settlement is not reached,\nthe internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus will\njoin alone. Let us therefore work to break down the\nwalls that keep future European Union citizens apart.\nWith the exception of Turkey, the whole world\nshares a vision for Cyprus as a federal State with a\n18\n\nsingle international personality and a single citizenship,\nno foreign troops on its soil, and equal rights and\nsecurity guarantees for both the Greek and Turkish\nCypriot communities. The vast majority of the Cypriot\npopulation agrees that the two communities can and\nshould live together, united by shared values, while\npreserving their individual cultural identities.\nWe must respect United Nations resolutions on\nCyprus. They must be honoured, as my Maltese\ncolleague just repeated.\nCyprus is also a critical factor for the stability\nand security of South-eastern Europe and the Middle\nEast. A solution to this problem, therefore, will widen\nthe area of stability and peace throughout the region.\nNot much farther away, the situation in Iraq is a\nchallenge for us all. It challenges our respect for\ninternational law and our respect for international\norganizations. Greece vows to act in the way it sees fit\nto safeguard these valued principles.\nIn dealing with Iraq, our actions must be guided\nby evidence of a threat to global security, and must be\nembedded in respect for the well-being of the Iraqi\npeople. We must exhaust all available diplomatic\nmeans to ensure that Iraq complies with existing\nUnited Nations resolutions, immediately accepts the\nunconditional return of United Nations weapons\ninspectors and destroys all weapons of mass\ndestruction. This will free the people of Iraq from the\neconomic sanctions, which are depriving them of their\nbasic needs.\nWe welcome the statement by President Bush. By\ntaking the issue of Iraq back to the Security Council, he\nhas both challenged the Council and empowered it to\nmove forward more effectively and more credibly.\nDemocracy is a value that should not be taken for\ngranted. It must be reinforced to meet new challenges\nin a globalizing world. In this spirit, Greece launched,\nin Johannesburg, the first-ever online global poll on\nsustainable development and the environment.\nElectronic democracy offers tremendous potential for\nbridging the digital divide that separates many peoples\nand individuals, for strengthening civil participation\nand for enhancing global democratic legitimacy and\ntransparency. We suggest that the United Nations\nestablish a new global forum \u2014 an electronic\nDemos \u2014 where citizens could articulate their views,\nmobilize around the issues that concern them and shape\npolitical decision-making, both nationally and\ninternationally.\nGreece will make good on its commitment to\nsustainable development by taking concrete actions and\nidentifying specific targets.\nThis year, many countries celebrated the\nestablishment of an institution that was founded on the\npremise that good global governance must be built on\nsound global principles. The International Criminal\nCourt represents a commitment by our community of\nnations that no crime against humanity will go\nunpunished. Creating a watertight system of global\njustice which requires all countries to uphold common\nrules, principles and rights will be an important step\ntowards building a real community of global values.\nFinally, I would like to say that those values lie at\nthe heart of the Olympic Truce, which was endorsed by\nthe Millennium Summit and the Millennium\nDeclaration. It is global peace initiative which was just\nrecently endorsed by the former President of South\nAfrica, Nelson Mandela. When he signed the Olympic\nTruce in June, President Mandela said:\n\u201cThe Olympic Games represent one of the\nmost evocative moments of celebration of our\nunity as human beings in pursuit of noble ideas.\nAmong those ideas is the quest for global peace.\u201d\nWe uphold the values of democracy, human\nrights, peace and sustainable development; they can\nenrich us all. They can inspire us and challenge us.\nThey are values that can inspire change in one person,\nin one community or in a large nation. They are values\nthat can change the life of not just one person, but the\nworld as a whole. These are the values upon which we\nmust build our future and the future of our children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We welcome the\nUnited Nations Security Council resolution 1373\n(2001), which stipulates the establishment of the\nCounter-Terrorism Committee to coordinate and\nincrease the efficiency of the international\ncommunity's efforts to fight this most dangerous threat\nof the twenty-first century.\nI would like to recall in this regard that\nUzbekistan strongly urged establishment of such a\ncommittee within the United Nations as early as 1999.\nUzbekistan is one of the few countries that are\nparties to all twelve conventions on combating\nterrorism. We sincerely hope that the appeal by\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan to the United Nations\nMember States to join and ratify these documents will\nbe followed and put into practice.\nUzbekistan supports the international counter-\nterrorism coalition as a matter of principle and stands\nready to make its contribution to enhance global and\nregional stability.\n17\n\nThe events of 11 September made the world face\nup to the situation in Afghanistan and, one can say,\nopened the eyes of the international community to the\nfact that terrorism has no borders and only through\njoint efforts we can defeat this perilous challenge to\nhumanity. In a strict and, I would say, categorical way\nthe events of 11 September reminded everybody that\ntwenty years of war turned Afghanistan into a breeding\nground and hotbed of international terrorism that\nthreatened not only neighbouring countries and nations,\nbut all of humanity.\nWe are gratified today by the positive\ndevelopments in that country; we welcome the\nconvening of the Loya Jirga, and the transitional\nGovernment led by President H\u00e2mid Karzai.\nAt the same time, despite the successful\ncompletion of the military phase of the counter-\nterrorist operation in Afghanistan, today there can be\nno room for complacency.\nFirst, huge amounts of weapons accumulated\nduring the long years of war in Afghanistan still remain\nin the possession of armed groups there. In this context\nthere can be no justification for the attempts of certain\nStates to supply ever more weapons to this long-\nsuffering land.\nTo ensure stability and prevent military\nconfrontation it is important to resolve the problems\nrelated to the reduction and collection of the huge\namounts of weapons accumulated in Afghanistan.\nClearing the Afghan territory of weapons arsenals\nbelonging to criminal groups will also reinforce the\nactivities of the United Nations and regional\ninstitutions to thwart the illicit arms trade.\nSecondly, the post-war dislocation, economic\ndisaster, as well as the lack of resources to rebuild\nAfghanistan, may become a catalyst for social unrest\nthat could be used by certain armed groups inside and\nbeyond Afghanistan to create a new round of military\nconfrontation.\nThirdly, there are still various groups in the\nterritory of Afghanistan, including remnants of the\nTaliban, that are capable of conducting subversive\nactions and guerrilla warfare. Confrontation continues\namong various warlord-leaders of different ethnic\ngroups.\nFourthly, the situation on drug trafficking remains\nalmost unchanged. Afghanistan is still the world's main\nsupplier of opium and heroin. According to many\ninternational experts, the removal of the Taliban regime\ndoes not yet mean the elimination of the criminal\nnarcotics business in Afghanistan. Today the whole\nworld is seriously concerned about this problem. There\nis an urgent need for adequate measures and assistance\non the part of the entire international community, as\nwell as the active support of the Afghan authorities to\ncombat narco-aggression.\nThe number of drug addicts in the world runs into\nthe hundreds of millions of people. Proliferation of\ndrug addiction undermines both the health of living\ngenerations and the gene pool of nations. This affects\npeople in both the developed and developing countries.\nThe Republic of Uzbekistan, making great efforts to\nfight drug production, abuse and trafficking, fully\nsupports the measures undertaken by the United\nNations and the international community to confront\nthese threats.\nI would like to underline that it is much easier\nand more effective to fight drug trafficking at the\nsource. Therefore, we have to block the huge flow of\nthe Afghan drugs right at the borders of the Central\nAsian States, rather than hunt for grammes and\nkilogrammes in Europe and other developed countries.\nIn this regard, it is advisable to shift from\nnumerous counter-narcotics programmes of small\nefficiency to the concrete solution of this acute\nproblem by allocating the United Nations-controlled\nresources and means to nip the narcotics trafficking at\nthe source.\nToday the attention of the entire international\ncommunity is riveted on the issue of Iraq. In this regard\nwe support the statement of United States President\nGeorge Bush delivered in the United Nations from this\nvery rostrum.\nThe measures towards resolution of the current\nsituation proposed by the President of the United States\ndeserve thorough consideration and may be taken as a\nbasis for the elaboration of the position to be taken by\nthe United Nations Security Council.\nUzbekistan attaches great significance to the\nstrengthening of the global process of non-proliferation\nof weapons of mass destruction. Our country has\nalready received credit for its activity in this field. The\nstrategy of Uzbekistan in ensuring security is based on\nthe country's participation in the United Nations-led\n18\n\nprocesses of disarmament and arms control and\nreduction.\nUzbekistan fully supports the principle of\nindivisibility of security and in this context, as an\ninitiator of the nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central\nAsia, acknowledges responsibility for strengthening the\nnuclear non-proliferation regime and takes active part\nin the elaboration process of international instruments\nin this field.\nUzbekistan proposes to sign the practically\nfinalized and agreed draft of the document on the\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia in\nKazakhstan in the city of Semipalatinsk, the former site\nfor hundreds of nuclear tests, in the presence of United\nNations Secretary-General Kofi Annan during his\nupcoming visit to the Central Asian region.\nThe Republic of Uzbekistan supports proposals\nmade by Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the United\nNations reforms. This is necessary for an appropriate\nadaptation of this Organisation to the dynamic changes\nin the international arena. Uzbekistan is one of those\nStates that considers the United Nations Security\nCouncil reforms to be part of the evolution of the entire\nUnited Nations system.\nThe current structure of the Security Council\nreflects the realities of a past era. The world has\nchanged since then. We believe that Japan and\nGermany have a legitimate right to permanent\nmembership in the Security Council. All necessary\ngrounds for this are present.\nIn conclusion, I would like to recall that it has\nbeen ten years since Uzbekistan became a United\nNations Member, and it is very gratifying to see the\nUnited Nations family expanding. We congratulate\nSwitzerland and the Democratic Republic of Timor-\nLeste on their decision to become fully-fledged parties\nto the multilateral cooperation and dialogue of the\nUnited Nations. It should mean that the idea of peace\nand noble principles of the global security system are\nthe order of the day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe\nheroic people of Venezuela and its revolutionary\nGovernment greet all peoples and all Governments of\nthe world represented in the General Assembly of the\nUnited Nations.\nI must begin by underlining the intense activity\nthat Venezuela has undertaken within the framework of\nthe agenda of the United Nations this year of 2002. For\nthat reason, we made the effort to come here to this\nmost timely session of the General Assembly.\nVenezuela began the year by assuming in January\nthe presidency of the Group of 77 and China. We\ncoordinated and managed that very important group of\ncountries of the world, primarily the countries of the\nthird world. First, we coordinated the preparations,\ndocuments, agreements and dialogues leading up to the\nMonterrey Summit, where we attended, speaking on\nbehalf of the countries of the South and especially on\nbehalf of the countries of the Group of 77 and China.\nVenezuela then continued that effort by coordinating\nour Group in preparation for the important\nJohannesburg Summit on Sustainable Development,\nheld a few days ago. The discussions at the\nJohannesburg Summit are still fresh in our minds.\nThis year, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\nalso held the presidency of the Group of 15, another\nimportant group of developing countries fighting for\ngreater scope in the political, economic and social\ndomains.\nFinally, Venezuela has had a very intense agenda\nat the United Nations during this year of 2002, and in\nthe remaining months we wish to finish the year with\nan even greater intensity, making proposals,\ncoordinating actions and seeking decisions to complete\nand contribute our modest effort in the search for the\nsolutions, goals and objectives set out in this Hall\nduring the historic Millennium Summit of 2000.\nThus we come once again to this Hall to ensure\nthat the world hears the voice of millions of men,\nwomen and children who fight daily for their life and\ndignity by striving towards justice in the homeland of\nSim\u00dbn Bolvar.\nTo begin, I would say that this session of the\nGeneral Assembly is meeting amidst the suffering and\n2\n\nmourning afflicting the people of the United States, the\npeople and city of New York and all peoples of the\nworld, on this first anniversary of the heinous acts of\n11 September. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,\nfrom the soul of its heroic people and from the heart of\nits revolutionary and democratic Government, prays to\nGod our Lord for the eternal peace of the victims of\nthose horrible events. It also reiterates its sentiments of\nsolidarity and condolences to their families. It affirms\nits condemnation of those who planned and carried out\nthose terrorist actions. We also offer our efforts in the\nfight against the scourge of terrorism in the world in its\nmost diverse facets and manifestations. However, at the\nsame time, Venezuela stresses the necessity of\nrecognizing the complexity of the alarming situation in\nthe world today. The direct condemnation of terrorism\nmust necessarily be accompanied  for ethical and\nmoral reasons  by an equally forceful condemnation\nof the causes and processes that have transformed the\nworld into an infinite sum of marginalized individuals\nand a reign of injustice, inequality and poverty. It is\nwritten in the Bible, which contains God's words, that\nthe only path to peace is justice.\nThe resolute repudiation of terrorism must also be\naccompanied by an unreserved political resolve on the\npart of the leaders of the world to acknowledge, for\nexample, that today's international economic system\nfuels a process in which the perverse doctrine of\nunbridled neoliberalism leads to greater poverty,\ninequality and despair among the poor peoples of our\nearth.\nFor example, 17 people die of hunger every\nminute in the world. If we were to fulfil all the\ncommitments undertaken to combat poverty, it would\ntake us 130 years to eradicate it from the planet,\naccording to figures cited in the most recent report of\nthe United Nations Development Programme.\nThe condemnation of terrorism must go hand in\nhand with a decision-making process that will make it\npossible to make greater headway in the war  the\nwar, I stress  against poverty. For that reason,\nVenezuela has consistently advocated  first at\nMonterrey and then, more recently, at Johannesburg \nthat an international humanitarian fund should be\ncreated whose resources might come, for example,\nfrom a percentage of global military expenditure. It\ncould be funded by a percentage of the immense\nresources, those billions and billions of dollars, that\nwe, the developing countries, the poor countries,\nannually transfer to the developed world through the\nperverse mechanism of external debt  or eternal debt,\nI should say.\nI am sure that the countries of Africa and Asia\ncan tell the same story as we in Latin America do. In\nthe last 20 years of the twentieth century, Latin\nAmerica paid off more than twice the amount of its\nexternal debt. But now it turns out that we owe more\nthan when we began this whole perverse process.\nIt seems only fair to me that, given the situation\nthat faces the world and the bleak path that we are\nfollowing, this issue must be debated. Why not transfer\na portion of this eternal debt' to an international\nhumanitarian fund  a fund that could also be\nfinanced by monies confiscated from drug traffickers,\nwho do so much harm in the world, and from corrupt\nindividuals who have walked off with billions of\ndollars from poor countries.\nVenezuela has a list that it will provide to the\npolice forces of the world. It will assist them in getting\nback billions of dollars and in transferring them to an\ninternational fund. Such a fund could also be financed\nthrough a tax that could be levied, quite justly, on\nmajor speculative capital transactions. There could be\nother possible sources as well; of course, this would\nrequire a very high-level political decision at the global\nlevel.\nToday, faced with the world's tragedy, Venezuela\ninsists on this idea, and we ask the United Nations to\nengage in a debate on this issue. In Johannesburg, for\nexample, I recall that we began very interesting\ndiscussions in a number of round table meetings in\nwhich Venezuela participated. We discussed this topic,\nand I was very gratified to see a consensus emerge\namong the heads of State and Government present\nthere. I was very pleased with the support expressed for\nthat idea by the President of brotherly Brazil, Fernando\nHenrique Cardoso, who, during the Johannesburg\nround tables, commented on the need to create\ninstruments such as this, given that today's\ninternational financial agencies are not adequately\nequipped to combat poverty  a scourge that besets all\nof humankind.\nPresident Cardoso referred to the Marshall Plan,\nwhich was put into effect to assist Europe in the post-\nwar period. I think that today we would need hundreds\nof Marshall Plans around the world to save the\ncountries of the third word from hell and from death.\n3\n\nBut just as we condemn global terrorism and its\ncauses, I have come to the Assembly also on behalf of\nthe valiant people of the Bolivarian Republic to\ndenounce out loud other kinds of terrorism and other\nkinds of causes. In Venezuela, we have seen the\nbeginning of a process of planned, systematic\nterrorism, which erupted in violence and blood also on\nthe eleventh  11 April, not 11 September  this year,\nthat is, five months ago. On that day, a fascist putsch\noverthrew the legitimate Government that I am\nprivileged to head, and installed, for an extremely brief\nperiod, a dictatorship that filled with fear the streets,\ncities and villages of our beloved Venezuela.\nWhat were the causes of that bloody terrorist\ncoup d'\u00e9tat, which resulted in the loss of dozens of\nhuman lives and wounded hundreds of people, who are\nstill recovering from their very serious injuries? Quite\nsimply, what we had was a democratic Government \na legitimate Government elected by the people; a\nGovernment that has committed itself to revolutionary\ndemocracy and to political, economic and social\nchange; a Government that has very resolutely and very\nseriously undertaken to put into effect the principles of\nthe United Nations; a Government that has undertaken\nthe task of carrying out social actions that will\ntransform society in order to bring justice and equality\nto our people; a Government that has doubled the\nbudget for education in less than three years; a\nGovernment that has doubled the health-care budget; a\nGovernment that has reduced by 10 per cent infant\nmalnutrition; a Government that has increased by 10\nper cent its people's access to drinking water; a\nGovernment that has reduced infant mortality from 21\nper 1,000 to 17 per 1,000; a Government that has\nincreased by 30 per cent children and adolescents'\naccess to free and compulsory public education. This is\na Government that has had to deal with the wild\nneoliberal privatization of health and education, a\nGovernment that began by reducing poverty and\nmarginalization in a country that is full of wealth but\nhas been governed by senseless elitists who were\ncompletely insensitive to people's needs. A\nGovernment such as this was overthrown by a fascist\nalliance among privileged sectors, factions instigating a\ncoup d'\u00e9tat using media terror.\nThere is an issue in today's world that needs to be\ndiscussed in the world but few dare to do so; I would\nlike to be bold enough to discuss it. This issue is the\nuse of mass media in the world. Venezuela is a good\ncase to be studied. Mass media, exploiting the freedom\nof expression and the freedom of the press, supported\nthe putsch and manipulated society. The most appalling\nthing was that, when the people reacted against the\ndictatorship, the popular reaction was silenced and\nbroadcasting was stopped and nobody knew what was\nhappening in Venezuela. I think this is a special case of\nethics in media communications that deserves to be\nstudied.\nA little while ago, a great intellectual and Latin\nAmerican writer, the Uruguayan Eduardo Galeano,\nauthor of Open Veins of Latin America spoke of the\nquestion of mass media around the world and said this\ngreat truth: Never have so few deceived so many.' We\nneed to tackle this with courage as we face the\nbeginning of this century. The elitist perpetrators of the\nputsch used the mass media and think they can\ncontinue to use them. They used police terrorism and\nmilitary terrorism and achieved a very powerful\nalliance that was successful in overthrowing the\nGovernment and succeeded in taking me prisoner and\nkeeping me incommunicado for many hours on a\nCaribbean island. This fascist coup eliminated the\nCongress, overthrew all laws and all public branches of\nauthority and did away with the judicial branch. It\nseized mayors and members of Parliament elected by\nthe population. However, in spite of all of this, they\ncould not oppress us. Within a few hours, something\nhappened in Venezuela that has scarcely ever happened\nin any country or nation. People began to rush out into\nthe streets, without weapons, with only the weapons of\ntheir courage and their hearts and with the Bolivarian\nConstitution in their hands. Millions of men and\nwomen and young people went out into the streets,\nclamouring for respect for their dignity and  miracle\nof miracles  in less than forty-eight hours, the\nGovernment along with patriotic soldiers overthrew the\ndictatorship, restored the Constitution, rescued the\nPresident who had been abducted and restored\ndemocracy to Venezuela. This was a miracle. Only a\npeople that is united can achieve this. Only a people\nthat is conscious and active can sweep away such\nfascist and terrorist assaults. This was the first time\nthat this was ever seen in any nation for a very long\ntime.\nMine is a people that has regained its libertarian\nessence and its liberating essence. A people that, since\nthe time of Sim\u00dbn Bolvar hardly two hundred years\nago, has worked together with Colombia, Ecuador,\n4\n\nPeru, Bolivia, Panama to achieve the independence of\nhalf of the continent of the Americas. This is the\nVenezuelan people for whom I, once again, reaffirm\nmy undying love and devotion for their courage and\ndignity.\nAnd here, from this rostrum, on behalf of this\npeople, I offer my sincere and warm thanks for all the\ngestures of solidarity that we received from here, from\nthe United Nations, from the Organization of American\nStates, from Governments and above all, from many\ncountries of the Americas. Messages came also from\nAsia, Europe, Africa and Oceania, because this was a\nunique situation at the beginning of this century. This\nconstitution is a revolutionary peaceloving and\ndemocratic document. It was drafted by the people\nitself and is now being defended and promoted by the\npeople.\nIn conclusion, following these events we in\nVenezuela are aware, we know  I realize that many\npeople do not yet know  we have experienced\nterrorism first hand.\nA few days ago a video came out, more proof of\nwhat was being planned in Venezuela. In that video an\ninternational journalist made some revelations, stating\nthat he was called in the morning on the day of the\ncoup and that, long before the first person fell dead as a\nresult of shooting by a number of snipers  there were\nsome foreigners among them  the coup perpetrators\nwere already recording a message in which they said\nthat President Ch\u00b7vez had ordered people to be killed\nand that there had been six deaths. Well before the\nfiring and the massacre of defenceless people began,\nthey had already recorded this message.\nUltimately, fortunately, the military and civilian\nreaction was very rapid, because the terror that had\nbeen planned against the Venezuelan people on a\nmassive scale would have meant that terrorist practices\nwould be applied against anything that was popular or\ndemocratic in Venezuela. They expected to repeal the\nConstitution. But, of course, it was restored within\nforty-eight hours because of the peaceful democratic\nrevolution brought about by the people.\nWe are grateful for the international community's\nunequivocal condemnation of the coup d'\u00e9tat  the\nnightmare  that we experienced for some days in\nVenezuela. And we reaffirm that our Government, in\nwhich Venezuelans have placed their confidence in a\nnumber of successive democratic processes, will not\nengage in a witch hunt, or carrying out summary trials\nor executions. As the people say  there is a song they\nsing in the streets: He's back, he's back, he's back.'\nWith strict adherence to our humanitarian and\nBolivarian tradition and upholding our national\nConstitution, we came back with our Constitution in\nour hands on the popular tide that swept the legitimate\nGovernment back, along with the Constitution, and put\nan end to the terrorists, the coup d'\u00e9tat and its\nperpetrators. For the first time in Venezuela's history,\nvictory in a political conflict  and bear in mind that\nthis was the overthrow of a dictatorship  meant that\nthe Government that returned respected those who had\nbeen defeated.\nWe have now engaged in a major national\ndialogue, a national debate. In this we have also\nrequested the help of the United Nations through the\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and\nasked for support from representatives of the\nOrganization of American States. We have also\nrequested support from the Carter Center headed by\nformer President Jimmy Carter.\nWe are grateful for their support and we reaffirm\nthat Venezuela will continue to be guided by God and\nby the hand of its people, with the Bolivarian\nConstitution in its grasp. In doing so we will be joining\nthe world to contribute to seek out alternatives to the\neconomic models that have unleashed hunger and\nmisery upon the world. We will continue to make our\nmodest contribution, backed by the efforts of millions.\nWe will continue to make a supreme effort to change\nthe world and to make it viable so that, as soon as\npossible in the twenty-first century, justice will be\nachieved. For, as the word of God has asserted for\nthousands of years, justice is absolutely the only path\nto genuine peace.\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me first extend\nmy congratulations and a warm welcome to\nSwitzerland, a neighbouring country of Liechtenstein,\non its membership in the United Nations. Switzerland\nhas for centuries lived the ideals of the United Nations\nas a place where peoples of different ethnic\nbackgrounds, languages, cultures and religions have\npeacefully lived together and have founded a nation\nbased on democratic principles and the rule of law.\nNow its people have chosen to join the United Nations.\nWe look forward to Switzerland's contribution, its\nexpertise and experience in the challenging work of\nthis Organization. Together with the admission of East\nTimor a few days from now, this brings the United\nNations even closer to being what it was intended to\nbe, a truly universal family of nations.\nIn the past year, the United Nations has again\nconvened a number of meetings at the highest level, with\nthe best intentions and the most ambitious agendas. Those\nincluded the special session on children, the International\nConference on Financing for Development and the World\nSummit on Sustainable Development. All these meetings\nhave resulted in important outcomes, but they have\nsometimes fallen short of the expectations of those most\ndirectly affected. Bigger is not always better. We\nbelieve that the era of such world conferences and\nsummits has come to a close. We have established good\nstandards and must now focus on their implementation.\nThe Millennium Development Goals must be given\nprimary importance in this respect.\nA few years ago, we had hoped to be entering an\nera of the primacy of the rule of law. Small States in\nparticular rely on the rule of law, both at the national\nand at the international levels, where this Organization\nplays a particular role. Today, we are all challenged\nmore than ever to uphold the principle of the rule of\nlaw. The events of 11 September made us realize that\nno person and no place is immune to the threat of\ninternational terrorism. The international community,\nand especially this Organization, responded vigorously.\nFor weeks immediately after the attacks, countries\nwere determined to join forces to oppose and eliminate\nthe threat to all of us. Today provides a good\nopportunity not only to commemorate those who have\ndied at the hands of international terrorists, but also to\nreassess our common response and responsibility as the\ninternational community.\nIn looking back, we realize today that the sense of\nworking together we all felt was short-lived and that it\nhas not extended to all areas. After the terrorist attacks\nthere was recognition that international terrorism can\nonly be fought successfully if all States and nations\nwork together. This raised hopes for an era of genuine\nmultilateralism. However, those hopes vanished\nquickly and were replaced by the realization that\nunilateralism and confrontation were again dominant.\nOne example of such confrontation was the\ndebates on the International Criminal Court, which\nextended even to the Security Council. Holding these\ndebates implied, ironically, that the International\nCriminal Court jeopardized peacekeeping operations of\nthe United Nations. As a State party to the Rome\nStatute, we welcomed the entry into force of the Statute\non 1 July as a true landmark in the history of\ninternational justice. We remain fully committed to\npreserving the integrity of the Court's Statute. We\nfound it therefore disquieting that the Council dealt\nwith the International Criminal Court in a manner\nsuggesting that the Court posed a threat to international\npeace and security.\nThe Security Council, above all, is called upon to\nuphold the rule of law. The state of affairs worldwide\nmakes it abundantly clear that credible and effective\n28\n\naction by the Council is needed now more than ever.\nSecurity Council resolution 1373 (2001) illustrates how\ndetermined action by the Council can contribute to\nfighting real threats to international peace and security.\nMy Government has attached the highest priority to the\nwork of the Counter-Terrorism Committee established\npursuant to that resolution. We submitted on time two\ncomprehensive reports on our national implementation\nthereof. One year after the inception of the Committee's\nwork, we have to take stock of its achievements and of the\nchallenges ahead. There are obviously different stages of\nimplementation worldwide and diverging capacities of\nStates, especially in the area of combating the\nfinancing of terrorism.\nThus, it is imperative to introduce minimal\nstandards to which all States need to adhere. Such an\neffort to set and implement benchmarks will ensure the\npractical impact and continued political relevance of\nthe Counter-Terrorism Committee. We all must strive\nto bring our national enforcement and cooperation\nmechanisms to the highest achievable standards. This,\nhowever, must be accompanied by a set of minimum\nstandards which are observed and enforced globally. As\nstated on previous occasions, Liechtenstein stands\nready to make its contribution to developing such\nstandards and to contribute to compliance enhancement\nby offering our extensive practical expertise.\nInjustice must not be fought through injustice.\nThe fight against terrorism must therefore go hand in\nhand with basic standards of the rule of law.\nOverzealous action must not, as has occurred in some\ninstances, jeopardize the rights of the individual. Non-\nderogable human rights, as contained in the relevant\ninternational treaties, must be safeguarded under all\ncircumstances. States have an obligation to ensure that\npeople who are suspected of having committed acts of\nterrorism are treated in accordance with the relevant\nstandards. The United Nations, as the primary\ninternational law-making body, has a special\nresponsibility in this respect and has to live up to its\nobligation to be the guardian of the rule of law.\nWhen the United Nations is called upon to uphold\nthe rule of law, it must, of course, ensure first and\nforemost the legality of its own actions in all areas and,\nin particular, when it comes to armed action and\nintervention. The Charter of the United Nations\nprovides for the sanctioning of such action by the\nSecurity Council. The debates of the past few weeks\nhave made it clear that nothing can replace \u2014 as\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan put it so aptly \u2014 the\nunique international legitimacy provided through a\ndecision of the Council. Legality, and thus political\ncredibility, are ensured through seizing the Council. At\nthe same time, however, the full implementation of all\nsuch decisions must be ensured. This must therefore be\nthe way to go for the international community.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Today,\nfrom this rostrum, on behalf of the Union of the\n26\n\nComoros and the Comorian people, I wish to evoke the\nmemory of all those who in the United States and\nelsewhere have suffered injustice at the hands of those\nwho have acted outside faith or law. We condemn\nterrorism in all its forms.\nAllow me to congratulate President Kavan\nwarmly on behalf of the delegation of the Union of the\nComoros, which I have the honour to head. I also wish\nto convey the trust and confidence that we have in him\nto lead the work of this session, based on his\nexperience, personal qualities and diplomatic expertise.\nPermit me also to convey to His Excellency Mr. Han\nSeung-soo our great pleasure and admiration by\nrecognizing the outstanding work he did as President of\nthe previous session. I wish to convey a strong tribute\nto His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, our Secretary-\nGeneral, for his constant devotion in the service of our\nOrganization.\nThe Union of the Comoros heartily welcomes\nSwitzerland and Timor-Leste as new Members of our\nOrganization. The United Nations is an organization\nwhose duty it is to assure humankind the conditions of\nliving in peace, dignity and prosperity. This is an\nenormous and large-scale task that surely poses certain\ndaunting difficulties that we will need to overcome.\nThis must be so, because in no way must we or should\nwe shrink away from obstacles and challenges. This\ninstitution must be the true guarantor of the hopes of\npresent and future generations.\nThis requires a true awareness of its universality,\nwhich calls for reforming its main organs. These\norgans must be in a position to reflect and adapt to the\nreality of the present world.\nFurthermore, and in a different context, this new\npolitical framework must go hand in hand with\ndevelopment, a development that takes into account the\ninequalities, but also the specificities of each place.\nThere are many evils gnawing at our planet, but they\naffect us in different degrees. The advances of the\ntechnological world of the North contrast with the\nfierce struggle of the South, even now in the twenty-\nfirst century, to achieve the most basic living\nconditions. The extreme poverty of the South, AIDS,\ntuberculosis and malaria are all offensive to human\ndignity. The South's struggle for survival is meaningful\nonly if it finds some response in the North. This\npresupposes recognition of the equality of rights and of\ninequality of means to guarantee these rights.\nIn Africa, initiatives such as the New Partnership\nfor Africa's Development (NEPAD) have been devised\nto address and remedy a socio-economic situation that\nhas led to the most atrocious effects. But we must\nrecognize that NEPAD's viability also depends on the\nNorth's good will to contribute to finding an\nappropriate solution to the main problems of the\nAfrican continent.\nOur countries, on the other hand, place their\nhopes in the recommendations of the World Summit on\nSustainable Development recently held in\nJohannesburg. This world forum took into account the\nhuman being and all the dimensions of life and\nsurvival. In other words, we hope that, by the year\n2015, we will actually see a reduction in poverty by\nhalf, so that we may address priorities other than\nhunger, disease and war, among others.\nThe time has come for our countries to save our\npeoples from the many agonies of war and from\ntraumatic effects on our children and to put an end to\nthe unprecedented losses suffered by our economies\ndue to the exorbitant cost of weapons that harm our\nlives and those of our children. It is time to become\naware of our heavy responsibility to ensure that future\ngenerations are not sacrificed to history.\nFrom another standpoint, war seeks only to prove\none's force to another, and prove one's capacity to\ndestroy. From that perspective, it can only be nefarious.\nThis has led Comorians to banish any attempt to do\nanything that would lead us to confrontation. We\nreinforce our internal forces, which, together with our\nwisdom and the culture of the Comoros, lead us to\nforgive. We base this on our religion, Islam, which\nadvocates tolerance, peace and love of neighbour.\nGuided by these sacred principles, the people of\nComoros, after four years of upheaval in its socio-\npolitical sphere, finally found itself, found\nreconciliation and decided to heal its old wounds.\nThus, on the initiative of President Azali, the various\nparties of the Comoros came to an agreement of\nnational reconciliation, with the support of the\nOrganization of African Unity and the International\nOrganization of la Francophonie.\nFollowing this agreement and after establishing a\nTransitional Government of national unity, pluralistic,\ntransparent and democratic presidential elections for\n27\n\nthe Union of the Comoros and for the islands took\nplace. The contest was run in a legitimate way and the\nwinner was the outgoing President, Colonel Azali\nAssoumani. Following the elections, every island was\ngiven its own president, with full responsibility for\nself-management. Toward the end of this year, we will\nhold legislative elections intended to establish national\ninstitutions and to provide the country with a\nparliament. This next stage is also of crucial\nimportance. In fact, with the establishment of the\nparliaments, we will be able to address and settle many\noutstanding issues not settled by the constitutions of\nthe islands and the Constitution of the Union. These\nconstitutions have often referred to organic laws, which\nmust be enacted by the parliaments.\nWe must recognize that this silence, this absence\nof legislation, may have led to misunderstanding, but\nthis has not interfered with the regular functioning of\nthe administration. Furthermore, commissions have\nbeen established to review modalities that are to enable\nthe progressive transfer of powers to the authorities of\nthe autonomous islands subject to the provisions of the\nvarious constitutions. It is obvious that beginnings are\noften difficult. In these circumstances, this transfer, as\nwell as the procedures for the distribution of State\nproperty, have sometimes met with disagreement from\none quarter or another. This is understandable in a\ncountry that had formerly been managed under a\ndifferent system.\nThis situation can be explained, in our view, by\nthe absence of organic laws that would determine\ndetails of essential aspects currently subject to protest\nby various parties. We trust that with the establishment\nof the Parliament, these misunderstandings will be\nallayed and will yield to the harmony needed to\nmanage the political life of the autonomous islands and\nof the Union.\nI wish to convey the deep appreciation of the\npeople and the Government of the Comoros to all the\nbrotherly and friendly countries and all the regional\nand international institutions which have to date\nsupported us in every respect. Their cooperation has\nbeen indispensable, and, together with the wisdom of\nthe people of the Comoros, has enabled us to avoid the\nworst in a small country where we are all one family.\nWe pay enthusiastic tribute to their actions. Equally, it\nis our wish that crises in other parts of the world will\nhave a satisfactory conclusion. We appeal to all\npartners of the Comoros to continue supporting our\ncountry as it pursues its socio-economic development.\nWithout minimizing the question of the Comorian\nisland of Mayotte, I wish to refer to that subject last of\nall. This is a matter of great concern to the people and\nthe Government of my country. In fact, this is a matter\nof sovereignty, and thus of dignity and patriotic\nconscience, which we cannot abandon, because by\ndoing so we would be abandoning our identity, our\nculture, our civilization, our history and our geography.\nIn our quest for a solution to this problem, a single\nprinciple guides us and a single will moves us to\nresolve this painful dispute with respect for\ninternational law and in accordance with the relevant\nresolutions of the United Nations, while at the same\ntime preserving the benefits we enjoy within the\nframework of our relations with France. In that respect,\nspeaking on behalf of the Government of the Union of\nthe Comoros, I fervently appeal to France to ensure\nthat a dialogue begins.\nThe strategy we advocate has the advantage of\ninsuring that the Comorian Island of Mayotte will not\nremain in isolation, that it will be incorporated into a\nregional framework which will bring it closer to its\nsister islands as well as to its neighbours in the\nsubregion. We therefore hope the same considerations\nwill prevail on the French side so that together we can\nreach an agreement which will guarantee greater calm\nand better understanding within our long-standing\nrelationship.\nWhenever I address this question I recall the great\nTunisian poet Abu al-Qasim al-Shabbi, who invites us\nnot to despair and to rely on reason.\n If people ever want life\nThen time must respond,\nNight must dissipate and shackles\nMust be shattered.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe\ncreation on 24 October 1945 of the family of nations\nbrought the peoples of the world values, principles and\ngoals to cherish and to realize. The founders of the\nUnited Nations brought us hope; they brought us new\nbelief in the future of humanity after two world wars.\nThey opened the eyes of the world community to such\nkey issues as human dignity, equality, tolerance, peace,\nnational and international security, social and economic\nprogress, and respect for human rights.\nHow do we deal with those precious gifts? Do\nwe, the Member countries \u2014 large and small; powerful\nand less powerful; developed, less developed and\ndeveloping \u2014 make the optimal use of those tools to\nshoulder the necessary responsibility and solidarity\nwith one another and with our peoples, in particular the\nmost vulnerable ones among us: our children, older\npersons, persons with disabilities, persons with\nHIV/AIDS, women and men, and older and younger\npersons who are suffering from extreme poverty,\nhunger, deadly diseases, drought and war crimes?\nIn my statement today on behalf of the\nGovernment and the people of the Republic of\nSuriname, in which those fundamental issues should be\naddressed, I would first like to express feelings of\npeace and love to the entire United Nations family:\npeace and love, which was brought to us in the peace\nmessages of the President and of the Secretary-General\nand in the beautiful songs of the United Nations Choir\nduring the Peace Bell Ceremony, held this morning\nhere at Headquarters, on the occasion of the\nInternational Day of Peace; peace and love to you, Mr.\nPresident, because of your unanimous election to that\nhigh Office, because of your readiness to serve and\nbecause of your country's important contribution to the\nlofty goals of the Organization; peace and love to your\npredecessor, Mr. Han Seung-soo, for his energetic\nguidance and leadership during the remarkable fifty-\nsixth session of the General Assembly; and peace and\nlove to the dedicated and inspiring Secretary-General\nand to the entire Secretariat \u2014 those who work actively\nevery day everywhere in the United Nations system\nand who, despite their difficult roles, which include\nsecurity personnel, interpreters, conference officers,\nfield workers, information and communication\ntechnology personnel and personnel in the various\nagencies and programmes, always stand ready to serve\nhumanity with a kind smile.\n\nPeace and love were enshrined in the recent 11\nSeptember message of President Runaldo Ronald\nVenetiaan of the Republic of Suriname to President\nGeorge W. Bush of the United States of America:\n\u201cOn this day, our thoughts and feelings are\nwith the families and friends of the victims of the\ncruel terrorist attack on 11 September 2001, as\nwell as with the Government and people of the\nUnited States of America. The people of\nSuriname pray that the whole of the American\nnation will prosper in peace, together with all of\nthe global family\u201d.\nWe express peace, love and special words of\nwelcome to the newly admitted Swiss Confederation,\nwhich, as of 10 September 2002, has joined our family\nas the 190th Member State, after having served the\nUnited Nations so well as an observer State, especially\nwith respect to the promotion of human rights and the\nprotection of humanitarian law. We also express our\nspecial feelings of love, peace and welcome to the\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste, which will be\nadmitted as the 191st Member State of the United\nNations on 27 September 2002 after a long process of\npreparation, on the basis of Security Council resolution\n1272 (1999), with the strong participation of its own\nwell-motivated people and with the guidance and\nsupport of the international community. We wish the\nGovernments and peoples of both countries well in\ntheir future endeavours.\nLast year, designated as the United Nations Year\nof Dialogue among Civilizations, came at a time in\ntoday's world when dialogue proved to be most\nessential. Suriname is a fervent advocate of dialogue.\nTherefore, we prefer to choose the path of dialogue to\nsolve our disputes. I am pleased to say that the\nSurinamese peoples, who originated in all parts of the\nworld \u2014 in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Europe \u2014\nlive in peace and harmony with one another. We also\ncherish our peaceful and friendly relations with\nneighbouring countries and with many other countries\n27\n\naround the globe. To promote unity in our society, the\nideals of peace and respect for one another's cultures\nare incorporated into our national educational\nprogrammes and are taught from an early age.\nThe human rights based approach to\ndevelopment, including the notion that human rights\neducation is a key to development, should be\nembraced. Therefore, the national education plan of\nSuriname will also deal with human rights education.\nAwareness should be raised that poverty among our\npeoples is a serious violation of their human rights:\nevery human being has the right to an adequate\nstandard of living with regard to health, medical care\nand well-being \u2014 the right to education, to food, to\nhousing and to social services in general.\nSuriname has ratified all major human rights\ninstruments. We welcomed the special attention of the\nCommittee on the Elimination of Discrimination\nagainst Women during the consideration of, among\nother things, Suriname's initial periodic report,\nsubmitted last June, on the importance of human rights\nas a way to transform society and as a birthright. My\ndelegation emphasizes that no equality can be achieved\nunless human rights become a way of life.\nTherefore, on behalf of my Government, I would\nlike to express my heartfelt thanks to the former High\nCommissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary\nRobinson, for the excellent manner in which she\ncarried out her duties. At the same time, we wish to\nwelcome the newly appointed High Commissioner for\nHuman Rights, who is from our region: Mr. Sergio\nVieira de Mello of Brazil.\nWe extend our best wishes to him, and are\nconvinced that he will guide us in promoting and\nprotecting the effective enjoyment by everyone of all\ncivil, cultural, economic, political and social rights,\nincluding the right to development, in accordance with\nGeneral Assembly resolution 48/141.\nIf we indeed want the United Nations to maintain\ninternational peace and security, we need to abide by\nand implement the various resolutions and decisions it\nhas adopted towards this goal. The commitments,\ndeclarations and action plans drafted at the various\nUnited Nations follow-up conferences held this year\nwill have to be implemented. The difference in\npositions of various countries poses a threat to\ninternational peace and security, especially with regard\nto the consequences of trade liberalization for\ndeveloping countries.\nAchieving the Millennium Development Goals\nmust be our first priority, and this achievement should\nnot be jeopardized by an increase in defence\nexpenditures.\nWe welcome Iraq's recently announced decision\nto allow the return of United Nations weapon\ninspectors into the country; we also applaud the\nrecently agreed peace plan that aims to achieve, by\n2005, a final settlement towards a peaceful solution to\nthe conflicts in the Middle East.\nIf we want to guarantee international peace and\nsecurity, we have to live up to the challenge of creating\na world fit for children; a world without child-soldiers;\na society for all ages, where people are no longer\nstarving, dying of famine, drought or living in extreme\npoverty; where there is respect for human rights, the\nrule of law and international law; where there is fair\ntrade, sustainable development, good governance; and\nwhere each individual has the right to development, the\nultimate goal being to improve the quality of life of\nevery human being \u2014 children, women, men, older\npersons and persons with disabilities.\nAccording to the 2002 Human Development\nReport, many countries are poorer than they were 10,\n20, and in some cases, even 30 years ago; genuine\nattention should be given to these most vulnerable\npeople. Developing countries can by no means meet\nthe needs of their people on the basis of their own\nfinancial resources; Governments of the developed\nworld, international financial institutions and donor\ncountries should increase their official development\nassistance.\nPoverty eradication should be a high priority in\nour countries. Our poverty eradication programme is\ndesigned in such a way that it emphasizes not only\nlabour demanding growth, but also, and especially,\ndomestic capital demanding growth. Our Government\nhas confidence in a programme focusing on technology\nand the education of our people to elevate our\npopulation to higher material and spiritual levels.\nEducation is an important vehicle leading to the\nawareness of health problems, such as HIV/AIDS,\nmalaria and tuberculosis, human rights and democracy\nissues, criminality, including cross-boundary crime,\nand drug trafficking. Suriname has a long tradition and\n28\n\nhistory regarding the involvement of civil society and\nother non-State actors in the development of our\ncountry and attaches great importance to real\npartnership between Government, civil society and\nnon-governmental organizations in the fields of social\naffairs, education and health, among others.\nDuring our participation last Monday in the high-\nlevel General Assembly session on the New\nPartnership for Africa's Development, we expressed\nthe solidarity of the Government and People of\nSuriname with our brothers and sisters on the African\ncontinent and our strong support for Africa's\ndetermination to emerge from poverty, hunger and\nfamine, and such destructive deadly diseases as\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, in order to build\na strong and lasting culture of peace and democracy\nbased on Africa's precious natural and human\nresources and its cultural wealth.\nInformation and communication technologies\n(ICT) must be considered as essential for the\nsustainable development of peoples and societies; the\nrights-based approach to development should include\nthe right to information and communication\ntechnologies. ICT has been recognized as an effective\ninstrument in the fields of economic growth,\nknowledge, education at all levels, poverty eradication,\npeople's empowerment, capacity-building, decision-\nmaking and the promotion of sustainable development.\nThe United Nations Secretary-General should be\ncommended for the timely initiative within the United\nNations system to create the United Nations\nInformation and Communication Technologies Task\nForce, which plays a vital role in the preparatory\nprocess for the World Summit on the Information\nSociety in December 2003 in Geneva and 2005 in\nTunis. Various ICT programmes and projects for\nchildren, students, older persons and others, are being\ncarried out in Suriname by the Government, the\nuniversity and civil society.\nMy country will continue to support the work of\nthe United Nations. We are committed to implementing\nthe plans of action of the important follow-up United\nNations Conferences held this year \u2014 namely, the\nSpecial Session on Children, the International\nConference on Financing for Development, the World\nAssembly on Ageing, the World Food Summit and the\nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development.\nThe challenges that we face with regard to\neconomic, social and environmental development are\nto cut poverty in half within the next 10 years. My\nGovernment is committed to working on the economic\ngrowth and poverty eradication of our own people. We\nare also faced with the challenge of improving\nenvironmentally-friendly and healthy products and\nconsumer goods; protecting and managing the natural\nresource base of Suriname; improving the sustainable\ndevelopment of small island developing States; and\nstrengthening the management of sustainable\ndevelopment at the national, regional and international\nlevels.\nBecause Suriname is situated in the Caribbean\nregion, the region with the second highest rate of\nHIV/AIDS-infected people in the world, this issue is of\nutmost importance. Besides HIV/AIDS, malaria and\ntuberculosis pose grave threats not only to health in\ngeneral, but also to the labour sector and to the social\nand economic development of Suriname. We are,\ntherefore, now taking the necessary steps to submit a\nrequest for funding through the United Nations Global\nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.\nWe are faced with a vast amount of issues that\nneed to be solved, and agreements and programmes\nthat need to be implemented in order to improve the\nlives of our peoples. The United Nations still proves to\nbe the best place to collectively discuss the problems of\nthe world and to look for lasting solutions. It is up to us\nto live up to our commitments as Members of the\nUnited Nations and to create better living conditions\nfor our people. We can only hope that this would\neventually lead to stability in and between our\ncountries, and ultimately lead to peace and security, as\nenvisioned by the founders of this great Organization.\nSecretary-General Annan and Assembly President\nKavan, at this morning's Peace Bell ceremony,\nexhorted the international community to heed the\nmessage of International Peace Day and let it resound\nfar and wide, spreading dignity, justice, understanding,\nsolidarity and prosperity.\nLet there be peace on earth. Let peace begin with\nall of us who are assembled in this beautiful, historical\nGeneral Assembly Hall. May the Almighty be with all\nof us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffAllow me\nto begin my statement by expressing the pleasure of the\nGovernment and people of Panama on your well-\ndeserved election, Sir, as President of the General\nAssembly at its fifty-seventh session. We fully\nsupported that election.\nWe value your understanding of most of the\nissues that are the subjects of debate in this world arena\nand the opportunities afforded us by the experience that\nyou have gained in your homeland, along with that in\ngeneral of the peoples of Eastern Europe, a region that,\nin recent years, has been the crucible of the most\ncomplex problems and, at the same time, the most\ninnovative solutions.\nI also pay tribute to the extraordinary work of\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, who has made\nundeniable and productive efforts to achieve\nreconciliation among peoples living in the midst of\nconflict.\nI wish to express my satisfaction at having been\nable to stand with the American people at the\ncommemoration of the first anniversary of the tragic\nevents of 11 September. Images of the moving and,\nabove all, authentic homage paid yesterday morning\nwill remain graven indelibly in my memory. If the\nnationalities of the heroes had been noted along with\ntheir names, we would undoubtedly have understood\nmore clearly that this crime was an assault not only on\nthe United States of America, but on the whole of\nhumankind.\nTerrorism has become the gravest threat to\ninternational security and to the environment of peace\nthat has gradually gained ground throughout the world.\nThis has come at the price of an immense sacrifice in\n13\n\nterms both of human life and of resources that should\nbe devoted to promoting the collective well-being of\nour societies.\nThat is why terrorism must be defeated utterly,\nusing all means available to us, wherever it may be\nfound. With such resolve, Panama has taken specific\nsteps, ratifying the major international instruments\nagainst terrorism and adopting and implementing\ndomestic legal norms designed to control the sources of\nfinancing. In the context of this collective endeavour,\nour country has chaired the Committee on Hemispheric\nSecurity of the Organization of American States,\nseeking thereby to adapt to our realities all instruments\nthat are relevant to this issue, while strengthening\nmechanisms of cooperation in the fight against\nterrorism.\nIn the light of that commitment, on 7 March we\nratified the Rome Statute creating the International\nCriminal Court and deposited our instruments of\nratification with the United Nations on 21 March. We\nfirmly believe that, as stipulated by the Statute, we\nmust end the impunity of those who commit appalling\ncrimes against humanity, regardless of the charges\nbrought by the victims and of the immunities that may\nhave been extended to the perpetrator within or outside\nhis own country.\nHowever, the fight against terrorism and the\nabuse of power that hinders democracy and undermines\nhuman rights must go hand in hand with genuine\ngrowth opportunities for the developing countries.\nThe Republic of Panama has unreservedly\nassumed the commitment to broadly disseminate the\nBeijing Declaration and Platform for Action on\nwomen, as well as to implement the Platform's 12\ncritical areas of concern.\nWe also reaffirm that the progress of nations must\nbe based on sustainable development, guided by the\ncommitments undertaken at Rio de Janeiro and the\nrelevant processes culminating at Johannesburg, with\nall their agreements and initiatives.\nOur foreign policy is based on the fundamental\nvalues of our people, such as the promotion of\ndemocracy and good governance, solidarity and\ninternational cooperation. For that reason, we have\nembraced the free trade option, but, as we indicated in\nMonterrey in March 2002, a more equitable economic\nregime must be consolidated that will enhance\nopportunities for cooperation, address the question of\nour external indebtedness and stimulate free trade\nbased on equity and symmetry.\nIn that context, we currently host the interim\nsecretariat for the Free Trade Area of the Americas,\naspiring, as we have demonstrated, to become the site\nof the permanent secretariat in 2005.\nPanama is moving firmly in the right direction,\naddressing the far-reaching themes of the new\nmillennium with the active participation of society. It is\nmodernizing the State administration, tackling the need\nto modernize its educational and social security\nsystems and developing its rural sector. At the same\ntime, we are beginning to forge a new industrial\nstrategy with tools that will give us access to\ninternational markets on a competitive footing in terms\nof price and quality.\nAt the same time as the Panama Canal is being\nrapidly modernized to respond to the demands of world\ntrade, we are enhancing our democratic stability\nthrough increasingly efficient and transparent\nprocesses. We respect and support human rights,\nparticularly the freedom of expression, and we are\ntaking innovative steps to guarantee a promising future\nfor our society.\nIn the context of all of these initiatives, which are\nrepeated in country after country, the United Nations,\nwithout doubt, will have to play a much more\naggressive role, sustaining and enhancing capacities for\npolitical dialogue and preventing the economic domain\nfrom assuming that role. For that reason, this\nrevitalizing effort must be supplemented with sustained\naction, as has been recommended by the Group of\nLatin American and Caribbean States and other\nregional groups.\nPanama hails the way the Security Council has\nconducted its work over the past year and continues to\nbelieve that this important United Nations organ be\ncomposed of a larger number of members. However, as\nwe did at the fifty-sixth session of the General\nAssembly, we stress today that consideration of\npermanent or non-permanent status must be linked to\njustifications in keeping with the new vision of the\nworld and that changes must not be introduced that\ncould lead to the permanent distribution of privileges\nthat became manifestly obsolete years ago.\n14\n\nLike the rest of the world, we are concerned at\nthe situation in the Middle East, in neighbouring\nColombia and in many other parts of the world where\ninternational support is still being anxiously awaited.\nOur Government believes that the benefits of the\nUnited Nations system and its various bodies must be\nextended to the people of Taiwan, while fostering a\nbroad debate with the aim of beginning formal,\npeaceful negotiations that will lead the people of China\nto resolve existing differences.\nOur delegation is particularly gratified at the\npresence of so many political leaders who have come\nhere in a gesture of fraternal solidarity with all the\ncitizens of the world who were victims of the madness\nand the evil of groups that do not understand the\nadvantages of dialogue and civilized understanding.\nWe will only be able achieve the lofty goals we\nare setting at this forum through the unity of those who\naspire to live in a fraternal, prosperous and peaceful\nworld. May God enlighten us and guide us in the\nsearch for that legitimate aspiration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe\nprofound and dizzying change that took place in the\nworld during the last decade, with the end of the cold\nwar and the acceleration of the process of\nglobalization, did not bring with it the ideal\ninternational society for which we had hoped, and\nworld peace now seems as elusive as ever. That is the\ngreat challenge the Organization must face as we begin\nanother session of the General Assembly, whose\nrelevance as a coordinating body for the international\ncommunity is again being put to the test.\nThe events of September 2001 radically changed\nthe perception of security in the world. The main threat\nto international peace and stability now comes in the\nform of organized multinational clandestine groups\nwhich, having wide access to weapons and financial\nresources, seek to sow terror with a total lack of basic\nhuman feeling.\nDespite its cultural and religious diversity and the\ndiversity of its political systems, and notwithstanding\nthe marked differences in levels of development, the\ninternational community reacted to terrorism with a\ndeep and resolute sense of solidarity, which is reflected\nin its decision to combat it vigorously within the\nframework of international law, through the relevant\nconventions and fulfilment of the obligations stemming\nfrom the Security Council, based on the principles of\nthe Charter and on respect for human rights. In facing\nthat scourge, we must not forget what the President of\nUruguay, Jorge Batlle, said in his address to the\nGeneral Assembly last year in reference to terrorism:\nto fight it, it will also be necessary to move\nagainst other enemies of peace, such as poverty\nand underdevelopment, to give to every person\ngood reason to live and to make all of us\nguardians of humankind, which is a common\ngood from which no one must feel excluded, and\nfor which we must fight unwaveringly'.\n(A/56/PV.44, p. 19)\nIt must also be borne in mind that that ubiquitous\nand anonymous enemy  terrorism  invokes\npolitical pretexts related to unresolved conflicts. In that\nregard, Uruguay reiterates its confidence that the\nPalestinian authorities will show proof of their peaceful\naspirations through their acts. At the same time, we call\non the Government of Israel to make all the efforts\nnecessary to return to the negotiating table, as the only\nway to achieve lasting peace.\nWe retain our optimism in the face of all those\nchallenges. We wish to highlight two positive\ndevelopments that demonstrate that the international\ncommunity is moving in the right direction: the first is\nthe establishment of the International Criminal Court\n(ICC), which will contribute to the maintenance of\npeace by preventing, deterring and punishing the most\nserious international crimes that individuals can\ncommit.\nMy country, Uruguay, by signing and ratifying\nthe Rome Statute, indicated its willingness to\ncontribute to the important process of the development\nand strengthening of international law through the\nestablishment of permanent legal institutions.\nSecondly, the world has this year laid the\ngroundwork for the management of the broad spectrum\nof the positive and negative effects of globalization.\nThe recent Summit on Sustainable Development\nrepresents the culmination of a process that\ncomplements the results of the Monterrey Summit on\nFinancing for Development and the Ministerial\nConference of the World Trade Organization (WTO),\nheld at Doha, which will enable the international\ncommunity to coordinate its efforts to eradicate poverty\nand to promote global development by increasing\n21\n\ndevelopment assistance and liberalizing trade in a\nsustainable manner.\nThe overall conclusion to be drawn from these\nconferences is clear. If the developing countries are not\ngiven equal opportunities and conditions, both with\nrespect to the elimination of subsidies and unfair trade\npractices and with respect to market access, then those\ncountries  the particularly small and developing\ncountries  will continue to suffer the negative effects\nof globalization without enjoying its benefits, thereby\naggravating the political, social and economic situation\nin the vast majority of States in the international\ncommunity. This is the path to deadlock.\nUruguay, with its firm commitment to\nmultilateralism, belongs, at the regional level, to the\nSouthern Common Market (MERCOSUR), together\nwith Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, as well as Bolivia\nand Chile. MERCOSUR, which is now a decade old \nit has been in existence since the Asunci\u00dbn Treaty of\n1991  has established itself as an effective actor\nwithin the international community, going beyond the\ndimension of an economic project to play an active role\nas a stabilizer of democracy in the region, thus\nconsolidating the rule of law and full respect for\nfundamental freedoms and human rights.\nIt is therefore as a member of MERCOSUR that\nUruguay has opted for an ambitious policy of trade\nliberalization characterized by the principle of\ntransparency. It hopes that the other trading blocs in the\ndeveloped world will apply the same principles and\navoid the duplicity inherent in advocating the need to\npromote free trade on the one hand, while at the same\ntime protecting one's markets with discriminatory\npractices. We therefore ask for reciprocity from our\ntrading partners.\nWe must not forget that this is the reason why we\nare now facing increasing difficulty in achieving our\ndevelopment goals. Uruguay, like many other countries\nin other regions of the world, is experiencing an\neconomic and financial crisis that was completely\nunavoidable as a result of the severe impact of\nregional, extra-regional and external factors. This was\nattributable to our increasing dependency on foreign\ntrade, to the fall in the international prices of our\nproducts, to the implementation of subsidies and to\nother protectionist measures by the developed\ncountries, and to the rapid spread of the crisis in the\nfinancial systems of the main exporting markets.\nTo this we must add another tragic irony. Our\nexport products, which are mainly agricultural, cannot\ncompete with similar goods from other countries\nbecause of their higher cost, which results from the fact\nthat Uruguay fulfils all of its international obligations\nin the labour and social fields, particularly with regard\nto child labour, the work of women, the minimum\nwage, social benefits and working conditions.\nNevertheless, the developed countries preach respect\nfor human rights, the strengthening of social security\nand the fulfilment of those obligations, while at the\nsame time purchasing products that are produced at\nlower cost, in violation of international legal\nobligations.\nThe phenomenon of globalization, which has\ndeveloped thus far without a proper cooperation\nframework, appears to be the cause of many of these\nproblems. We continue to believe that it is within this\nOrganization that we must continue to explore ways\nthat will lead to a political solution to the principal\nproblems that we all face.\nOn the one hand the United Nations is the\nobvious body to manage the impact of globalization. In\nthis process of constant change  which is accelerated,\nno doubt, by the technological advances of the so-\ncalled information society  we recognize the\npotential that information technology innovations have\nfor the development of democracy and the economy as\nwell as social progress, and we note with great interest\nthat the World Summit on the Information Society will\nbe held next year.\nFurthermore, we must bring to life once again the\ntrue purpose and meaning of international economic\ncooperation. True solidarity is reflected not only in the\nundertaking of commitments at international summits\nand conferences. It is expressed above all in the\nfaithful discharge of these commitments by each State,\nin particular developed countries. This is the only way\nin which developing countries can move beyond their\nlow levels of progress and achieve sustainable\ndevelopment.\nAll of this requires the introduction of changes in\nthe organs and in the procedures of the United Nations\nin order to ensure better representativity in its structure\nand to enhance the efficiency of its functioning. The\nreform of the Security Council and the revitalization of\nthe General Assembly are tasks that are still pending\nand which we must continue to pursue.\n22\n\nUruguay has confidence in multilateral\nmechanisms for preserving and building international\npeace and security. It is a signatory to the San\nFrancisco Charter and since 1952 has contributed\ntroops to 13 United Nations peacekeeping missions.\nWe take pride in the fact that the more than 1,500\nmembers of our military and police forces currently\nparticipating in peacekeeping operations represent this\nfirm commitment and our belief in this Organization.\nTherefore Uruguay shares in its entirety the\neloquent and passionate advocacy of multilateralism\nreflected in the Secretary-General's statement last week\nin this very Hall. Like Mr. Kofi Annan, the people and\nthe Government of Uruguay reaffirm their genuine\ncommitment to multilateralism, deeply rooted in our\nspirit and based on principle, on tradition and on\nconviction.\nThe most recent political developments, in terms\nof the crisis posed by Iraq, is in our view proof of the\nneed for balance which can be achieved only within the\nframework of mutilateralism.\nIn conclusion, I should like to warmly and\nsincerely congratulate you, Sir, on the manner in which\nyou have been accomplishing your work, which we\nknow will be successful. We also welcome the two new\nMembers who are joining the Organization  the\nSwiss Confederation and Timor-Leste. We know that\nunder your leadership, this will be a fruitful and\nsuccessful session of the Assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf\nof the Government of the Republic of Moldova, I join\nother delegations in congratulating Mr. Jan Kavan on\nhis election as the President of the fifty-seventh session\nof the General Assembly. I would also like to express\nmy sincere thanks to his predecessor, Mr. Han Seung-\nsoo, for the competent manner in which he managed\n24\n\nthis forum during the dramatic period of the previous\nsession.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to\nwelcome the Swiss Confederation as a Member of our\nfamily of nations. We look forward to welcoming East\nTimor as the 191st Member of the United Nations in\nthe near future.\nOne year after the terrible attacks of 11\nSeptember, we remember the innocent victims of those\ncrimes. As a result of that tragedy, the world changed\nfundamentally in many ways. The international\ncommunity agreed to start fighting terrorism in all its\nforms. The international anti-terrorism coalition, led by\nthe United States, succeeded in significantly\nundermining the capacity of the Al-Qaeda terrorist\norganization and in removing the Taliban regime,\nwhich had hosted it. The General Assembly and the\nSecurity Council took prompt action resulting in\nmandatory measures aimed at eliminating all forms and\nmanifestations of terrorism and requiring Member\nStates to take administrative, financial, legal and other\nsteps. The immediate, effective and, even more\nimportant, united action by the United Nations against\na terrorist threat that had now reached a new level\nshows the Organization's continued importance and\nviability. Once more, we saw the capacity of the United\nNations to fulfil its noble mission by uniting and\nmobilizing us for this relentless fight.\nThe Republic of Moldova supports those actions\nand reaffirms its commitment to fighting terrorism in\nall its forms. My country has been taking concrete\naction towards the implementation of all relevant\nUnited Nations decisions, especially Security Council\nresolutions 1373 (2001) and 1390 (2002). First,\nconcrete steps have been taken to consolidate our\ndomestic anti-terrorist legislation. Moldova presented\ntwo relevant reports to the Counter-Terrorism\nCommittee. Only months after those tragic events, our\nParliament adopted a law to combat terrorism and a\nlaw to prevent and combat money-laundering. Relevant\nmodifications were introduced to the Criminal Code.\nWith its recent accession to the International\nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombing\nand to the International Convention against the Taking\nof Hostages, as well as its ratification[n of the\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of the\nFinancing of Terrorism, Moldova is about to conclude\nits process of acceding to the 12 main international\ninstruments related to combating terrorism. We call on\nall Member States to undertake new efforts to conclude\nthe United Nations Comprehensive Convention on\nInternational Terrorism.\nAt the same time, as a new independent State, we\nask for expert support in implementing some of those\ncomplex measures. Moldova has shown its political\nwill to combat terrorism by actively participating in\nnew efforts within the framework of many regional and\nsubregional organizations, including the Organization\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe; the\nCommonwealth of Independent States; the Stability\nPact for South-East Europe; the South-East Europe\nCooperative Initiative; and the Georgia, Uzbekistan,\nUkraine, Azerbaijan and Moldova Group.\nThe stabilization and rehabilitation process in\nAfghanistan is a test for the Organization and for the\nrest of the international community. Considerable\nprogress has been achieved, and we must commend the\njob done by the anti-terrorism coalition under very\ndifficult conditions, the efforts of international donors\nand, above all, the efforts of the Afghanistan\nleadership, led by President Hamid Karzai. The Special\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for\nAfghanistan, Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi, has\nrepeatedly urged the international community to\nmaintain its strong and active support for the\nGovernment and people of Afghanistan. We share the\nview that stability for Afghanistan must be seen within\nthe context of a broader stabilization process that\nsecures increased support from international financial\norganizations for all Central Asian countries.\nUndoubtedly, there is an urgent need for more\nsubstantial efforts to bring an end to the Middle East\nconflict. This year has been marked by successive\nterrorist attacks on Israeli civilians and by Israel's\ndisproportionate use of force against the Palestinians.\nWe support the efforts of the Quartet to restart the\npeace process on the basis of the relevant United\nNations resolutions in order to achieve the peaceful\ncoexistence of Israel and an independent Palestinian\nState within secure and internationally recognized\nborders.\nWe share the concern expressed by many\nprevious speakers on the situation concerning Iraq, and\nwe call on Baghdad to comply immediately and fully\nwith all relevant Security Council resolutions. In that\nregard, we welcome the statement made recently in this\nHall by President Bush recognizing the central role of\n25\n\nthe United Nations and calling on it to shoulder its\nresponsibility. Moldova, a country with an economy in\ntransition, attaches great importance to the United\nNations agenda for development and, in particular, the\nimplementation of the United Nations Millennium\nDeclaration. The International Conference on\nFinancing for Development held in Monterrey this\nyear, the Doha Development Agenda and the World\nSummit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg\nconstituted an essential step in the convergence of\ninternational efforts in such vital areas as the\neradication of poverty and the reversal of\nenvironmental and resource degradation.\nThe external debt burden, the lack of necessary\nresources, weak financial and banking systems,\nfrequent natural calamities and droughts are\nundermining many of the efforts made by our\nGovernments. Unfortunately, some recommendations\nimplemented at the request of and at the insistence of\nsome international financial institutions have proved to\nbe relatively, or even totally, ineffective. While they\naccept primary responsibility for the well-being of their\ncitizens, many Governments in the developing world\nare still waiting for promised resources.\nMy country welcomes the entry into force on 1\nJuly of this year of the Rome Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), which inaugurated\na new era in the affirmation of fundamental human\nrights on the world stage. Moldova has begun\npreparations to join the ICC, which we believe will\nbecome an effective, competent and equitable legal\ninstrument.\nThe recent debates in the General Assembly on\nthe New Partnership for Africa's Development\n(NEPAD) demonstrate that the world strongly supports\nthe unprecedented integration processes taking place\non the African continent.\nThe Republic of Moldova welcomes the creation\nof the African Union. We share the view that the\nUnited Nations and the entire international community\nmust remain fully engaged in resolving the conflicts\nthat still prevail in many parts of Africa.\nConflict prevention is the central challenge facing\nour Organization. The Secretary-General called for the\nUnited Nations to move from a culture of reaction to a\nculture of prevention. Poverty, inequality and injustice\nare most frequently named as causes of conflicts.\nSeparatism is also one of the phenomena provoking\ninstability and conflicts in many parts of the world.\nWhile we are mentioning the improvement in the\nBalkan situation, there are still a number of so-called\nfrozen conflicts in the post-Soviet area, creating\ninstability in the entire region. Despite many years of\nnegotiations the separatist regime in Transdniestria\ncontinues blatantly to ignore any efforts made by the\nMoldovan Government, the Organization for Security\nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and other\ncountries, to oppress the local population and violate\nelementary human rights. By creating new obstacles to\nthe process of removing ammunitions and weapons, the\nTransdniestrian separatist regime is putting at risk the\nfulfilment of the Istanbul OSCE Summit decision,\nwhich was reaffirmed by United Nations General\nAssembly resolution 55/179 concerning the withdrawal\nof all foreign forces and armaments from the territory\nof the Republic of Moldova by the end of this year.\nAnother reason for our deep concern is the\nexistence of a huge quantity of unregistered arms at the\ndisposal of paramilitary units. At industrial sites of the\nformer Soviet military complex in that region, the\nseparatist authorities produce different types of\nweapons, which are delivered through third countries\nto other areas of conflict, thus assisting terrorist and\ncriminal groups, as well as other separatist regimes.\nThe considerable changes that have occurred\nrecently in the international arena have highlighted the\noverwhelming role that the United Nations must play in\norder to consolidate democratic values and institutions\nand ensure peace and stability. My delegation fully\nsupports the efforts made by Secretary-General Kofi\nAnnan toward reforming our Organization. Some steps\nhave been taken to revitalize the work of the General\nAssembly. The reform of the Security Council will\nmake it more equitable and consistent with the\nexpansion of the international community and will\nbetter reflect new realities. We support the expansion\nof permanent and non-permanent membership, so as to\nlet those Member States that are willing and able, to\nbetter contribute to the maintenance of international\npeace and stability.\nThe United Nations has also contributed to the\neconomic and social development of my country.\nUnited Nations agencies and especially the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) have\nactively participated in the implementation of many\nimportant programmes, thus finding lasting solutions to\nmany challenges and helping our young democracy to\n26\n\nsurvive. We also commend the activity of UNICEF in\nMoldova for helping the newest generation of our\ncitizens navigate through this difficult period of\ntransition.\nIn conclusion, I would like to take this\nopportunity to express my Government's warmest\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for the efforts he\nhas exerted in order to maintain peace and security and\nfor his outstanding contribution to promoting and\nfostering the role of the United Nations. The award of\nthe centennial Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations\nand its Secretary-General was highly welcomed all\nover the world.\nIn this year's annual report on the work of the\nOrganization the Secretary-General writes:\n\u201cDevelopments during the past year have\naffirmed the Organization's increasing relevance\nin world affairs; but a review of the work of the\nOrganization is also a reminder that much still\nneeds to be done to achieve the aims and goals of\nthe Charter and the Millennium Declaration.\u201d\n(A/57/1; para. 230)\nLet us work even harder to ensure that the United\nNations is able to meet the challenges of the twenty-\nfirst century.\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffNot very far from here stood\ntwo towers that symbolized freedom, prosperity and\nprogress. Halfway around the globe stood two\nmagnificent Buddhas that represented a culture of\ntolerance and a nation with a rich history. These\nsymbols have now been linked together through the\nglobal scourge of terrorism. Terror may have\ndemolished these physical structures, yet it served to\nstrengthened the resolve of the international\ncommunity never to abandon the spirit and\ndetermination with which these icons were built.\nTerrorism and violence are against the teaching of\nIslam; a religion that stands for peace, respect for\nhuman dignity, dialogue, and tolerance. The Taliban,\nwho destroyed our country and cultural heritage, did\nnot represent Afghans, nor does the Al-Qaida represent\nthe Arab world. Even more, neither one represents\nIslam.\nThe Afghan people, as the prime victims of war\nand violence, and the front line fighters against\nterrorism, particularly appreciate, honour and admire\nthe friendly hand extended to them by the United States\nof America and other members of the anti-terror\ncoalition, the International Security Assistance Force\n(ISAF), the United Nations Organization, particularly\nthe Secretary-General Kofi Annan  whom I must\nthank for his kind remarks and support of Afghanistan\nthis morning  as well as Ambassador Lakhdar\nBrahimi, the Special Representative of the Secretary-\nGeneral, for their tremendous support to Afghanistan\nduring this critical juncture of Afghan history.\nSir, I am honoured to have this opportunity to\nhighlight some achievements of my Administration\nduring the brief course of the past eight months. First,\nthe implementation of the Bonn Agreement and the\npeace process in my country are quite on track. In\naccordance with the terms of the Bonn Agreement, the\npeople of Afghanistan manifested their robust\nresolution and solid consensus for democracy and the\nrule of law by gathering under one tent to convene the\nemergency Loya Jirga  that is the Afghan Grand\nCouncil  held on 11 to 17 June 2002. The success of\nthe Loya Jirga, with broad and unprecedented\nparticipation of women, was a significant milestone in\nthe recent history of Afghanistan, and a major step\nforward in the process of peace, stability and nation-\nbuilding. During the proceeding of the Loya Jirga,\nhundreds of delegates exercised their right to free\nspeech and expressed their desire for security, peace,\nnational unity, reconstruction, democracy and good\ngovernance.\nThe people of Afghanistan told me univocally of\ntheir disdain for war and violence. The Loya Jirga\ndemonstrated that after 23 years of imposed wars,\nforeign interventions, violence, bloodshed, repression,\ndestruction and subversion, Afghans are on the way to\nenjoy peace and benefit from reconstruction. Hence,\nthey are determined to take every measure to avoid a\nrelapse into warlordism and lawlessness.\nSecondly, as a result of the back-to-school\ncampaign, schools that were closed for over six years,\nwhen neither boys nor girls went to school, have\nreopened. Three million children from all over the\ncountry, both boys and girls, have returned to school.\nThirdly, the strong commitment of the\nGovernment to the eradication of poppy cultivation and\nthe destruction of narcotics resulted in the burning of\ndrugs worth an estimated street value of 8 billion\ndollars.\nFourthly, as a sign of stability and security, we\nare very glad to have over 1.6 million of our refugees,\nwho were mainly living in Pakistan and Iran, return\nhome in a period of less than seven to eight months.\nFifthly, we have formed a Constitutional\nCommission to undertake the historic task of drafting\nthe country's new Constitution. We have already\nestablished a Judicial Commission, to rebuild the\nAfghan justice system, a Civil Service Commission to\nreform the entire administration and impose a merit-\nbased system, as well as a Human Rights Commission\nto protect human rights, women's rights and civil\nliberties. We have also adopted a series of laws and\ndecrees to promote and attract domestic and\ninternational investments, safeguard property rights\n\n\nand other pillars of the free market economy, combat\nnarcotics, and protect the forests and the environment.\nSixthly, despite these achievements, we are\nrealistic about countless challenges and problems that\nwe are confronted with. Foremost among them is\nsecurity; a principal demand of the Afghan people, and\nthe most fundamental requirement for sustainable\npeace. It is the position of my Government that the real\nkey to the restoration of sustainable security lies in the\ncreation of a national army and a national police\nforce, along with a comprehensive demobilization\nprogramme.\nWe have established a commission for the\nformation of a national army. I have also highlighted\nthe establishment of the national army and police force\nas a top priority and the main objective of my\nGovernment; but the people of Afghanistan need a\nclear commitment and sustained support from the\ninternational community to realize these objectives.\nWe appreciate the contributions of our American,\nBritish, German, Turkish and French friends in training\nour national army and police force, and the\nGovernment of Japan for its assistance in\ndemobilization programmes. I would like to once again\nrequest the donor countries to further support our\nstrategy for the creation of a national army and a\nnational system for security by translating international\npledges into concrete contributions.\nThe Afghan delegates from various provinces that\nregularly come to Kabul to discuss various matters\nwith our Administration, strongly request the\nexpansion of the International Security Assistance\nForce (ISAF) to other parts of the country. They want\nto be certain that Afghanistan will not be once again\nleft alone by the international community.\nWe owe particular gratitude to the donor\ncommunity for its assistance to Afghanistan, but would\nalso like to remind our friends that the majority of the\nfinancial pledges made to Afghanistan at the Tokyo\nConference are still unfulfilled. We have presented the\ndonor countries with our National Development\nFramework to indicate our priorities, help manage the\nreconstruction programmes effectively, and channel\nfinancial resources to national capacity building. It is\nthe position of my Government that the consolidation\nof peace and stability depends on the international\ncommunity's sustained engagement in providing\nfunding for reconstruction.\nImplementation of labour-intensive projects\nthroughout Afghanistan has a direct influence on\nsecurity and the demobilization of combatants. Despite\nthese facts, the level of direct financial support\nprovided to the Afghan Government can be\ncharacterized as insufficient, especially given the\ngenerosity of donors at the Tokyo Conference, where\nover $4.5 billion dollars were pledged to support\nAfghanistan. The Afghan people urgently needs the\npledges in Tokyo to be turned into cash.\nWhile we agree that there is still a humanitarian\ncrisis in Afghanistan, I would like to request the\ninternational community to focus more on\nreconstruction, to support long-term recovery efforts,\nand to treat the causes of poverty, rather than its\nsymptoms. Building highways and repairing the road\nnetworks in Afghanistan is an important undertaking\nwith significant economic, political and social impact\nfor the Afghan people. It creates jobs, helps with\nsecurity and demobilization, provides better\nconnectivity, strengthens national unity and assists with\nthe reintegration of Afghanistan into the regional\neconomy.\nWhile the world has now clearly voiced its unity\nto honour the dignity of life and reconstruction over\nterror, destruction and subversion, the threat posed by\nthe terrorist groups requires resolute commitment on\nthe part of all nations to fight this evil to the end. I\nwarned the world before the 11 September tragedy\nabout the dangers of terrorism. The Afghan people\nhave suffered tremendously at the hands of the Taliban\nand terrorist groups. They killed many thousands of our\npeople, destroyed villages and burned orchards and\nvineyards.\nAfghanistan is a Muslim country and the people\nof Afghanistan truly believe in the teachings of Islam,\nwhich is based on peace, justice, equality, moderation\nand tolerance, and reject any abuse and misuse of the\nholy name of Islam by extremist groups to justify\nviolence, death and destruction. My vision of\nAfghanistan is of a modern State that builds on our\nIslamic values, promoting justice, the rule of law,\nhuman rights and freedom of commerce, and forming a\nbridge between cultures and civilizations  a model of\ntolerance and prosperity based on the rich heritage of\nthe Islamic civilization.\nAfghanistan is committed to continuing to have\nfriendly relations with its neighbours and the\n12\n\ninternational community and to being a resilient\npartner in the war against terrorism. The establishment\nof security and prosperity within Afghanistan is a\nmeans of promoting security and prosperity in the\nregion and the world as a whole. We do not want to\nlive in the past and are determined not to let the events\nof the past harm our relations with our neighbours. We\nextend a sincere hand of friendship to all our\nneighbours on the basis of mutual respect for\nsovereignty, territorial integrity, independence and non-\ninterference in the internal affairs of each other. We\nwill never permit our soil to be used for any subversive\nactivities against any of our neighbours or countries in\nthe region, and we expect others to do the same.\nWe are deeply concerned about the loss of\ninnocent lives in Palestine and Israel. We strongly\nsupport the realization of the right of self-\ndetermination of the people of Palestine. We also\nsupport the relevant United Nations resolutions and the\nSaudi Arabian-sponsored declarations in Beirut. We are\nalso concerned about the dispute between our friends\nand neighbours, India and Pakistan. We have good\nrelationships with both those countries. The people of\nAfghanistan know the high price of war and violence\nand are yearning for peace, stability and prosperity in\nthe region. They know that a peaceful resolution of the\nissues between Pakistan and India is an urgent\nnecessity to consolidate peace and security in the\nregion and the world at large.\nIn conclusion, I would like to take this\nopportunity to congratulate Switzerland and East Timor\non joining the family of the United Nations, and extend\nmy appreciation to Iran and Pakistan, our neighbouring\ncountries, for having accepted millions of our refugees\nfor over two decades and for having looked after them.\nWe are very grateful to both these neighbours. We are\nalso very grateful to the donor countries for having\nhelped Afghanistan and to the international\norganizations that have helped us over the past many\nmonths and years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me first of all convey greetings and wishes of\npeace and prosperity to the people of your countries\nfrom the President of Turkmenistan, Saparmurat\nNiyazov.\nAllow me to congratulate the President on the\noccasion of his election to such a high and responsible\npost and wish him success in the organization of the\nfruitful work of the fifty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly.\nI would also like to welcome the Swiss\nConfederation and Timor-Leste on their membership\nthis year in the United Nations.\nFrom the first days of its independent\ndevelopment, neutral Turkmenistan has cooperated\nclosely with the United Nations and considers that\ncooperation the main direction for its foreign policy.\nThe key issue for Turkmenistan as a neutral\ncountry in such conditions is cooperation  in the name\nof peace and security and the well-being and prosperity\nof its people. We constantly feel that we have the\nsupport of the United Nations for our foreign policy\ninitiatives aimed at strengthening these goals. Our\ncommitment to these international obligations as a\npermanently neutral State remains unchanged.\nThe importance of promoting the role of the\nUnited Nations is constantly becoming more obvious\nagainst the background of current developments of\nboth global and regional processes where the\nconcentration of collective efforts and the adoption of\ndecisions that take into account various interests are\nrequired. Turkmenistan stands for strengthening and\nbroadening the role of the United Nations in the\nsolution not only of global problems, but also in the\ncollective discussion of regional issues and for a more\nextensive use of the potential of the United Nations and\nits institutions in proposing and implementing foreign\npolicy initiatives.\nWe see huge opportunities in the close\ncooperation of the United Nations and its specialized\nbodies in the implementation of the large-scale national\nprojects. In this context we express our gratitude for\nthe cooperation of the leadership of the United Nations\nand its specialized agencies, such as the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), the United Nations\nChildren's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations\nPopulation Fund (UNFPA), the Office of the United\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),\nthe United Nations International Drug Control\nProgramme (UNDCCP) and others. In cooperation with\nthese agencies, the Government of Turkmenistan is\ncarrying out a number of large projects of social and\neconomic orientation that are producing specific results\nin the areas of health care, social affairs, education,\nenvironment and other areas.\nMore than a year has passed since the tragic\nevents of 11 September 2001, which forced us to\nevaluate the issues of security of our people and our\nStates through a qualitatively new scale of\nmeasurement and has confirmed the necessity to\nconsolidate efforts in this direction.\nIn this context the region of Central Asia has\ncome to the forefront of the world's attention. In many\n30\n\nrespects the prospects for peace and security will\ndepend on the way multilateral dialogue develops on\nthese issues in the region.\nTurkmenistan attaches foremost importance to the\nrole of the United Nations in invigorating regional and\ninterregional dialogue in the search for solutions to\nemerging problems. In this connection I would like to\ndraw your attention to the initiative of the President of\nTurkmenistan in creating a regional consultative\ncouncil of the heads of Government of the countries of\nCentral Asia. This would be a high-level interstate\nbody for regular consultations and the development of\njoint decisions on matters that touch directly upon the\ndestinies of the States in the region and the real needs\nof their people.\nPrimarily, these issues would include trade and\neconomic interaction, energy supply, cross-border\ntrade, water use, transportation and humanitarian\ncooperation. We believe that multilateral consultations\non the part of heads of State will contribute to the\ndevelopment and implementation of agreed actions by\nthe parties, on the basis of mutual interests, and will\nenable the creation of a maximally effective system of\nrational interaction.\nIn this regard, the initiative of the President of\nTurkmenistan, Mr. Niyazov, to hold an international\nconference in Turkmenistan on economic cooperation\nin Central and South Asia, with the participation of\nrepresentatives from the region, the United States,\nRussia, China, Japan, countries of the European Union,\nother interested States, and international financial and\neconomic institutions, can be considered to be very\ntimely.\nSuch a forum will promote a new system of\neconomic ties between West and East based on joint\nand equal cooperation of States. Its main goal should\nbe creation of the most favourable conditions for trade,\ninvestment activities, and the introduction of modern\ntechnology. Moreover, holding such an international\nconference will make it possible for developed\ncountries to assess the real potential for industrial and\nsocial development of States in Central and South Asia.\nThe beginning of work on the trans-Afghan gas\npipeline projects using the \u201cTurkmenistan-Afghanistan-\nPakistan\u201d route is of great importance in developing\nregional cooperation. The agreement for the\nconstruction of the new gas pipeline was signed in May\nof this year, in Islamabad, by the Presidents of\nTurkmenistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan.\nTurkmenistan welcomes the interest shown in this\nproject by large companies, financial and industrial\ngroups, and first of all by the Asian Development\nBank, which is taking an active part in the negotiating\nprocess for the implementation of the trans-Afghan gas\npipeline project.\nThe trans-Afghan gas pipeline is a project on an\ninternational scale that has colossal social, economic\nand political significance, primarily from the point of\nview of strengthening stability and security in the\nregion. The trans-Afghan gas pipeline, of which more\nthan 700 kilometres would be laid through\nAfghanistan, has, in addition to its economic\ncomponent, an invaluable social and humanitarian\nsignificance. The construction of the gas pipeline\nwould create jobs for more than 12 thousand Afghans\nand would also offer a new social infrastructure for\nAfghanistan.\nIn this connection we call on the United Nations\nto assist us in the effective implementation of this\nproject. Turkmenistan had suggested earlier, from the\nsame rostrum, the development and adoption, under the\nUnited Nations auspices, of an international convention\non operating regimes and guarantees for interstate\npipelines. Such an instrument would, in our view, allow\nus to create a reliable political and legal mechanism for\nproviding the safe transportation of critical raw\nmaterials to world markets.\nTurkmenistan's foreign policy of positive\nneutrality is aimed at ensuring secure development and\ncooperation aimed at social revival in the countries of\nthe region. This entails the creation of new workplaces\nand fighting against poverty, in other words, everything\nthat today embraces the human dimension.\nTurkmenistan supports the conclusions reached at\nthe recent Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment. We feel that solutions to current world\nproblems, especially in the humanitarian, social and\nenvironmental areas, will require a new approach to the\nhuman dimension in world politics.\nIn the 21st century, the notion of sustainable\ndevelopment has acquired a qualitatively new meaning\nbased on steady and stable economic growth. On of the\nimportant aspects of sustainable development is\nmaintaining a balance between, on one hand, industrial\n31\n\nand technological progress and, on the other, protection\nof the environment. The realization of this necessity is\nespecially relevant today, when this balance is\nbreached throughout the world.\nThe international community is striving to\nprevent negative, technology-generated consequences\non the environment. A vivid example of that is the\nKyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change. Turkmenistan, having\nacceded to that important international instrument, is\ntaking an active role in implementing its norms and\nprinciples, and is cooperating with international\norganizations.\nIn the 21st century, the problem connected with\nthe huge deposits of hydrocarbon resources in the basin\nof the Caspian Sea, which involves not only the\ncountries of the region but also many other countries\nand multinationals, has come to the attention of the\nworld. It is now known that the deposits of oil and gas\nin the Caspian Sea are the most important energy\nresources of the 21st century. Their efficient\ndevelopment, along with the creation of the necessary\npipeline infrastructure for bringing energy resources to\nthe world markets, will ensure significant economic\ngrowth for many States and ensure the well-being of\ntheir people. It is obvious that many countries are\ninterested in the security of the energy resources\ntransit. The United Nations should play an important\nrole in this process.\nThe first summit meeting of the Caspian littoral\nStates in Ashgabat in April of this year, on the\ninitiative of the President of Turkmenistan, could be\nconsidered as a qualitatively new stage in this process\nof agreeing on and developing a mutually acceptable\nsolution to the Caspian problem. At this historic\nsummit, Presidents expressed the will of their State and\npeople, which is to ensure that the Caspian Sea be and\nremain a sea of friendship and peace. The result of the\nsummit is that the Caspian theme was openly discussed\nfor the first time at such a high level. Strong agreement\nwas reached that problems are to be resolved\npeacefully and constructively. Thus, the first step\ntowards a common goal \u2014 the determination of the\nstatus of the Caspian Sea \u2014 was made.\nIt is obvious today that effective cooperation and\nactivities relating to the Caspian Sea as a whole are\ndirectly connected with ensuring stability in the\nCaspian region. Turkmenistan hopes that the Caspian\nregion will achieve peace, stability and durable\ncooperation on the basis of justice and mutual respect.\nWe need collective efforts in order to solve the\nproblems of the international community. The solution\nof these problems is possible, not through collective\nefforts alone, but also through the assumption by each\nmember of the international community of its\nindividual role and responsibilities. This is the logic\nguiding the political behaviour of Turkmenistan in its\npursuit of the goals of strengthening peace and\neconomic, social and cultural development. Our\ncountry is always ready for constructive partnership.\nThe United Nations can rest assured in that respect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffLet me begin by\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your assumption of the\nPresidency of the fifty-seventh session of the General\nAssembly. My delegation is confident that, given your\nvast political skills, you will execute your\nresponsibility as President of the fifty-seventh session\nof the United Nations General Assembly most\nhonourably.\nMy delegation pledges its total support and\ncooperation to you in the discharge of your important\nresponsibilities. You can depend on Zambia's support\nand cooperation.\nMay I also take this opportunity to pay tribute to\nyour predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Han Seung-soo\nof the Republic of Korea, for the excellent manner in\n4\n\nwhich he presided over the fifty-sixth session of the\nUnited Nations General Assembly.\nMy delegation also congratulates the Secretary-\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Kofi Annan, for the able\nmanner in which he has steered the work of the United\nNations.\nWe are happy to welcome Switzerland and East\nTimor as new Members of the United Nations family.\nMy delegation looks forward to working closely with\nthe two new Member States.\nThree days ago, the world commemorated the 1st\nanniversary of the tragic events of 11 September 2001.\nThe past year has witnessed a global resolve to fight\ninternational terrorism. My Government wishes to join\nthe host country in remembering the tragic events of 11\nSeptember 2001.\nMy delegation salutes the efforts of the United\nNations in ensuring that there is peace in the world. I\nam pleased to note that there are signs of positive\ndevelopments in most of the trouble spots where there\nhave been conflicts.\nThe African Union and the international\ncommunity have to work together as partners in\nconflict prevention and peace-building. In the past\nforty years, Africa has lost too much blood through\nconflicts. Zambia is ready and willing to play her part\nto create in Africa a culture of respect for the rule of\nlaw and human rights, social and economic\ndevelopment, and to promote peace and security. In\nthis regard we welcome the positive signs towards\npeace in Angola, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of\nCongo and other conflict areas in Africa.\nThe search for peace is a continuous process. I\ntherefore appeal to the international community to\ncontinue extending assistance to bring about peace in\nthe conflict areas around the world.\nIt is against this background that my Government\nwelcomes the implementation of the Lusaka Peace\nProtocol in Angola and the Democratic Republic of\nCongo. Since the death of Dr. Jonas Savimbi, the\nformer UNITA rebel leader, in February 2002, the\nprospects for peace in that country and the entire\nsubregion are encouraging.\nThe ceasefire agreement, signed between the\nAngolan Government and the UNITA military, further\npaved way for the implementation of the Lusaka Peace\nProtocol of November 1994.\nThe full implementation of the Lusaka Protocol is\nvital for the reintegration of Angola in the Southern\nAfrican economy and the promotion of regional peace\nand stability. The people of Angola require the moral\nand material support of the international community to\ncomplete that process.\nI would like also to express my country's\nappreciation to the United Nations Security Council for\nthe measures being undertaken to strengthen the United\nNations Organization Mission in the Democratic\nRepublic of Congo (MONUC). I am further gratified\nthat the efforts by His Excellency Sir Ketumile Masire,\nformer President of Botswana, to promote internal\npolitical dialogue are bearing fruit. I also wish to note,\nwith appreciation, that the number of foreign troops\nstill on Democratic Republic of Congo soil has been\nsignificantly reduced.\nConflicts have a negative impact on the economic\nlife of the region. To Zambia, as a host to refugees\nfrom Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nand other parts of the continent, the recent signs of\npeace are significantly important. My Government\nhopes that these positive signs will result in the\nvoluntary repatriation of refugees to their countries.\nCurrently, there are 270,000 refugees in designated\ncamps and about 120,000 others who are\nsimultaneously settled in the border areas among the\nlocal people in Zambia. My Government will continue\nto require the material and financial support of the\ninternational community to help in the refugee\nmanagement effort.\nSince the thirty-seventh session of the Assembly\nof the former Organization of African Unity, held in\nLusaka in July 2001, Africa has continued to refine its\npartnerships with the rest of the world to foster\ndevelopment. The vehicle for this effort is the New\nPartnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). I wish\nto convey my Government's appreciation to the leaders\nof the Group of 8 for endorsing the NEPAD programme\nduring their annual meeting, held in Kananaskis,\nCanada, on 27 June 2002. I note with appreciation that\nthe G8 countries considered positively the request by\nthe four-nation African representatives of Algeria,\nNigeria, Senegal and South Africa, that they earmark\nfor Africa 50 per cent of their projected foreign aid\nincreases in the coming years. I wish to thank the\n5\n\nEuropean Union, which has supported the NEPAD\nprogramme and remains committed to its pledge of\nsupport for the initiative.\nThe past year has seen practical and positive\ndevelopments in the response of the cooperating\npartners to African trade liberalization initiatives. In\nthis regard, I wish to take this opportunity to welcome\nthe initiative of the United States Government to refine\nthe scope of the African Growth and Opportunity Act\nto increase the number of products eligible to be\nexported to the United States.\nIn the health sector, Africa is experiencing the\ncatastrophic impact of a combination of the HIV/AIDS\npandemic and a series of outbreaks of such diseases as\nmalaria, tuberculosis and diarrhoea. Unfortunately, my\ncountry is one of those hard hit in this regard. Although\nmy Government has implemented health reforms that\nfocus on ameliorating the situation, far more resources\nare required to address the problem.\nMy Government has taken a decision to acquire\naffordable antiretroviral drugs for distribution to\npeople affected with AIDS. My delegation wishes to\nexpress its gratitude to our cooperating partners, who\nhave been forthcoming in providing resources for this\neffort. Early deaths from HIV/AIDS-related illnesses\nare robbing the country of skilled professionals and\ncreating large numbers of orphaned children.\nAs members are aware, a combination of natural\nand other factors has caused a food shortage and crisis\nin the southern African subregion. In response to this\nimpending catastrophe, on 18 July 2002 the United\nNations World Food Programme launched an appeal for\nfood aid in support of the affected areas. In response to\nthe food shortage, a number of countries and\ninternational organizations have pledged their support.\nMy delegation pays tribute to the United Nations and\nother cooperating partners in providing assistance to\nZambia to mitigate the food shortfall.\nHowever, it has come to the Government's\nattention that some of the food aid products offered to\nZambia constituted genetically modified organisms\n(GMOs). The offer of genetically modified foods has\ncreated a difficult situation for the Government. While,\non the one hand, we are determined to procure food\nand seed for the mostly rural population that is hardest\nhit by the food shortage, we have expressed concern\nover the true impact of GMOs on our people and soil.\nDue to our low scientific and technological base,\nGovernment has opted for the procurement of non-\nGMO food products. It is not my Government's\nintention to sacrifice the lives of the Zambian people\nby taking this position. However, given the lack of and\noften conflicting international information on the\npossible effects of genetically modified products on\nhumans, I therefore wish to request Members'\nunderstanding of Zambia's position on GMOs. In this\nregard, my Government has accepted an offer from the\nUnited States Government for Zambian scientists to\nvisit America to study first-hand the GMO factor. Their\nfindings will help us to map out a way forward and to\nmake informed decisions and choices.\nIn conclusion, I wish the General Assembly at its\nfifty-seventh session successful deliberations of the\nissues before it. I wish to appeal to all Member States\nto ensure the rapid implementation of decisions\nemanating therefrom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffThe current Chairman of the European Union,\nMr. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, has already had an\nopportunity to state to the Assembly the priorities and\npositions of the European Union. Luxembourg, through\nits commitment on a day-to-day basis, reaffirms its\ndedication to multilateral cooperation and to the work\nof this universal Organization.\nPresident Kavan, you assumed your important\npost through a new procedure designed to revitalize the\nwork of the General Assembly and intensify its impact.\nI am sure that under your guidance we will achieve\nother significant successes.\nMr. Han Seung-soo guided the work of the\nprevious session during a period when the international\nsituation was difficult and beset by serious problems.\nThanks to his extensive experience and his\nunderstanding of international issues, a calm and\nfraternal message of cooperation and concerted action\nresulted from our debates. We all are deeply grateful to\nhim for that.\n4\n\nOur Organization also has the advantage of\nhaving a Secretary-General whose humanism and\noutstanding diplomatic skills are universally\nacknowledged. He has begun his second term with his\ncharacteristic dynamism, which we all admire.\nWe wholeheartedly support the Secretary-General\nin the discharge of his important mission. There is no\ndoubt that multilateralism and the support of the United\nNations system for it have their own particular\ndynamic. We are counting on him to guide the\nOrganization in accordance with the guidelines set out\nin the important statement he made last Thursday.\nRegarding Iraq, we believe that the international\ncommunity must continue to work through the United\nNations, which is charged with the maintenance of\ninternational peace and security. Iraq must provide\nunconditional and unimpeded access to the inspectors\nas well as the necessary cooperation. It must fulfil its\nobligations immediately. We are determined to support\nthe efforts of the United Nations to achieve that goal.\nInternational law was strengthened considerably\nwith the entry into force of the Rome Statute of the\nInternational Criminal Court on 1 July last. This\nrepresents a major step forward in the process of the\npromotion of the rule of law and in the fight against\nimpunity. This young institution must receive our full\nsupport. Indeed, it represents a guarantee in terms of\nthe desire for protection, which is so deeply rooted in\neach of us. The broadest possible ratification of the\nStatute of the Court must remain a high-priority\nobjective of the international community. The\nEuropean Union is actively working to that end to\nensure that the Court is genuinely universal in nature.\nIn the same multilateral context, the\nJohannesburg World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment has just concluded with the observation\nthat our planet's natural reserves and resources are\nlimited and that only solidarity can reconcile the\nlegitimacy of development and the preservation of an\nenvironment that respects life. It is humankind's\nresponsibility to achieve a balance in these two cases.\nThe Summit charted a course through the Plan of\nImplementation, which sets out objectives and\ntimetables. Some may feel that they are not ambitious\nenough, but they certainly can guide us. We need to\nimplement this plan, and here new partnerships\nbetween the United Nations, Governments, companies\nand civil society are an important tool. Governments,\nhowever, still must shoulder all of their\nresponsibilities.\nIn Doha, the World Trade Organization decided to\nlink the opening of markets and technical assistance to\ndevelopment. In Monterrey, a global consensus\nemerged regarding financing for development. In the\nwake of Johannesburg, there is a need now to create\nsynergetic relationships between public assistance,\nsupport from companies, local resources and the\ncommitment of non-governmental organizations.\nPoverty, pollution, overexploitation and, unfortunately,\nviolence, too, will continue for a long time to fuel\npessimism.\nHowever, we are encouraged to note that\ndemocracy and good governance are concepts and\npractices that are moving forward and that are\nincreasingly broadly accepted. In this context, I should\nlike to pay tribute to the young African Union, which\nspecifically included among its objectives the\nadvancement of the principles of democracy and its\ncorollary, the protection of human rights.\nHuman rights, democracy, development and\nsecurity are closely linked. The Council of Europe,\nwhose principal mission is the championing of human\nrights, pluralist democracy and the rule of law, has, like\nthe United Nations, had to face an tremendous\nchallenge following the events of 11 September. Like\nthis universal Organization, the Council of Europe,\nwhose chairmanship Luxembourg has held since\nMay \u2014 its tenure is for a six-month period \u2014 has\ntaken a series of specific measures in the international\ncampaign against terrorism.\nIn addition to advancing the process of the\nsigning and ratification of international instruments,\nthe Council has devised guidelines for an international\ncampaign that includes full respect for human rights.\nIndeed, when security is threatened, respect for human\nrights becomes all the more important. As statesmen, it\nis our obligation to prevent anti-terrorist legislation\nfrom infringing on, or even destroying, democracy in\nits attempt to champion the fundamental values of\nfreedom and to safeguard human rights.\nThe events of 11 September provided a new\nimpetus, as we all are well aware, to cooperation\nbetween institutional partners and, above all,\nemphasized the need to pursue dialogue between\ncultures and religions and to step up the process of\nreflection on civilizations in order to promote tolerance\n5\n\nand universal respect for human rights when we are\nfaced with barbarism. Like the United Nations and the\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\nOrganization, the Council of Europe is committed to\nthat policy.\nCoordination and complementarity between\nregional and international organizations are, moreover,\namong those priorities that Luxembourg has set for its\nchairmanship. It might thus be useful to establish links\nhere with the important centres of the Council\nof Europe, namely the European Court of Human\nRights \u2014 a unique mechanism for the protection of\nhuman rights; the European Commission against\nRacism and Intolerance; and, finally, the Committee for\nthe Prevention of Torture. It is indeed my hope that the\nimportant work on norms and standards carried out by\nthe Committee at the European level will one day be\nimplemented at the international level, and that the\nOptional Protocol to the United Nations Convention\nagainst Torture \u2014 a Protocol that the Assembly will\nsoon be called on to endorse \u2014 will enjoy the same\nsuccess as its European predecessor. The establishment\nof the rule of law for all of us is an objective for which\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary\nRobinson worked tirelessly. She deserves our gratitude\nfor her courage and her contribution to this vital cause.\nHer successor, Mr. Sergio Vieira de Mello, can also\ncount on our full cooperation and support.\nThe special session of the General Assembly on\nthe rights of children in May 2002 allowed us, once\nagain, to condemn that indifference which kills and\ncauses great suffering to millions of disadvantaged and\ndefenceless individuals. While the Convention on the\nRights of the Child has made it possible to specifically\nimprove the lives of countless individuals, work must\nbe stepped up and expanded in order to guarantee that\nthere will be a real difference for generations to come.\nWe view action in favour of women, which falls\nunder the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms\nof Discrimination against Women, in the same context.\nLuxembourg would like to reaffirm its dedication to the\nsignificant work carried out by the United Nations\nfunds and agencies in these areas. In particular I would\nlike to mention the United Nations Children's Fund\n(UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA),\nUnited Nations Development Fund for Women\n(UNIFEM) and the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP). International action for\nreproductive health is at the crux of their programmes\nand today it remains indispensable. It requires firm\nsupport and the necessary budgetary resources. This is\nwhy Luxembourg firmly supports the efforts of\nUNFPA.\nReducing funding for women in difficulty is\ntotally unjust and considerably increases the suffering\nof these individuals. To be sure, the work of those\ndedicated persons who inspire these programmes \u2014\nincluding quite a few non-governmental\norganizations \u2014 will not come to an end any more than\nthe labours of Sisyphus. But, are we not all aware of\nthe progress which has been made possible in the daily\nlife of individuals, groups and peoples, progress made\nthrough institutions which have been carefully\nconceived, democratically established, well managed,\nwhich in addition benefit from the moral authority\nprovided them by the United Nations?\nBearing in mind the destiny of the individuals\nwho are threatened here, international officials must be\nprovided with the means to detect at an early stage any\npossible violation of peace and international security. A\nheightened awareness of our responsibility to provide\nfor the protection of civilian populations is in fact\nnecessary to allow for preventive action and, in\nparticular, for maintaining peace.\nAs has been rightly noted by the Secretary-\nGeneral, such preventive action should be done by\nstrengthening the capacity of operational and structural\nprevention on all levels: local as well as national,\nregional and international, bilateral and multilateral.\nIncreased interaction between all these levels is\nrequired so as to replace a culture of reaction by a\ngenuine culture of prevention. The importance of\ninvesting in conflict prevention strategies, which may\nonly yield fruit much later, is not always obvious. Such\na choice requires a strong will of commitment by all of\nits players.\nFor its part, our universal Organization, through\nthe Security Council and other bodies of the United\nNations system, is dedicated to defining an outline of\npossible international action for prevention to make it\nmore systematic and effective. The pivotal role of the\nUnited Nations and its authority are essential to\nachieve this end. It will be up to the fifty-seventh\nsession of the General Assembly to deal with this\nquestion as well.\nIncreasingly, the need to focus attention on the\ndestinies and tragedies experienced by victims and\n6\n\nreact to the fact that conflicts today deliberately and\nincreasingly claim victims among the civilian\npopulation can be given priority status, because\ninternational relations today are no longer hampered by\nthe ideological battles of yesterday. However,\nantagonisms have not disappeared and may even cloak\nthemselves in new forms. We need to remain vigilant.\nOne year ago, the international community was\ndeeply shaken by the terrorist attacks of 11 September\n2001 against the civilian populations of New York,\nWashington and Pennsylvania. A few days ago we\nvisited Ground Zero as a sign of our grief and to\nreaffirm our determination to act against barbarity.\nWhile we can indeed note that the efforts made since\nthat tragic day to combat international terrorism have\nachieved some specific results, this should not,\nhowever, prompt us to let down our guard. Other\ntragedies are still open wounds, such as the particularly\nobvious case of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nThe Middle East, since Oslo, has seen\nextraordinary efforts at mediation. Faced with violence\nand hate, non-intervention and keeping one's distance\nare not real options. Efforts are continuing, aimed at\ncreating conditions for new negotiations that might\nmake it possible to conclude the work that has been\nlanguishing since Taba. The European Union is\nactively participating in this process and is making\nefforts, through new initiatives of the Danish\npresidency, to once again put the political context at\nthe heart of our concerns. The tireless efforts of the\ninternational community are required to emphasize the\nneed for moderation. Moderates, on whatever side,\nhave no easy task when faced with extremism. But we\nsupport them. Peace requires all of us, in fact, to be\ninternally split, as noted by Mr. Shlomo Ben Ami, but,\nI would add, it will also include reconciliation. And\nthis must be prepared with the new external partner and\nalso with those reluctant domestic forces, which must\nbe reintegrated into the peace process.\nDevelopments in Sri Lanka, moreover,\ndemonstrate that hope can win the day over violence.\nIn the case of Timor-Leste, it is also thanks to the\nUnited Nations that this hope has been fulfilled. And in\nAfrica, several hotbeds of tension have been eased in\n2002, in Angola, in the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo and in Burundi in particular. The effort made by\nthe international community in Afghanistan must, as\nwe know, be continued over time to insure the\nestablishment and functioning of a stable democratic\nand fully representative State. The process of\nnormalization under way in the Balkans deserves\nsimilar attention.\nAfter some 160 years of existence as an\nindependent State, Luxembourg is fully aware of the\nlimits inherent in its size and the means available to it.\nIn foreign policy we are acting with the firm conviction\nthat the multilateral system of cooperation is one which\nprovides a place and a role for everyone. In an\ninterdependent world, we all must shoulder our\nresponsibilities and make our contribution. And that is\nthe basis of our commitment to the universal\nOrganization, as it is the basis of our action to support\ndevelopment in the world. This is why we wish to raise\nour official development assistance to 1 per cent of\nGNP, after having been, in 2001, in the position to go\nbeyond the threshold of 0.7 per cent recommended by\nthe United Nations.\nOur Organization brings together the international\ncommunity. It is the unique forum which allows for\nexchanges and allows us to chart the path for totally\nnew solutions. And I am gratified to see that during\nthis session there are two new Members here in 2002,\nnamely Switzerland and Timor-Leste. We congratulate\nthem on having taken this decision and we extend a\nwarm welcome to them to our Assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffOn behalf of the Government and the people of Saint\nVincent and the Grenadines, I am pleased to offer our\nmost heartfelt congratulations to President Jan Kavan\non his assumption of the office of President of the\nfifty-seventh session of the General Assembly. Let me\nalso express our appreciation and thanks to the\noutgoing President, Mr. Han Seung-soo, for the\nexcellent manner in which he conducted the affairs of\nthe fifty-sixth session as President.\nI should also like to take this opportunity to\nwelcome our newest member \u2014 the Swiss\nConfederation \u2014 into the United Nations, and we look\nforward to the admission of East Timor to the family of\nnations before the end of this month.\nLet me first of all pay my respects to this\nOrganization, the United Nations, and to our Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Kofi Annan. Since the onslaught of the\nterrorist attacks in September last year, the world has\nbeen focused once again on the unique role of the\nUnited Nations as never before, as the nations came\ntogether to fight the scourge of terrorism. Just last\nweek, President Bush used his address to this forum to\ninvoke the special and unique assistance of the United\nNations to deal with the problems related to Iraq. The\nworld breathed a sigh of relief when it heard the\nwelcome decision by Iraq to readmit the United\nNations weapons inspectors, without conditions, into\nIraq. We hope that this decision will be efficacious in\nresolving this problem, which could have unforeseen\nconsequences for the whole world. In general, we\nsupport the collective judgement of the United Nations\nrather than any rash unilateral action by any one or two\nMember States.\nWe have also witnessed the tangible results of the\nsupport of the United Nations for East Timor in its\nstruggle for independence and for Afghanistan in its\nstruggle for liberation, peace and stability.\nI say without hesitation or equivocation that\ntoday the world needs the United Nations more than\never before.\nHolding the attention of all of us at this time are\nongoing activities associated with the war on terrorism.\nWe were all engaged in a solemn commemoration of\nthe sickening events of 11 September just last week, on\nthe occasion of the first anniversary of the brutal\nterrorist attacks on the United States of America.\nWe \u2014 the whole world \u2014 must commit ourselves to\nensuring that such events will never happen again. We\napplaud the work done by the Counter-Terrorism\nCommittee established by the United Nations to secure\ncompliance with Security Council resolution 1373\n(2001).\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines has already\ncontributed to this effort by implementing a range of\nmeasures to combat terrorism and assist the global\neffort. We recognize the links between terrorism and\ninternational criminal activities such as drug\ntrafficking, money-laundering and organized crime. We\npledge to do whatever is in our power to combat these\nthreats.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, like many of\nthe poorer nations of the world, is crippled by external\ndebt. The burden of this debt means that areas of\ncritical importance to our development, such as\neducation, poverty reduction and social development,\nare deprived of the resources that are desperately\nneeded for the advancement of our people.\nThe pursuit of sustainable development remains\ncentral to the efforts of our people to create a better life\nfor themselves. To this end, my country had great\nexpectations from the International Conference on\nFinancing for Development, held in Monterrey,\nMexico, and also from the just-concluded World\nSummit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg,\nSouth Africa. While these conferences enabled some\nattention to be focused on the urgency of the\ndevelopment agenda that must be addressed, and some\nlevel of consensus was achieved with respect to the\naction required, we must lament the reluctance of some\ndeveloped countries to give more meaningful\nexpression to their stated commitments.\nMere recognition and articulation of the problems\nwill not suffice. Actions, not words, are needed to\nchange the situation. This requires the will and the\nrequisite resources to effect the changes required. We\ntherefore call on those members of the international\ncommunity to give reality to their words by putting in\nplace the necessary arrangements and the financing\nthrough which we all can manage the critical problems\nof sustainable development. Let us remind the\ninternational community of its commitment to meeting\n5\n\nthe United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross\ndomestic product for official development assistance.\nMy country, like others in the Caribbean and in\nAfrica, is threatened by the scourge of HIV/AIDS. As a\nmatter of fact, my country has the second-highest per\ncapita ratio of HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean Community\n(CARICOM). We are in danger of losing a whole\ngeneration of our young people to this dreaded disease.\nWe lack the resources to procure the necessary\ntreatment and proper care for those affected. We must\nall work together \u2014 developed and developing\ncountries \u2014 to eradicate this and other diseases such as\nmalaria and tuberculosis. We must make sure that the\nGlobal Fund to fight these diseases has the necessary\nresources to do its work effectively.\nSix years after the completion of the Uruguay\nRound of trade negotiations and the creation of the\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO), my country has had\nto endure the ravages of the imbalances of economic\npower in the world. The constraints imposed by our\nsmall size and vulnerability must now be evident to all.\nAs we deploy our limited human resources to engage in\nnegotiations at three distinct and separate levels \u2014 the\nWTO, the European Union and the Free Trade Area of\nthe Americas \u2014 we urge that due recognition be given\nto the need for flexibility in trading arrangements for\ncountries such as mine. We would also like to see a\nrealistic assessment of special and differential\ntreatment in the continued architecture of the global\ntrading and economic arrangements. Our ability to\nsurvive is effectively compromised if there is no\nflexibility in these negotiations.\nWe welcome the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment. We commend the African countries that\ncame together to create this bold and imaginative new\ninitiative. Africa needs the help of the United Nations\nand in particular that of the donor countries. But Africa\nalso needs to help itself by committing itself to peace,\ndemocracy and good governance, which requires the\neradication of corruption in public life. We welcome\nthe efforts being made to end strife and war and to\ncreate a climate of stability and peace in Angola, Sierra\nLeone, the Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo.\nAs we view the international scene, we are\ntroubled by the widespread and corrosive nature of\ncorruption in public life in many countries. The effects\nin the developing countries are more debilitating.\nCorruption distorts the economies of those countries,\nsince, in effect, resources are taken from the poor and\ngiven to the rich. My country, as part of its war against\ncorruption in public life, has recently ratified the\nOrganization of American States (OAS) Convention\nagainst Corruption, which requires, among other\nthings, the criminalizing of illicit enrichment by public\nofficials and integrity legislation requiring a\ndeclaration of assets by certain public officials. I\nhumbly suggest that the United Nations recognize the\npervasiveness of corruption in public life and its\nconsequent damages and take steps to approve and\npromote a United Nations anti-corruption convention.\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines has a very special\nand beneficial relationship with the Republic of China\non Taiwan, which we value. It represents a test of\nfriendship, loyalty, reciprocity and shared values in our\nrelationship. The Republic of China on Taiwan, the\n17th largest economy in the world, is a country of 23\nmillion people that has made tremendous strides within\na few years to become one of the most economically\nadvanced countries in the Far East. It is a country that\npractices and promotes human rights. It has a\nGovernment that is democratically elected by the free\nand unfettered expression of its citizens.\nWe strongly support Taiwan's rights to be a\nMember of this body of nations. We cannot understand\nhow the exclusion of Taiwan, which is a peace-loving,\nresponsible, democratic and progressive country, can\nsit comfortably on the collective conscience of the\nMember States of the United Nations. The United\nNations has a role to play in relations between Taiwan\nand the People's Republic of China. The United\nNations should play a facilitating role by providing a\nforum for reconciliation and rapprochement between\nthe two sides. But \u2014 and I cannot stress this point too\nstrongly \u2014 the United Nations cannot play such a role\nif it continues to exclude Taiwan. We shall continue to\nsupport the legitimate aspirations of the 23 million\npeople of Taiwan, who remain voiceless in this\nAssembly, to membership in this body and its agencies,\nin accordance with the United Nations principle of\nuniversality.\nThe Government and people of Saint Vincent and\nthe Grenadines also share friendship with the people\nand Government of Cuba. We support the worldwide\ncall, as expressed in United Nations resolutions, for\nending the economic, commercial and financial\nembargo imposed by the United States against Cuba\n6\n\nsome 42 years ago. Indeed, such a call has been made\nby the Congress of the United States so as to facilitate\nthe freedom of movement of United States citizens to\nCuba.\nWe uphold the right of peoples to self-\ndetermination \u2014 a principle very dear to our people\nand Government. It is highly improper and\nunacceptable to the vast majority of the nations of the\nworld that one country impose such suffering on\nanother without any justifiable reason. We call on the\nUnited States to heed the voices of its citizens, the\nCongress and the rest of the world and to engage Cuba\nin a meaningful dialogue for the mutual benefit of both\ncountries.\nOver the past year, we have watched with\ngrowing concern the escalation of tension and violence\nin the Middle East. We are sensitive to the fact that\nefforts against international terrorism have made the\nlessening of tensions and the resolution of the problems\nin the Middle East all the more difficult. We support\nthe plan for two States \u2014 Israel and Palestine \u2014 living\nas neighbours within secure borders that are recognized\nby each other and the international community. Once\nagain, we call on both sides to abide by the various\nSecurity Council resolutions on the dispute. We support\nthe efforts of the Quartet and call upon them to\ncontinue their peace-making efforts with urgency. They\nhave our unqualified backing. In the meantime, we\nurge restraint and the use of common sense in the\nsearch for a full solution to the problem. We remind all\nsides that the greatest use of power is restraint in the\nuse of that power. We urge the world community to\nmake sure that all resolutions of the United Nations are\nenforced fairly, even-handedly and with equity on all\nStates in conflict in the area and to avoid the\nappearance of selective, capricious or arbitrary\nenforcements where it suits the interests of some\nStates.\nIn South Asia, we trust that there will be a de-\nescalation of tensions in the Kashmiri conflict. The\nrisks and the perils would be too great for the whole\nworld if the two major countries involved in that\nconflict engage in an all-out war, resorting to nuclear\nweapons.\nWe place our support behind every effort to\nrevitalize the work of the General Assembly so that its\ncollective energy and wisdom can again be brought to\nbear with great weight to resolve the gravest tensions\nimpacting the world community. The General\nAssembly needs to be more dynamic in order to reflect\nthe will of all its Member States. We also support the\nneed for a reform of the Security Council to give\ncognizance to the world situation as it exists today and\nnot as was the norm after the Second World War. We\nfully support the call for an increase in the membership\nof the Security Council and would work for the more\nmeaningful participation of developing countries in the\nSecurity Council to reflect the universal nature of the\nUnited Nations.\nMy country is a small island developing State. As\nsuch, we are extremely vulnerable to physical and\neconomic shocks. We are pleased with the recognition\ngiven to the unique problems of small island\ndeveloping States in the outcome of the World Summit\non Sustainable Development, and we look forward to\nreal progress in the implementation of the Barbados\nProgramme of Action, leading up to the conference in\nMauritius in 2004. We continue to face the threat to our\nregion and our oceans by the passage of hazardous\nnuclear waste through our waters. The world\ncommunity must understand just how fragile our\necosystems are. We must reduce the risk by ending that\npractice, and thus we call on the guilty parties to\nrespect the Caribbean Sea as a special zone for\neconomic development within the context of\nsustainable development.\nI have taken this opportunity to focus our efforts\ntowards increasing sensitivity in the international\ncommunity to the concerns of our small island\ndeveloping State. Our perspective is informed by our\nhistory and our experiences. Many are the challenges\nthat confront us in a world of globalization and trade\nliberalization. We make our special plea for special\nconsideration, without which we could become totally\nmarginalized. The aspirations of our people are the\nsame as those of other lands. We desire peace, stability,\ndemocracy, respect for human lives and economic and\nsocial uplifting. We intend to work hard to achieve\nthose goals. Our people have come through slavery,\nindentureship, colonialism and imperialism, and we\nhave survived. With the support and goodwill of the\ndonor countries, with our hard work and with the help\nof the Almighty, we intend to succeed.\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "\ufeffI would like to congratulate\nMr. Jan Kavan on his assumption of the presidency of\nthe General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session. I am\nconfident that his leadership will successfully carry us\nthrough this session. We extend to his predecessor,\nMr. Han Seung-soo, our sincere appreciation for the\nexcellent manner in which he steered the work of the\nrecently concluded fifty-sixth session of the General\nAssembly.\nMy delegation warmly welcomes Switzerland as\na new Member of this family of nations. I would be\nremiss if I did not pay tribute to the United Nations for\nits role in ensuring the smooth transition of East Timor\nto statehood. We believe that the new nation will for\nsome time continue to require the support of the\ninternational community in its efforts at nation-\nbuilding. We look forward to welcoming East Timor\ninto the United Nations in the near future.\nYesterday, the United States and, indeed, the\nwhole world, commemorated the first anniversary of\nthe horrific terrorist attacks on New York and\nWashington. Terrorism is a threat to international peace\nand security. No matter where it occurs, no matter\nwhom it is directed at and no matter what form it takes,\nthe scourge of terrorism must be condemned and dealt\nwith decisively and in conformity with the ideals and\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter. The adoption\nof unilateral measures by some countries to combat\nterrorism not only is counterproductive but also\nundermines the mandate and effectiveness of the\nUnited Nations. In dealing with this scourge, the world\ncommunity needs to focus on identifying and\naddressing its root causes, such as poverty, the denial\nof fundamental freedoms and the absence of social\njustice.\nThe United Nations is confronted with a volatile\nsituation in the Middle East that has the potential to\nengulf the entire subregion. The Palestinian question\nshould be resolved without further delay, as it is\ncausing untold suffering to the people in the occupied\n25\n\nterritories. Israel must withdraw its forces from\nPalestinian lands, and the Palestinians must be afforded\nthe opportunity of having a State of their own. The\ncarnage that is going on at present will benefit neither\nside. Israel must know that its chances for peace and\nsecurity lie in having a Palestinian State that will live\nside by side with it in mutual respect between\nsovereign States.\nWe believe that Palestinians should be left alone\nto elect the leaders of their choice, as it is their\ndemocratic and sovereign right to do. It is only leaders\nthus elected who can ensure peace and stability within\nthe State of Palestine and between Palestine and all of\nits neighbours. We note with concern that some\ncountries wish to arrogate to themselves the right to\nchoose or impose leadership in developing countries by\nsidelining or overthrowing democratically elected\nGovernments. Not only is this a negation of democracy\nand democratic principles, but it constitutes outright\ninterference in the internal affairs of independent\nsovereign States, and must be resisted. I say this in\nrelation not only to other States but also to my own\ncountry. My people elected me, and that election was\nheld to have been valid by Africa and its organizations.\nBut Europe said, \u201cNo\u201d \u2014 and it was Europe that\nyesterday was our oppressor and colonialist. Europe\nsaid \u201cNo\u201d, but Africa said, \u201cYes\u201d. To whom do we\nlisten? The whites in Europe or the blacks in Africa?\nWe listen to our own blacks and their judgement; they\nare our people. They, and no one else, are the ones who\nshould elect us.\nZimbabwe welcomes the emergence of peace in\nAngola \u2014 a fellow member of the Southern African\nDevelopment Community \u2014 and urges both sides to\nthe conflict to remain committed to the Memorandum\nof Understanding signed earlier this year. The\ninternational community should urgently assist that\ncountry in consolidating the peace, and move on with\nthe reconstruction and rehabilitation process. This is a\nsmall price to pay in order to give the people of Angola\nthe peace that has eluded them since the 1950s.\nWe are also pleased that the peace process in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo is moving in the\nright direction. We would like to recognize the efforts\nof the Government of South Africa and the United\nNations in this regard and to call on the United Nations\nto take strong measures against those who violate the\nagreed ceasefire.\nLet me take this opportunity to announce once\nagain that, in view of these positive developments,\nZimbabwe is in the process of withdrawing its\nremaining forces from the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo. We hope, however, that the Security Council\nwill act boldly and without favour in ensuring that\npeace is consolidated in the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo and that it will immediately proceed with\nthe full deployment of the third phase of the United\nNations Organization Mission in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo.\nIn the same vein, we note that the mandate of the\nExpert Panel on the Illegal Exploitation of Natural\nResources and Other Forms of Wealth in the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo expires in\nDecember 2002. It is our fervent hope that this time the\nPanel will have the courage to fully expose the\neconomic agenda of the countries that invaded the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\nWe are gathered here to chart the way forward\ntowards the creation of a world fit for all of us, to the\nturn of the century and beyond. We are meeting against\nthe backdrop of the crucial summits that were held this\nyear, during which landmark decisions were made\nregarding sustainable global economic and social\ndevelopment. Among these were the Monterrey\nInternational Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment, and the recently concluded World\nSummit on Sustainable Development, held in\nJohannesburg, South Africa. It is our hope that the\ndecisions of these conferences will be translated into\nmeaningful cooperation among development partners.\nIn this context, we welcome the pledges made for\nincreased development aid and the commitment to\nsustainable development, which are essential for future\ngenerations.\nUnfortunately, the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment demonstrated beyond doubt the\nunwillingness on the part of some developed countries\nto commit themselves more meaningfully to these\ninternational undertakings. They preferred instead to\nhide behind hackneyed and spurious conditionalities\nwhich all but oppose and negate the practice of\ndemocracy, good governance and respect for human\nrights in the developing world. While we all cherish\nthese values, we are dismayed that they are\nincreasingly being used by developed countries that\nhave checkered democratic credentials and poor human\nrights records in order to settle political scores and to\n26\n\nforestall the economic development of countries whose\nGovernments they do not like. When we see these same\ncountries propping up regimes that are blatantly\nundemocratic, we cannot but conclude that this wilful\ncommingling of issues is just an excuse for doing\nnothing about legitimate demands that the development\naspirations of developing countries be addressed. The\nUnited Nations General Assembly should express its\ndeep dismay at such dishonest attempts on the part of\nthose countries and call upon them to stop the abuse of\ninternational agreements and shared values and the\nimposition of their interests upon other, often smaller\nnations.\nWe call for improved global governance through\nthe democratization of multilateral organizations, such\nas the United Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions\nand the World Trade Organization. There is also need\nfor coherence in global policy-making. In the same\nvein, the management of the globalization process\nshould not be left to market forces alone but should be\nregulated in a way that gives it a humane face and\nreverses the marginalization of developing countries.\nIn the area of world trade, we call for a level\nplaying field in agenda setting and rule making in the\nWorld Trade Organization. We also need to see greater\nmarket-access opportunities for goods of export\ninterest to developing countries in developed country\nmarkets, as well as greater willingness to address\nissues of commodity pricing. In addition, we call for\nthe removal of agricultural subsidies, which have\ndepressed the competitiveness of products from\ndeveloping countries and inhibited their entry into the\nlucrative markets of the North. In the same vein, my\ndelegation also calls for the immediate cancellation of\nthe debt of poor countries, so that debt-service funds,\nwhich are crippling the development efforts of\ndeveloping nations, can be used to improve the\nsituation of those countries.\nThe special session on children, which was held\nhere in New York in May of this year, did much to\nbring to the fore the need to address, in a meaningful\nway, the rights and development needs of children,\nwith a view to enabling them to play their respective\nroles in society. The United Nations should continue to\narticulate those needs and foster the creation of a world\nfit for children.\nSince the attainment of independence in 1980,\nZimbabwe has made tremendous progress in the\nprovision of schools and health-care facilities to\nimprove the quality of life of its children. Regrettably,\nthese gains were later to be reversed, as the Bretton\nWoods institutions demanded that we deprioritize\neducation, health and social welfare in our resource\nallocations. Even without the support of those\ninstitutions, we have continued, within our limited\nmeans, to place primary importance on the\ndevelopment of the Zimbabwean child and the welfare\nof the underprivileged, thereby raising the literacy rate\nin our society to 87 per cent.\nZimbabwe and other countries in Southern Africa\nare grappling with the effects of the HIV/AIDS\npandemic. Our own efforts at combating the scourge\nare not enough, and they need to be augmented by the\npositive contribution of those countries that have the\nrequisite financial resources and technological know-\nhow.\nWe continue to call on the international\ncommunity and private companies to hasten their\nefforts at finding an answer to this pandemic, which is\nravaging our populations and economies. Affordable\nbut effective drugs need to be made available, while\nsupport should be given to care givers helping those\nwho suffer from the disease. Special assistance should\nbe given to the growing number of children orphaned\nby the pandemic. We hope that the fund set up at last\nyear's General Assembly special session on HIV/AIDS\nwill receive the urgent and meaningful support that it\ndeserves.\nAs you are aware, my country and most parts of\nSouthern Africa, are currently experiencing a\nhumanitarian crisis as a result of the drought that hit\nduring the main cereal-producing season earlier this\nyear. We commend the efforts being made by\ninternational organizations and the donor community to\nprovide urgent food and non-food aid to our\ncommunities. We particularly wish to mention the\nefforts of United Nations agencies in this regard. We\nalso welcome additional assistance in programmes that\nwill mitigate the effects of future droughts.\nFinally, my delegation is happy to inform you that\nZimbabwe has concluded the fast-track land-\nredistribution programme that we introduced in July\n2000 in order to transfer land to the hitherto landless\nblack majority. It will be recalled that we had to face\nvehement protestations, bad publicity and\nmisinformation from those who did not wish us well.\n27\n\nWe remained resolute in the face of powerful forces\ndetermined to preserve vestiges of colonial privilege.\nThe primary objective of our agrarian reforms has\nbeen to redress the colonial injustice perpetrated by\nBritain, whereby a minority of British settlers in 1890\nseized our land and acquired our natural resources but\nnever paid any compensation to our ancestors.\nBy assuming its independence in 1980,\nZimbabwe discarded the colonial yoke for all time and,\ntherefore, will never brook any interference in its\ndomestic affairs by any foreign Power. I appeal to this\nGeneral Assembly to convey to Britain and especially\nto its current Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, that\nZimbabwe ceased to be a British colony in 1980 after\nPrince Charles, on behalf of the Government of the\nUnited Kingdom, gracefully lowered the British flag,\ncalled the \u201cUnion Jack\u201d. He should also be informed\nthat the people of Zimbabwe waged an armed\nrevolutionary struggle for their independence and stand\nready to defend it in the same way. We want to be left\nin peace to carry out our just reforms and development\nplans, as we peacefully interact and cooperate with\nother countries within the region, the African continent\nand the international community. We refuse to be an\nextension of Europe. We are Africans and shall remain\nso forever. I wish the 57th session of the General\nAssembly every success.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

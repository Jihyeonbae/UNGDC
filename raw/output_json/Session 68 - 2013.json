        "file_text": "It is my honour to convey to \nthe Assembly the warm greeting of \u201cYokwe\u201d from the \nGovernment and people of the Republic of the Marshall \nIslands.\n\nEvery September, world leaders take to the stage \nof the General Assembly to broadcast our common \nconcerns. But I am concerned that this poetic ritual too \noften hides the problem of political will. In January, the \nSecretary-General outlined two key political priorities \nfor leaders: addressing climate change risks and the \n\n\n\f\ngrowing insecurity within Syria. As autumn sets in, it \nis evident that efforts are falling short. \n\nThis year, leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum \nexpressed strong concern about the use of chemical \nweapons by the Syrian Government and called for \nleadership on the part of the members of the Security \nCouncil to resolve that threat. While I am optimistic \nabout recent diplomatic developments, the common \ninternational voice may come too little and too late for \nwhat could have already been prevented. That is only \none example of a growing list of the tragic human costs \nof inaction. How many more mistakes will the world \nmake in distant conference rooms? For how long can we \nturn a blind eye to realities and headlines?\n\nPacific nations are now dedicated to changing \nthe pace. This month, Pacific Islands Forum leaders \nadopted the Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership. \nAlthough many of our States are small, the common \nresponsibility to act falls on all Governments and \npersons, no matter how different we are. \n\nThe Marshall Islands is well on track to achieve \nthe complete solarization of our outer islands \u2014 a goal \nwe are meeting with assistance from Japan\u2019s Pacific \nEnvironment Community funds and from the European \nUnion, Taiwan, Italy, France and other donor partners. \nThe entire region is also aggressively cutting its \nemissions through the Pacific New Energy Drive. The \nmessage to our partners, the world\u2019s largest emitters, is \nclear. If we can do it, they can too. Climate change is \na risk that demands direct political ownership, and it is \nhigh time that other leaders stand alongside the Pacific \nin showing the statesmanship so urgently needed. \nSimply repeating well-worn negotiation slogans has not \ngot the world anywhere. It is time for new solutions. I \nstrongly urge my fellow leaders to engage eye to eye \nat the Secretary-General\u2019s climate summit next year. \nNever has the need for true statesmanship been as dire.\n\nGlobal efforts on climate change are falling short, \nand low-lying island nations, such as mine, are already \npaying the earliest costs of what is fast becoming a \nglobal crisis. In every sense, the world must build for \nfuture risks, and we are still setting course based on \ncurrent conditions, as is often the case. It is the seas \nthat are rising \u2014 not the islands that are sinking. I will \nnot concede my own land or my nation; nor will I rest \nuntil my fellow world leaders have signed on to act, not \njust out of economic convenience, but out of a common \nresponsibility of all to strive for upward momentum.\n\nOur Pacific legacy is not as small island States, \nbut as large ocean nations. We are stewards of what \nis a truly global resource \u2014 our oceans and fisheries. \nEven a casual glance at a map reveals a world of deep \nand vast blue, and not only scientists but our own local \ncommunities see change in our waters. Local and global \nocean impacts affect not only every region, but also \nglobal food security. I join with other Pacific leaders in \nurging dedicated treatment of the oceans as a post-2015 \nUnited Nations sustainable development goal.\n\nPacific nations, including the States parties to the \nNauru Agreement, are leading the world in changing \nfishing practice. We are not only leading the world in \nadvancing sustainable fisheries, but at the same time \nboosting our own economic growth. Perhaps no other \neffort or region is such a strong textbook example of \nsustainable development in action. But for all of the \nexpressed plenary sympathies and common international \nresponsibility, existing legal commitments to safeguard \nfisheries all too often fall victim to the short-term \ntrade interests of our partners. We Pacific leaders \nwill sacrifice neither our resources nor our growth or \nlivelihood for quick returns; our future generations are \nnot for sale. The threat of harmful fisheries sanctions \nfrom distant fishing nations \u2014 perhaps as punishment \nfor our conservation efforts \u2014 is hardly a helping hand \neither to our regional development or to international \nfood security.\n\nNext year\u2019s international meeting on small island \nStates and development partnerships, to be held in \nSamoa, will offer our political partners a moment for \ncareful reflection. Is the global thirst for rare earth \nminerals beneath our waves and is the hunger for \nour vast fisheries so great as to outstrip our rightful \neconomic development and our conservation efforts? \nPerhaps it is high time that island leaders set forward \nour island vision of partnership and collaborate \naccordingly. We cannot forge progress through political \nwill alone. Here, Pacific Islands Forum leaders have \nforged a ground-breaking mutual dialogue to enhance \nand improve effective United Nations partnerships in \nour region. Those are not isolated words; already, the \nUnited Nations, together with our bilateral partners, is \nplaying a valuable role in working with the Marshall \nIslands to recover from a climate-driven drought and \nother coastal flooding emergencies.\n\nBut we need not wait for disasters. In every sector \nof basic development and environmental efforts, our \ndoor is open for increased collaboration among the \n\n\n\f\nUnited Nations, our regional resources and bilateral \npartners. The statements of sympathy in the plenary are \nall too often not translated into effective, island-tailored \nresults. Our in-country United Nations presence still \nhas a long way to go in truly delivering as one and \nbetter addressing pressing threats. I encourage a direct \ndiscussion between the United Nations and our region \non practical efforts to enhance in-country effectiveness \nand collaboration. No one people or nation should be \npassed over.\n\nEven as the United Nations enters into a new \ndiscussion in setting the stage for the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda, improved progress towards the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) remains \nno less a priority. I would also like to recognize the \ncontributions that Taiwan has made in helping my \ncountry in efforts to achieve the MDGs.\n\nPacific Islands Forum leaders have, for the first \ntime, recognized the role of the United Nations in \nauthorizing nuclear-weapon testing during the Cold \nWar and welcomed the recommendations of the \nUnited Nations Special Rapporteur\u2019s recent report \n(A/HRC/21/48/Add.1). Nuclear testing in the Marshall \nIslands is no mere historical event, but an international \nlegacy that will stay with us for generations. While the \nbulk of the unmet responsibilities still rest with our \nhistorical Administering Power, the United States, the \nUnited Nations can, for its part, no longer ignore its \nown role during the Trusteeship era. \n\nI am strongly encouraged by the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s commitment to addressing the ongoing \nimpacts of nuclear testing in the Pacific and look \nforward to practical steps in that regard.\n\nMy Government is gratified to note \nthat \u2014 with solid international support and cross-\nstrait cooperation \u2014 the Republic of China on Taiwan \nhas increased its meaningful participation in United \nNations specialized agencies and mechanisms. We will \ncontinue to encourage positive interaction between the \ntwo sides of the Taiwan Strait in the international arena.\n\nToo often, despite our own aspirations, we struggle \nto move inches when urgency demands miles. We wish \nto inform the Secretary-General that our political will \nstands ready and that our hands are extended for a \ndurable partnership.\n"

        "file_text": "As we gather near Ground \nZero, site of the World Trade Center mass murder, I \nwish first to honour the victims of terrorism. I honour \nall victims everywhere, including those killed and \nwounded at the Westgate Shopping Mall in Nairobi.\n\nTragically, we lost two Canadians in Nairobi, including \none of our diplomats. There is no more fitting venue to \nhonour the life of Annemarie Desloges and her service \nthan right here at the United Nations. The crime of \nterror is an assault on all people. In its wake, the human \nfamily is one \u2014 united in pain, mourning and our \nresolve that we will never allow evil to triumph.\n\nAt this moment of grief, the oneness of humankind is \nthe theme of my remarks today.\nAllow me to begin with an observation drawn from \nthe Canadian experience. The province of Newfoundland \nand Labrador was the last province to join Canada, but \nit is the site of the earliest known European settlement \nin the New World. L\u2019Anse aux Meadows is more than \n1,000 years old. We consider the province\u2019s capital city, \nSt. John\u2019s, to be the oldest English settlement in North \nAmerica, dating back to 1497.\n\nThe early Newfoundland settlements are the \nsubject of significant archeological activity. Among the \nartifacts commonly found is a three-handled drinking \nmug known as a tyg. The three handles are designed \nfor sharing. During the seventeenth century, it was \ncommon to share eating and drinking utensils. Further \nresearch reveals that the tyg is not unique to Canadian \nand English history. On the contrary, cups with three \nor more handles are common to many of the world\u2019s \ncultures. Indeed, nearly three millennia ago, Homer \nwrote in the Iliad of a multi-handled mug. The tyg and \nits many counterparts around the world are tangible \nreminders not just of the fact that eating and drinking are \nsocial activities, but that, as long as human beings have \ninhabited this planet, sustenance and the necessaries of \nlife have been community endeavours. Human beings \nshare out of necessity. We cooperate to survive. We \nform communities because that is our natural state. As \nCicero observed, we were born to unite with our fellow \nmen and to join in community with the human race.\n\nAnimated by the same spirit of community, the \nCharter of the United Nations declares that our goals \ninclude to live together, to be neighbours and to unite. \nThe very first words of the Charter of the United \nNations make clear that the Organization is a body of, \nby and for human beings. It begins, \u201cWe the peoples \nof the United Nations\u201d \u2014 not \u201cWe the countries\u201d or \n\n\u201cWe the Governments\u201d or \u201cWe the political leaders\u201d, \nbut \u201cWe the peoples\u201d. That is an important reminder of \nwhy and on whose behalf we are all here today.\n\nAt the United Nations, Canada targets its efforts \non securing tangible results for the human family. It \nis much more important to consider what the United \nNations is achieving than how the United Nations \narranges its affairs. Canada\u2019s Government does not \nseek to have our values or our principled foreign policy \nvalidated by elites who would rather go along to get \nalong. The billions who are hungry, or lack access to \nclean water, or are displaced, or cannot read and write \ndo not care how many members sit on the Security \nCouncil. But they do need to know that their brothers \nand sisters in humankind will walk with them through \nthe darkness.\n\nPeace, prosperity and freedom are the conditions \nthat have been sought by human communities from the \nbeginning of recorded time: to live in peace, to live in \nprosperity, to live in freedom.\n\nOf those priorities peace is the foremost objective of \nthe United Nations. It is no surprise that the Charter \nof the United Nations mentions the word peace four \ndozen times. Sadly, peace the word is easier to locate \nthan peace the condition. Since the moment the \nOrganization was created, not a day has passed without \nthe human family being pained by war somewhere on \nthe planet. Almost always, the suffering is felt by the \nmost vulnerable among us. Far too often, that involves \nwomen and violence.\nIn the context of war, rape and serious sexual \nviolence are war crimes. I have met girls who were \nvictims of that very war crime, and their stories are \nabsolutely horrific. The war criminals involved must be \nidentified, pursued, prosecuted and punished. Earlier \nthis year, Canada and other Group of Eight nations \nagreed to treat sexual violence in conflict as a violation \nof the Geneva Conventions. I applaud the United \nKingdom and Foreign Secretary William Hague for \ntheir work in this very important area. But he would be \nthe first to acknowledge that the fight to eradicate this \ncrime has been led by women, including the Special \nRepresentative of the Secretary-General on Sexual \nViolence in Conflict, Ms. Zainab Hawa Bangura.\n\nTragically every year, millions of girls, some \nas young as nine years old, are forced into marriage. \nSince I began my remarks today, 100 children have \nbeen forced into marriage at a rate of 1,100 per hour, or \nmore than 26,000 per day. The effects of early forced \nmarriage are documented and beyond dispute. Early \nforced marriage harms health, halts education, destroys \nopportunity and enslaves women in a life of poverty. A \nyoung woman once recounted her wedding date. She \nremembered, \u201cIt was the day I left school\u201d. No country \nis immune from this scourge.\n\nThis is a global problem \u2014 a problem for humankind. \nForced marriage is rape \u2014 an act of violence against \nwomen. Early forced marriage is child rape \u2014 an act of \nviolence against young girls. The practice is abhorrent \nand indefensible. We condemn it, even though some \nmight prefer that we kept quiet. The discomfort of the \npublic is of small concern, particularly in the context of \na crime that calls to heaven for justice.\n(spoke in English)\nIf the United Nations does not act to protect young \ngirls, who will?\nAnother way to protect the vulnerable is to improve \nthe health of mothers, newborns and children so that \nwe can reduce the number of deaths. I would like to say \nhow proud I am of Canadian Prime Minister Stephen \nHarper for having led a global effort \u2014 the Muskoka \nInitiative \u2014 to reduce maternal and infant mortality \nand to improve the health of mothers and children in \nthe world\u2019s poorest countries. That is about half of the \nworld\u2019s population, and all of its potential.\n\nWhile those efforts, to eradicate sexual violence \nin conflict, to eliminate early forced marriage and to \nimprove maternal and newborn health are essential, \nwe must do more than react to crises. We must invest \nin opportunities for women and young girls. We must \nensure that women participate fully in all parts of our \nsociety and in all the countries of the United Nations. \nThat will help us build a stronger, more secure, more \nprosperous and more peaceful world. It is in every \nnation\u2019s self-interest to ensure every young girl realizes \nher full potential. And it is from the perspective of the \nhuman family, one family, that we must address other \nthreats to peace and security.\n\nAmong the most urgent crises remains the violence \nin Syria. Canada\u2019s position is clear: we support the \n\n\n\f\nSyrian people, the innocent people caught up in this \nsenseless violence and those who show great courage in \nworking on their behalf. We will never support a brutal \nand illegitimate regime that has unleashed weapons of \nmass destruction on its own people. Nor will we tolerate \nextremism and terrorism as alternatives to Al-Assad\u2019s \ntyranny.\n\nThe people of Canada have been generous in \nhelping those most in need. When success is achieved, \nI believe that it is important to recognize it. The near-\nimpossible work of the World Food Programme must \nbe applauded, and Canada has responded by being the \nsecond-largest single-country donor in the world. Its \nwork in Syria is paramount and has not gone unnoticed. \nI also commend the work of the Office of the United \nNations High Commissioner for Refugees in providing \nassistance to the refugees fleeing that terrible conflict, \nas well as the generosity of Syria\u2019s neighbours in \nproviding safe haven.\n\nCanada joins the entire world in seeking a political \nresolution to the conflict. Canada supports a peaceful, \ndemocratic and pluralistic Syria that protects the rights \nof all communities. But let us not confuse a peaceful, \nnegotiated outcome with equivocation or moral \nuncertainty. There can be no moral ambiguity about the \nuse of chemical weapons, particularly against civilians.\n\nToday, 30 September, is a dark reminder of the \nprice of accommodation with evil. It is the seventy-\nfifth anniversary of the Munich Agreement, by which \nCzechoslovakia\u2019s freedom was sacrificed to appease \nthe Nazi regime. The appeasers claimed they had won \npeace in our time. In fact, their abandoning of principle \nwas a calamity for the world. Nobel Peace Prize winner \nElie Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor who was imprisoned \nat Auschwitz, has been even blunter:\n\n\u201cNeutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. \nSilence encourages the tormentor, never the \ntormented. Sometimes we must interfere. When \nhuman lives are endangered, when human dignity \nis in jeopardy, national borders and sensitivities \nbecome irrelevant.\u201d\nJust as we are not neutral or silent on the crimes \nbeing committed against the Syrian people, neither is \nCanada neutral on Israel\u2019s right to exist and to defend \nitself. There can be no bargaining over Israel\u2019s existence. \nWhile dialogue is a virtue, there can be no virtuous \ndiscussion with anyone wedded to Israel\u2019s destruction. \nToday, the Jewish people are masters of their own fate, \nlike most other nations, in their sovereign Jewish State. \nAnd like all other nations, Israel has the right to defend \nitself, by itself.\n\nCanada fundamentally believes peace is achievable \nand that Palestinians and Israelis and their neighbours \ncan live side by side in peace and security. We, like \nmany nations, wish to see a prosperous Palestinian State \nliving in peace with its Jewish neighbour. That is why, \nalthough at times we have fundamental differences \non how statehood is achieved, Canada is providing \nsignificant assistance to build the institutions that are \nvital to the establishment of a viable future State. In the \nWest Bank, Canada is contributing greatly to economic, \nsecurity and justice initiatives.\n\nRecent developments in negotiations between Israel \nand the Palestinian Authority are indeed encouraging. \nI want to salute the leadership and courage of the \nIsraeli Prime Minister and the Palestinian Authority\u2019s \nPresident. I commend United States Secretary of State \nJohn Kerry for his personal leadership in this area. We \nmust all commit ourselves to this cause, united by the \nprospect of peace.\n\nI look forward to the day when Israeli and \nPalestinian children can live side by side in peace and \nsecurity in a Jewish and in a Palestinian State.\n\nDialogue is important, yes. But our dialogue must \nbe a prelude to action, and action must mean achieving \nresults. Action must mean making a difference. If we \ntake the recent statements coming from the regime in \nIran, some observers see encouraging signs, but sound \nbites do not remove threats to global security. Kind \nwords, a smile and a charm offensive are not a substitute \nfor real action. We will welcome and acknowledge \nreform, if and when it comes. By the following test \nwe will know when genuine reform has occurred: has \nthere been real, measurable, material improvement in \nthe lives of the Iranian people and in the security of the \nworld? Not yet. We will judge the regime on the basis \nof its actions and results.\n\nThe five permanent members of the Security \nCouncil plus Germany have had five rounds of formal \nnegotiations with Iran in the past two years. While \neveryone says the meetings have been productive, the \nfact remains we have not seen any change in Iran\u2019s \nactions. Next year, nothing would make Canada more \npleased than to see a change in Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, \na change to its terrible human rights record and an end \n\n\n\f\nto its material support for terrorism, including for \nHizbullah.\n\nNow is the time for the global community to \nmaintain tough sanctions against Iran so that the country \ntakes a different path on its nuclear programme. The \nIranian people want peace, and they are suffering great \nhardship because of their Government. Canada wants \nthe Iranian people to be able to access a life of freedom \nand prosperity for themselves.\n\nHow do we as a human family achieve and maintain \nprosperity? We do so through free trade among open \nsocieties operating under transparent, consistent and \nfair rules. Canada continues to diversify its markets \nbecause it is a trading nation. We are aggressively \npursuing free-trade agreements with other nations. \nBounded by three oceans, with the second-largest land \nmass in the world, Canada is literally open to the world. \nWe are both deepening existing economic relationships \nand building new ones. Whether with China, which \nis now Canada\u2019s second-largest trading partner, or \nthe countries of the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations, where Canadian trade and investment ties are \ndramatically increasing, or the Pacific Alliance, which \nprovides new and exciting opportunities, or the European \nUnion, where we are negotiating a comprehensive free \ntrade agreement, Canada and Canadians are supporting \nmarket liberalization. In the process, ordinary lives are \nbecoming enriched and entire societies stronger.\n\nBut the quest for prosperity must never come at the \nexpense of our commitment to freedom. Prosperity is \ninextricably linked to peace. After all, those who lack \nsecurity usually lack the means to provide for themselves \nand their families. With economic opportunity, a fruit \nvendor in Tunisia may not have felt compelled to end his \nlife seeking the dignity to provide for his own family. A \nyoung man in Afghanistan may never feel compelled to \njoin terrorist elements simply to raise his children and \nensure that their lives are better than the one he lived.\n\nI will always remember the 7-year old girl that I \nmet at Zaatari refugee camp, in Jordan. Her parents \nhad made the difficult decision to leave their home and \nto seek refuge in another country, braving hardship \nbecause they were motivated, like all parents, by the \ndesire to keep their family safe. I asked the young girl \nhow she was doing. With tears in her eyes, she said \nsimply, \u201cI do not like it here. I want to go home.\u201d It was \nabsolutely heartwrenching. And millions of people are \nin the same tragic position around the world \u2014 millions \nof members of the human family who cannot even begin \nto contemplate prosperity until a more basic need, their \nneed for security, is addressed.\n\nThe global family will never achieve the prosperity \nthat is our full potential unless we address the peace and \nsecurity concerns that constrain human opportunity. \nEveryone has an interest in contributing to the solution, \nbecause peace and prosperity ultimately ensure the \nfreedom of the individual. That is why we need the \npeople of these United Nations gathered here to promote \nthat freedom: freedom from oppression, freedom from \ndiscrimination, freedom to worship, to think, to speak, \nto love, to believe \u2014 freedom to be.\n\nHuman freedom can be exercised and, sadly, \nlimited in far too many ways. Religious persecution \ncontinues in too many places. Since we gathered \nhere last year, the world has witnessed bombings of \nmosques in Iraq and Pakistan and Catholic churches in \nTanzania; attacks against Hindu, Buddhist and Muslim \nplaces of worship in Burma and Bangladesh; the bloody \npersecution of Christians in Syria; attacks on Coptic \nChristian churches in Egypt; attacks on a mosque \nand on a Catholic church in Sri Lanka; the detention \nof Sri Lankan Muslim leader Azad Sally; the murders \nof Catholic worshippers in Nigeria; and the Iranian \nregime\u2019s ongoing persecution of the Baha\u2019i.\n\nCanada this year opened an Office of Religious \nFreedom. Its mandate is to promote freedom of religion \nand belief as a foreign policy priority, and to combat the \nenslavement into fear by those who seek to intimidate \nand undermine the right to worship freely in peace \nand in harmony. We reject the pernicious notion that \nhuman dignity can be sliced up, compartmentalized or \ncompromised. In a pluralistic society, it is impossible \nto protect some human rights and freedoms while \ninfringing others. All freedoms are rooted in the \ninherent dignity of human beings.\n\nWhether the issue is religious freedom, sexual \nfreedom, political freedom or any other freedom, \nsome people ask: What business is it of ours? What \ninterest do we have in events outside our borders? \nOur business is a shared humanity. Our interest is the \ndignity of humankind. Many assaults on human dignity \nhave common roots. I refer to neo-fascist ideology \nmasquerading in different forms, and the threat that it \nposes to individual freedom.\n\nI spoke earlier of the anniversary of the Munich \nAgreement. What the signatories claimed as a triumph \n\n\n\f\nof practical politics was in fact a craven capitulation \nthat betrayed human dignity and bankrupted the \npeace it purported to secure. It was wrong then to \nunderestimate and to appease fascism, just as it is now \nto underestimate its modern incarnation. Extremism \nthat subjugates human dignity and crushes individual \nfreedom beneath rigid ideology must be opposed for \nwhat it is.\n\nOne year ago, the world lost the great Somali poet \nknown as Gaarriye. Although his pen has been silenced, \nthe inspiring words remain. He wrote: \u201cAnd tell them \nthis: our purpose is peace; our password \u2018freedom\u2019; \nour aim, equality; our way, the way of light.\u201d. In \nother words, peace, prosperity and freedom \u2014 three \nuniversal human priorities. Like the three handles of a \nmug from which we all drink, they are three values that \nall humankind shares.\n\nAs I close, I cannot help but reflect on the three \nyoung girls, and my heart breaks for them: the child \nbride who said, \u201cIt was the day I left schoo.\u201d; the young \ngirl who was a victim of rape and sexual violence; the \nrefugee who said, \u201cI just want to go home\u201d. We are not \nhere to achieve results for Governments or political \nleaders. We are here to protect and defend those three \ngirls and 7 billion other members of the human family. \nLet us remember that as we embark on discussions to \nshape a new global agenda, focusing on those most in \nneed.\n\nI am confident that everyone here feels the \noverwhelming honour and privilege it is to serve \nour people. It is not without great challenge and \nresponsibility, but we all must stand up and deliver on \nthat unique mandate for the people, for it is the people \nwho expect nothing less.\n"

        "file_text": "I \nwould first like to congratulate you warmly, Sir, on \nyour election to the presidency of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-eighth session, and to renew our support \nfor and highlight the efforts that Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon has made at every level to enable our \nOrganization to fulfil its role and responsibilities in \ndealing with the challenges of today\u2019s world.\n\nWe commend your choice of theme for our debate, \nSir, \u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: setting \nthe stage\u201d, which is very relevant and enables us to \nexchange views. From this rostrum, we pay tribute to \nthe Secretary-General\u2019s tireless efforts to integrate the \nMillennium Development Goals into the Organization\u2019s \nstrategic objectives. We hope that are our deliberations \nwill help to strengthen international consensus on \npursuing the complete and integrated fulfilment of our \ncommitments and on formulating a road map with clear \ndirections and specific goals for the post-2015 period.\n\nMorocco, while itself a stable country, is part of the \nSahel-Sahara region, which is highly unstable \u2014 hence \nthe importance for the Kingdom of Morocco of the \nsituation in the brotherly country of Mali and the \ndangerous challenges it has been dealing with recently. \nWe congratulate our Malian and African brothers and \nthe international community on the success of the \nrecent elections there and the progress Mali has made \nin achieving stability. The international community \nshould continue to support it at every level. The visit of \nHis Majesty King Mohammed VI to Mali to participate \nin the investiture ceremony for the new President of \nMali afforded an excellent opportunity for Morocco \nto renew its wholehearted commitment to supporting \nMali\u2019s security, unity, stability and development. In \nhis speech, King Mohammed said that the solutions to \nother security crises demonstrated that the crisis in Mali \nrequired an approach that went beyond mere security. \nThat is why we support a three-pronged approach. The \nfirst dimension would be educational and ideological \nand would aim at spreading a culture of moderation \nand centrism and instituting a dialogue between the \ntwo peoples and their States, leading to the launching \nof cooperation in Islamic affairs and the training of \n500 mosque imams to be sent to Mali.\n\nThe second dimension would consist of \ndevelopment, with emphasis on bringing developing \ncountries together, particularly countries stricken by \ndrought and poverty, among other problems and crises, \nand empowering their people, as well as strengthening \ntheir capacity to achieve progress and development. \nThat is why we have launched development programmes \nin coordination with Mali and other countries in the \nregion.\n\nThe third key thrust would be the humanitarian \ndimension. Security crises provoke unspeakable \nsuffering for individuals and countries. Mali has seen \ntens of thousands of refugees leave the country and go \nto neighbouring countries, which is why it is important \nthat there be a coordinated regional approach. In \nBamako, the capital of Mali, we established a country \nhospital to relieve the suffering of the people in that \narea.\n\nWith respect to the Great Lakes region, the Kingdom \nof Morocco welcomes the signing of the Peace, Security \n\n\n\f\nand Cooperation Framework Agreement, which will \ngreatly facilitate the real settlement of the crisis in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, which has gone on \nfor too long. We hope that all parties will respect the \nFramework Agreement and that they will honour their \ncommitments and pledges and support the international \ncommunity\u2019s efforts to establish a peace process, while \nrespecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of \nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nThose challenges are part of various crises that we \nsee occurring in the Sahel and Saharan regions. The \nSecretary-General has deployed many efforts along \nthose lines. We are pleased with the high-level dialogue \non the Sahel that he organized on the margins of the \nGeneral Assembly for the second consecutive year, \nas well as the visit he hopes to make to the region, \naccompanied by a representative of the World Bank. \nWe hope that the United Nations integrated strategy \nfor the Sahel will be finalized. Once again, Morocco \nreiterates that it will participate in all efforts to protect \nthe countries of the Sahel and the Sahara in order to \nstrengthen stability, security and development in the \nregion.\n\nMorocco reaffirms once more the need to set up \ninitiatives for the Atlantic coast States, given their \nsecurity, political, economic and social interrelationship \nand the challenges that obtain. We believe that \nstability and security in the region go beyond regional \nframeworks. We are therefore talking about a Sahel-\nMoroccan space for the purpose of maintaining stability \nin the region.\n\nWe condemn the recent terrorist attacks in Kenya. \nWe would ask the international community for greater \nefforts to bolster security and stability in that region.\n\nThe second issue that concerns us and the rest of \nthe international community is Syria. In that respect, \nwe commend the international community and the \nSecurity Council for adopting resolution 2118 (2013), \non the Syrian chemical weapons programme, and \nthe announcement of the date of 15 November for \nthe holding of the \u201cGeneva II\u201d Middle East peace \nconference in order to stop the violence in Syria and \nreach a political solution through dialogue that would \nmaintain the territorial integrity of Syria and the \nstability of its neighbours. In that regard, I would like \nto thank the Secretary-General for his efforts. I would \nalso like to thank the Secretary-General of the League \nof Arab States, the League itself, its member States \nand Joint Special Envoy Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi for the \njoint efforts they have made during this period with \nregard to the shedding of Syrian blood, the agreeing \non a resolution and the reaching of a solution prior to \nGeneva II, with a view to putting an end to the crisis \nin Syria.\n\nWe would like to reaffirm once again the \nimportance of the humanitarian aspect of the crisis. \nThere are 2 million refugees and tens of thousands \nof displaced persons, and thousands have been killed \nor wounded. This is the degree of suffering that the \ninternational community is called upon to reduce. The \nKingdom of Morocco and its King have paid particular \nattention to the humanitarian dimension, which is \nwhy we established a rural hospital in Jordan a year \nand a half ago to provide health services to our Syrian \nbrothers.\n\nIt is well known that Morocco has been involved in \nthe establishment of a Maghreb Union. Now is the time \nfor coming together regionally, not for isolation. It is the \ntime for cooperation and openness, not for unilateralism. \nTherefore, we are reactivating the Maghreb Union \nproject in order to fulfil the hopes of the peoples of \nthe five Maghreb countries and to help them to achieve \nstability, prosperity and sustainable development. \nHis Majesty the King has called for a promising and \nambitious Maghreb Union, and the Secretary-General \nhas made a similar appeal. The Maghreb Union would \nimplement peace and stability by taking a number \nof initiatives, including a joint mediation initiative \nundertaken with neighbourly Spain, pursuant to the \nappeal by the General Assembly in favour of mediation. \nThe Kingdom of Morocco answered the call by launching \nthe initiative and establishing partnership agreements \nbetween Moroccan and Spanish mediation centres to \nprovide training and invite the participation of other \ncountries in the region. The initiative was launched in a \nspirit of rapprochement, dialogue and cooperation and \nto promote mediation, which is important not only to \nstop conflicts when they have broken out but also to \nprevent them from occurring in the first place.\n\nThe Kingdom of Morocco\u2019s decision to protect \nhuman rights is irreversible. It is part of a comprehensive \nstrategy and relies on an approach that favours the \nparticipation and advancement of people and the \nprotection of their dignity within the framework of a \ndevelopment-focused democratic model. Morocco has \ntherefore launched a number of projects and workshops, \nas well as major reforms, and made tremendous \n\n\n\f\nprogress in broadening the sphere of individual and \ncollective rights and freedoms, of preserving human \ndignity and of strengthening the protection of the rights \nof its citizens, especially the rights of women, children \nand persons with special needs.\n\nIn its amended 2011 Constitution, the Kingdom \nof Morocco dedicated a chapter to respect for human \nrights as they are recognized internationally. Morocco \nhas always desired to preserve a balance between \nits international and national commitments and \npriorities. As a founding member of the Human Rights \nCouncil, Morocco has participated effectively and \nconstructively in the formulation and implementation \nof the institutional texts of the Council, in particular \nthe universal periodic review. When it was decided \nto take another look at the rules and mechanisms in \n2011, Morocco was given the task of conducting the \nnegotiations on them. At the same time, the Kingdom \nof Morocco enjoyed positive cooperation with the \nvarious institutions and mechanisms and interacted \nwith their recommendations, in particular the universal \nperiod review, treaties and special measures, whose \nassessments Morocco continues to welcome, facilitate \nand answer with its observations. Morocco hopes to \ngain the Assembly\u2019s support for its candidacy for the \nHuman Rights Council for the period 2014-2016, in \norder to further contribute to strengthening the role of \nthe Council and to ensure the effectiveness necessary \nfor its operation.\n\nIn that connection, we have recently launched \nan initiative relating to immigration, especially \nillegal migration. Morocco wished to establish other \nmechanisms for refugees in connection with how we \naddress the issue and rights of immigration, especially \nillegal migration, and asylum. A few days ago, a new \nstatute on immigration was enacted and the right \nto asylum, so as to give new rights and documents \nto political refugees. All of this is a very important \ndevelopment for our country.\n\nI would like also to touch on the key issue of the \nterritorial integrity of Morocco and the issue of the \nMoroccan Sahara. For several years now our authorities \nhave followed the diligent efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral and the Security Council to resolve the Sahara \nissue. Morocco complies with all Security Council \nresolutions and has acted in good faith with respect to \nthose resolutions and to the efforts of the Secretary-\nGeneral. The most recent resolutions called for a \nnew round of negotiations among the parties so as to \nachieve a sustainable political solution accepted by all. \nMorocco therefore launched an initiative on autonomy, \na practical and moderate solution that enjoyed the \nsupport of many countries friends of Morocco as well \nas of several regional organizations. Unfortunately, \nhowever, the other parties involved, committed to their \n30-year stance and proposals, did not allow progress to \nbe made in the political process. I reiterate that Morocco \nis committed to working effectively and in good faith \nwith the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy in \nall their efforts and with the Security Council in order \nto implement the successive resolutions adopted by the \nSecurity Council.\n\nFinally, on behalf of the Kingdom of Morocco, I \nwish to say that with the approach of the seventieth \nanniversary of the founding of the Organization, we \nreaffirm our sincere commitment to its principles and \nto the active mobilization of our efforts so as to update, \nempower and strengthen it, given that it is the unique \nand optimal framework for meeting current and future \nchallenges.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf \nof Spain, I would like to congratulate Ambassador Ashe \non his new responsibility as President of the General \nAssembly and to convey to him our firm support and \nbest wishes. His abilities are a guarantee of good work \nfor the next 12 months. I would also like to thank his \npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi., for his \neffective work during the past year and to wish him \nsuccess in his new role.\n\nThis General Assembly is the hub of the international \nsystem. In it, we all have the same rights, regardless of \nour size, population or economic development. It is the \norgan of the United Nations that embodies the sovereign \nequality of States. The decisions we take here present \nthe international community with a body of opinion that \nis difficult to rebut. This is the debating Hall of global \nlegitimacy. We are all permanent members here, and \nit is here that multilateralism takes on its full meaning \nand effect.\n\nSpain has faith in the United Nations and is firmly \ncommitted to the Organization, because we subscribe \ncompletely to the purposes and principles it embodies. \nOur commitment to the United Nations is not mere \nrhetoric. Spain is the sixth largest contributor to the \nsystem. That commitment legitimizes our aspiration to \nserve the goals of the United Nations in the Security \nCouncil in the 2015-2016 biennium. We shall do so in \nthe same spirit of dialogue and consensus as on the most \nrecent previous occasion when the Assembly placed its \ntrust in Spain. In the 10 years that have passed since \nthen, my country has continued to demonstrate by its \nactions its resolve to faithfully serve the goals of the \nUnited Nations \u2014 the maintenance of international \npeace and security, the peaceful resolution of conflicts, \ninternational cooperation for development and the \npromotion and observance of human rights.\n\nThe maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity is a prerequisite for the progress of humankind. \nSpain believes firmly in the threefold values of peace, \nsecurity and development, which is why more than \n130,000 Spanish soldiers have served in United Nations \npeacekeeping operations and humanitarian missions in \nevery region of the world since 1989. Spanish troops \nare currently serving under the blue flag of the United \nNations in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, \nwhere since 2006 they have helped to ensure peace and \nstability in a country that is located in a particularly \nturbulent region.\n\nSpain works to promote disarmament, \nnon-proliferation and arms control, and it took an active \npart in the Arms Trade Treaty negotiations. We have \nalso participated in various international initiatives \nto prevent nuclear terrorism. Spain has suffered the \nviolence of terrorism and knows that new threats from \nnon-State factions call for a global response through \ninternational cooperation. We must comprehensively \nimplement the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism \nStrategy and arrive at a global convention to combat \nthat menace, which transcends borders. The people of \nSpain know from experience that the responsibility for \n\n\n\f\nterrorism lies with the terrorists alone; it is exclusive \nto them and non-transferable, whatever its perpetrators \nmay claim. We should always honour the memory of \nthe victims, which is key to denying social or moral \nlegitimacy to terrorism of any kind.\n\nOur commitment to working for peace and security \nin the world was made evident this year during the \ncrisis in Mali. Spain initially supported the African-led \nInternational Support Mission in Mali, and thereafter \nthe deployment of the United Nations Multidimensional \nIntegrated Stabilization Mission in Mali. Spanish troops \nin the European Union mission in Mali are training \nthe country\u2019s armed forces, which are responsible \nfor ensuring the country\u2019s national sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity, with full respect for human \nrights. Mali is defeating terrorism and has regained \nits territorial integrity, an unquestionable success that \nwe can all be proud of. But it is only the first step. \nThe return to constitutional order, with the holding of \npresidential elections, marks the start of a second phase \nof building the open and inclusive institutions that are \nessential to Mali\u2019s future. In the long term, we must \ncontinue to support development throughout the Sahel \nas the only way to promote security, democracy and \nprosperity in the region.\n\nThe entire Assembly should welcome the role \nplayed by African organizations in that crisis. Special \nrecognition is due to the African Union, which celebrates \nits fiftieth anniversary this year. Spain has very close \nties with Africa. That continent\u2019s concerns are ours, \ntoo. We participate in the African Union\u2019s summits \nand in funding the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s \nDevelopment, and we were the first non-African \ncountry to contribute directly to the African Union \nCommission\u2019s budget. Spain has launched a strategic \npartnership with the Economic Community of West \nAfrican States (ECOWAS) and continues to strengthen \nits ties with other regional organizations in Africa. We \nback up those commitments with genuine support. Over \nthe past four years, Spain has contributed \u20ac100 million \nto ECOWAS and the same amount to the African \nDevelopment Bank.\n\nFor the past two years, we have been witness to \nthe courageous and determined efforts of Arab peoples \nto assert their dignity, consolidate their democratic \nsystems and exclude those who promote violence and \nthe violation of fundamental human rights. The road \nto democracy is not easy, but there cannot and must \nnot be any turning back. Democracy has to be an \neffort undertaken by all of society, working towards \ncoexistence and inclusiveness, an effort which is based \non dialogue, tolerance and respect for human rights. \nThat undertaking should be embraced by every country, \nnot just at the political level but also at the social and \neconomic. To support those processes of democratic \ngovernance, Spain has launched the Masar programme, \naimed at Governments and civil society in North Africa \nand the Middle East.\n\nThe Assembly is aware that the situation in Syria \nhas become an intolerable, heartbreaking human \ntragedy, as well as a growing threat to regional and \ninternational peace and security. The brutal attack with \nsarin gas against civilians in Damascus \u2014 confirmed by \nthe report of the United Nations Mission to Investigate \nAllegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons in the \nSyrian Arab Republic (see A/67/997) \u2014 has been \nwidely condemned in the international community, \nwhich firmly believes that that act must not be repeated \nor go unpunished. \n\nThe proposal by Russia and the United States that \nwill allow international control and the subsequent \ndestruction of all stocks of chemical weapons in Syria \nhas been applauded by all. It is now necessary for the \nSecurity Council to adopt a resolution to establish \na legally binding prohibition on the use of chemical \nweapons in Syria and to ensure their mandatory \ndestruction. Much rests on that question. As the \nSecretary-General remarked, it constitutes a challenge \nto international security, one that if not resolved will \nrepresent a collective failure. \n\nSpain firmly believes that only political dialogue \nbetween the parties will put an end to the increasingly \nviolent conflict, as was highlighted by the report \n(A/HRC/24/46) presented to the Human Rights Council. \nTherefore, we support the efforts of Mr. Lakhdar \nBrahimi, Joint Special Representative of the United \nNations and the League of Arab States for Syria, to \npromote a political transition in Syria. \n\nSpain is confident of the success of the \u201cGeneva \nII\u201d conference. In that respect, I reiterate before the \nAssembly my call to the parties to demonstrate a \nconstructive attitude. Spain will continue to bolster \nthe opposition forces in order to ensure an orderly and \ninclusive transition to democracy. \n\nFinally, it is essential to maintain the humanitarian \neffort to help reduce the suffering of Syria\u2019s internally \n\n\n\f\ndisplaced population and that of the refugees in \nneighbouring countries.\n\nIn a related context, I wish to emphasize that \nthe Middle East peace process is taking on a new \nperspective. Last year, in this very forum, it was \ndecided by a significant majority to recognize Palestine \nas a United Nations Observer State. The current \nnegotiations are perhaps the last chance to reach a \njust, comprehensive and lasting peace for the two \nStates, Israel and Palestine, to live in peace, security \nand prosperity. At this crucial time for the region, the \npolitical leaders concerned, with the support of the \ninternational community, must take the bold decisions \nnecessary to achieve the historic goal of peace, and \nthereby promote stability in the entire region and the \nworld.\n\nMy country is a staunch advocate of dialogue and \nthe use of peaceful means for the settlement of disputes. \nWe believe that conflict prevention is one of the main \ninstruments for ensuring peace and security. Therefore, \nwe have participated in the Peacebuilding Commission, \nthe establishment of the Alliance of Civilizations and \nthe establishment, with Austria and Saudi Arabia, of \nthe King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz International Centre \nfor Interreligious and Intercultural Dialogue. \n\nWe believe in mediation for the peaceful settlement \nof disputes. That is why we are a member of the United \nNations Group of Friends of Mediation. Within the \nGroup, together with Morocco, we have launched the \ninitiative on mediation in the Mediterranean region, \nwhich has recently started producing results. \n\nThe General Assembly has developed a consolidated, \nuniversal legal doctrine on decolonization, which Spain \nhas endorsed wholeheartedly. Once again, I must submit \nto the Assembly the question of Gibraltar, which the \nOrganization included in 1963 in the list of Non-Self-\nGoverning Territories awaiting decolonization. The \nonly such territory remaining in Europe, it affects our \nterritorial integrity.\n\nSince that date, the United Kingdom has ignored the \nmandate of the General Assembly and the commitment \nmade to Spain in the 1984 Brussels Declaration. That \nanachronism continues to inconvenience the citizens of \nGibraltar and the surrounding area. Resting its case on \nthe legitimacy granted by the universal doctrine of the \nGeneral Assembly, Spain once again reiterates its call \nto the United Kingdom to resume bilateral dialogue and \nregional cooperation. \n\nWestern Sahara remains one of the unresolved \nissues at the United Nations. Spain supports the search \nfor a fair, lasting and mutually acceptable solution, \none that provides for the self-determination of the \npeople of Western Sahara within the framework of the \nUnited Nations and in accordance with the purposes \nand principles of the Charter. Accordingly, Spain fully \nendorses the work carried out in that respect by the \nSecretary-General and his Personal Envoy.\n\nI would like to highlight the contribution of \nLatin America and its regional organizations to \nmultilateralism. Their constructive input on global \nissues, such as the environment and development, is \nof fundamental importance. During the forthcoming \nIbero-American Summit in Panama, we will address \nglobal challenges in the political, economic and social \ncontexts and offer some joint responses. \n\nThe General Assembly has declared 2013 the \nInternational Year of Water Cooperation. The human \nright to water and sanitation is essential for sustainable \ndevelopment and the fight against poverty. That is why, \nin 2008, Spain set up the Cooperation Fund for Water \nand Sanitation, endowed with $1 billion for projects in \nLatin America. Moreover, conscious of the strategic \nvalue of water in ensuring peace and security, Spain \nand Algeria have planned to launch a water strategy for \nthe Western Mediterranean. \n\nThanks to the work of the United Nations, there \nis broad awareness of the crucial importance of the \nfight against climate change, which is a direct and \nimmediate priority. Next year will be the year of the \nsmall island developing States and will provide an \nexcellent opportunity to jointly address the problems \nthey face. Their efforts to adapt to climate change and \nto mitigate its harmful effects must be supported, as \nthey produce the least pollution yet suffer the most \nfrom its consequences. \n\nAs a nation, Spain acts in solidarity and has \nmade every effort to promote the achievement of \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It has \nchannelled its solidarity through the multilateral \nsystem of the United Nations in the belief that that \nsystem guarantees the principle of neutrality in the \nallocation of funds to effectively achieve the ultimate \ngoal, namely, the eradication of poverty.\n\nIn 2007, Spain, together with the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme, established the MDG \nAchievement Fund, which has had a real impact on \n\n\n\f\nthe lives of 20 million people through more than \n130 programmes in 50 countries, disbursing almost \n$1 billion. The evaluation of the Fund, which concludes \nits activities this year, will be a key reference both for \nanalysing compliance with the MDGs and for developing \nthe post-2015 development agenda. The preparation of \nthat agenda is the central theme of this session of the \nGeneral Assembly. For Spain, the post-2015 agenda \nshould be focused on truly sustainable development, \nshould be universal and should acknowledge the \nimportance of transparent institutions in achieving \ninclusive growth.\n\nWe must therefore clearly define the sustainable \ndevelopment goals in order to complete the process \nthat began in Rio de Janeiro last year. However, it must \nnot be forgotten that only a little more than two years \nremain to achieve the MDGs. While we can be pleased \nwith the progress made in many areas, there is still a \nlong way to go. \n\nAs the Spanish economy starts to grow again, we \nwill significantly support these efforts with generous, \nintelligent and effective investment in development \ncooperation. \n\nMy country\u2019s solidarity can also be seen in terms of \nhumanitarian aid, for which Spain is the world\u2019s eighth \nlargest donor. The United Nations is able to respond \nto humanitarian crises in West Africa and the Sahel \nfaster and more effectively, thanks to the World Food \nProgramme humanitarian aid storage and distribution \ncentre that we built in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.\n\nSpain has always been a crossroads of cultures, \nreligions and traditions. Ours is an open, pluralistic \nand tolerant country that respects and integrates the \ndiversity that comes with globalization. The protection \nand promotion of human rights is a responsibility of the \ninstitutions to which all citizens must contribute. Spain \nwas the third country in the world to ratify the Optional \nProtocol to the International Covenant on Economic, \nSocial and Cultural Rights, and I urge other States to \ndo likewise.\n\nWe also take a special interest in promoting the \nrights of persons with disabilities. That is why we \njoined the Philippines in co-facilitating the outcome \ndocument of the High-level Meeting on the Realization \nof the Millenium Development Goals for Persons with \nDisabilities (resolution 68/3), which took place just a \nfew days ago. I am proud to say that in recognition of \nthat commitment, Spain has been awarded the Franklin \nD. Roosevelt International Disability Rights Award, \nwhich Her Majesty Queen Sofia accepted a few days \nago in this very city.\n\nWe will also continue to support the work of \nUN-Women, as we have since its inception. Equality \nbetween women and men, the full participation of \nwomen in all areas, and efforts to end violence against \nwomen and girls are indispensable for true development \nand constitute a priority for Spain, both nationally and \ninternationally.\n\nOur commitment to multilateralism is inseparable \nfrom our desire for a decisive and efficient United \nNations. That is why this session of the General \nAssembly must tackle the issue of Security Council \nreform, which can be achieved only through the \nbroadest possible consensus founded on the principles \nof accountability, transparency and cooperation, with a \nview to enhancing the legitimacy of and support for the \nCouncil\u2019s actions.\n\nIt is also necessary to bring the Organization \ninto line with its means and to rationalize resources \nso that, together, we may achieve more with less. We \ntherefore give our unconditional support to the progress \nbeing made towards system-wide consistency and the \n\u201cDelivering as one\u201d initiative, to which Spain is the \nleading contributor. At the same time, the universal \ncharacter of the United Nations means that we must \npreserve its multilingualism.\n\nIn 2005, Spain announced its candidacy to become a \nnon-permanent member of the Security Council for the \n2015-2016 biennium. My speech today has underlined \nthe main reasons why I believe that Spain has shown, not \nwith mere words but with concrete actions, its readiness \nto serve the United Nations in the Security Council, \nwith the same commitment to dialogue and solidarity \nthat we have shown since joining the Organization. We \nhave but a single objective: to uphold human dignity. \nAll our efforts in favour of peace, freedom, democracy, \njustice, human rights and sustainable development are \ndirected towards that goal. Spain knows that its efforts \nto uphold human dignity will bear greater fruit through \nthe United Nations, just as the General Assembly may \nbe sure that, in this endeavour, it can count on Spain.\n"

        "file_text": "I am particularly pleased to present our warmest \ncongratulations to the President on the occasion of \nhis election to preside over the General Assembly at \nits sixty-eighth session. I am convinced that he will \nspare no effort to strengthen the gains made and to \nfirmly establish international peace and security, so \nas to create an international system in which all of \nmankind enjoys well-being, stability and progress. The \nPresident\u2019s experience and political skills in heading \nhis country\u2019s Mission for over a decade are also factors \nthat make him a natural leader during this session.\n\nI should also like to praise the efforts of his \npredecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremi., and commend him for \nhis interest in the problems of the African continent and \nhis efforts to strengthen the principle of dialogue as an \neffective tool for consultation and the role of the rule of \nlaw and good governance.\n\nI would also like to thank the Secretary-General, \nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his unflagging efforts in the \nservice of international peace and security and his \nfocus on climate change issues and the fight against \nfamine and deadly diseases, as well as on realizing the \nMillennium Development Goals.\n\nLast June, in the important speech that the \nPresident delivered to the General Assembly on the \noccasion of his election to preside over the sixty-eighth \nsession (see A/67/PV.87), he outlined his ambitious \nprogramme of action, which takes into account the \nparticipation of women, youth and civil society in \nthe post-2015 development agenda, the role of South-\nSouth cooperation, the role of human rights and the \nrule of law, and the role of information technology and \ncommunication in the proposed development agenda. \nThose are important topics, and we thank him for \nincluding them.\n\nOver the past two decades \u2014 in step with the Human \nDevelopment Report \u2014 some developing countries have \nexperienced substantial economic change. However, the \nmajority of developing countries, especially the least \ndeveloped ones, remain very far from achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals. On the threshold \nof 2015, it behoves us today to implement plans and \nprogrammes that take into consideration the failures \nof the past and the challenges of the future and to \neffectively prepare the post-2015 development agenda. \n\nIn that regard, we call upon the wealthy countries \nof the world to live up to their promises regarding \nthe financing of development programmes in those \ndeveloping countries that have such pressing needs. \n\n\n\f\nWe also call upon those countries to implement an \nappropriate policy, under the supervision of the United \nNations specialized agencies and in cooperation with \nthe international financial institutions, that will be \nbased primarily on the following: support for health \nand education systems; debt forgiveness; the transfer \nof the necessary technology; the improvement of \nNorth-South trade; the removal of customs duties on \nexports from the developing countries, especially the \nleast developed countries, to the markets of the North; \nthe promotion of South-South cooperation, which will \nprobably strengthen economic cooperation between \ngroup members; the establishment of new international \nmechanisms that will be charged with overseeing \nregional complementarity, strengthening South-South \nrelations, as underscored in the aforementioned Human \nDevelopment Report, which will facilitate the sharing \nof know-how, lessons learned and technology transfer \nbetween those countries.\n\nUnder the leadership of the President of the \nRepublic, Mr. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, our \nGovernment is working to improve the standard of \nliving of our citizens, despite our limited resources. \nIn order to attain that objective, the Government \nhas pursued a rigorous educational policy, based on \ncompulsory and widespread primary education and the \nstrengthening of a modern secondary education with \nfree higher education in several different fields. Basic \nschooling is now available in almost all of our villages \nand cities. That was made possible thanks to the \nGovernment policy of limiting anarchic urbanization \nby merging numerous villages.\n\nWith regard to secondary education, all the \ndepartments throughout the country now have middle \nschools and many have high schools. That has allowed \nthe children of people living in remote villages to \ncontinue their secondary schooling. High schools \nreserved for the most promising students were also \nestablished to take advantage of their talents and steer \nthem towards specializations that meet the needs of the \nlabour market. Higher education took a large qualitative \nstep forward. A university campus has just been \ncompleted in Nouakchott. An Islamic studies university \nhas been opened in the interior of the country, as well as \nfour specialized schools of higher education, including \nthe School of Mines, the Polytechnic, the School of \nAgricultural Training and Public Works. The Faculty \nof Medicine has been strengthened and endowed with \nthe means necessary to cover the shortfall in medical \npersonnel in our country, in addition to the creation \nof four medical schools to train nurses and senior \ntechnicians.\n\nHealth, which goes in line with education, is a major \nchallenge for developing countries and the African \ncontinent in particular. Given that, our Government \nhas allocated an important percentage of its budget for \nthat vital sector and has created national programmes \nto fight against such deadly diseases as AIDS, malaria \nand tuberculosis. In that connection, we have created \nfour new fully equipped hospitals in various parts of \nthe country, in addition to 70 primary-care clinics. \nWe must also note the construction of a specialized \noncology hospital, which is considered to be among the \nmost sophisticated in the region. The health-care sector \nalso works closely with United Nations specialized \nagencies in organizing ongoing vaccination campaigns \nfor children under 5 years of age. \n\nAs with most developing countries, our country \ndepends on imports of basic goods from the global \nmarket, which weighs heavily on our balance sheets, \nespecially since the prices of such products are subject \nto fluctuations in the world market. Aware of that, our \nGovernment has pursued an economic and financial \npolicy that would alleviate the effects generated from \noutside. Our agricultural sector has therefore been \nable, thanks to the policy, to fulfil 60 per cent of the \ncountry\u2019s rice needs and 37 per cent of its need for other \ngrains. Wheat crops, which were recently introduced, \nhave begun to produce. \n\nIn that context, a sugar-cane cultivation project was \nlaunched to make sugar available locally. Generally, \nour Government has worked tirelessly in all sectors to \nensure that its citizens can live in dignity. A free-trade \nzone has been created in Nouadhibou \u2014 the economic \ncapital of the country and the third-largest city in \npopulation \u2014 which will transform the region into an \nimportant economic centre benefiting the country and \nthe region as a whole.\n\nIn order to strengthen good governance and the \nfight against corruption, the Inspector General and the \nCourt of Auditors have been revitalized since President \nMohamed Ould Abdel Aziz took office. Significant \nfunds in some sectors have been poorly managed, \nbut have been reimbursed to the State. Civil servants \nhave been made accountable for the poor allocation of \ncertain resources. Agreements were reached to end the \nno-bid contract system. The lack of competitive bidding \n\n\n\f\nhas undermined equity among the various economic \ndrivers of national and international markets.\n\nTransparency now prevails in the recruitment \nof civil servants \u2014 thanks to competitive \nexaminations \u2014 fostering equality among men and \nwomen and providing hope to young people. Merit-\nbased candidate selection is now possible, leading to an \nend to nepotism and favouritism.\n\nThe Government\u2019s austerity policy, including its \nreduced administrative budget and increased investment \nbudget, has contributed to the self-financing of the \nmajority of the country\u2019s development projects. The \npolicy has also led to reduced unemployment, which \nnow hovers around 10 per cent. The policies have also \ncontributed to an increased growth rate, which should \nattain, according to current forecasts, more than 6 per \ncent by the end of the year. We have also been preparing \nfor municipal and legislative elections slated for the \nend of the year. That will strengthen good governance \nand allow our citizens to participate in the process of \ndefining the country\u2019s future, and setting political and \neconomic priorities for our country.\n\nOur foreign policy is solidly based on a concern \nfor strengthening good-neighbourly relations and \nnon-interference in the internal affairs of States. \nWe will work with our Maghreb region \u2014 Arab and \nAfrican \u2014 with a sense of duty towards international \nrelations and issues so as to disseminate a culture of \npeace, encourage dialogue and the resort to wisdom, \nand facilitate the role of diplomacy as a means of \nresolving conflicts and avoiding or ending war.\n\nPresident Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, who has not \nwavered in exerting his utmost efforts, as the Head of \nthe African Union Peace and Security Council, to find \nsolutions to certain conflicts in the African continent, \nincluding in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Libya and Mali. He has \nplayed a very important role, through his presence at \nsubregional and international summits, focusing on \npeace and security around the world. \n\nFor a number of years, the African Sahel region has \nbeen subjected to all types of cross-border organized \ncrime, including drug trafficking, arms trafficking, \nillegal immigration and kidnapping. We reiterate our \ncall to the international community to support the \nStates of the region in tackling those dangers, which \nhave recently threatened the very existence of a States \nMembers of the United Nations. That clearly shows \nthat the States of the Sahel cannot tackle the scourge \non their own. \n\nBased on its sense of duty, the Islamic Republic \nof Mauritania, which has stood by Mali since the \nbeginning of the crisis, quickly opened its borders \nto our Malian brothers and sisters who were seeking \nrefuge in our territory. We have provided and continue \nto provide shelter for those individuals. Our capital, \nNouakchott, over many months hosted a series of \nnegotiations between the Malian provisional authorities \nand the Azawad groups, which led to the signing of the \nOugadougou accords, thus facilitating the preparations \nfor the presidential elections. We take this opportunity \nto express our sincere congratulations to the people of \nthe sister nation of Mali and the hope that the changes \nwill lead to a new era of well-being, security and \nprogress.\n\nOur country strongly condemns the horrific \nterrorist attack on the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, which \ncost the lives of dozens of individuals.\n\nFor more than two years, certain countries of the \nArab region have experienced instability owing to the \nso-called Arab Spring. Our country, respectful of the \nprinciple of non-interference in the internal affairs \nof other States, expresses its full solidarity with the \npeoples of those countries. \n\nWith deep concern and worry, we are following the \nmost recent developments in the Syrian Arab Republic. \nWe invite all stakeholders to refrain from violence \nand any escalation of violence and, instead, to follow \nthe logic of dialogue, aimed at finding a peaceful \nsolution so as to spare the brotherly Syrian people from \nsuffering and tragedy. At the same time, with respect \nto the preservation, territorial integrity and sovereignty \nof the Syrian territory, it is our hope that the mission \nof Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, Joint Special Representative \nof the United Nations and the League of Arab States \non the Syrian crisis, will achieve success. It is our firm \nhope that a swift solution can be found that will bring \nan end to the bloodshed, destruction of infrastructure \nand economic devastation in sisterly Syria.\n\nWe hope that the people of Egypt, Yemen, Libya and \nTunisia can quickly conclude their transition periods \nand build democratic institutions that will guarantee \nthe rights and dignity of their citizens in an atmosphere \nof well-being and prosperity.\n\nOur country pays close attention to the situation \nin Western Sahara. We reaffirm our support for the \n\n\n\f\nendeavours of the Secretary-General and his personal \nenvoy in their search for a definitive, lasting, fair and \ncomprehensive solution that is acceptable to both parties. \nSuch a solution would bolster peace and security in the \nregion and facilitate the building of a prosperous Arab \nMaghreb that is in step with the legitimate aspirations \nof its people.\n\nThe Arab-Israeli conflict is considered a source of \nhostility and a threat to peace and security in a vital \nand critical region of the world. It remains so in spite \nof the legal framework and general conditions for the \nsettlement of that dispute that have been established \nover the years by a series of Security Council and \nGeneral Assembly resolutions. Those foundations were \nrecently further backed by the Arab Peace Initiative \nbased on the land-for-peace principle. In spite of all of \nthat, the conflict continues, as it has done for too long.\n\nWe welcome resolution 67/19, of 29 November \n2012, whereby the General Assembly granted Palestine \nthe status of non-Member observer State in the United \nNations. We hope that that resolution will mark the \nbeginning of a new era that will see justice done for the \nPalestinian people and their rights restored through the \nestablishment of their independent and sovereign Sate \nalong the 4 June 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as \nits capital. That would put an end to the suffering of the \nPalestinian people, which dates back to the inception of \nour Organization.\n\nBased on the need to ensure justice, credibility and \nequity in the relations between the two parties to that \nconflict, and out of respect for the relevant resolutions \nand decisions under international law, the international \ncommunity should live up to its historic responsibilities \nwith regard to Palestine. We reiterate our condemnation \nof the ongoing blockade against the Gaza Strip, and \nwe condemn the massacres perpetrated by the Israeli \nwar machine against Palestinian civilians and the \ndestruction of their facilities. We welcome efforts, \nmost recently by the United States Administration, \nseeking the resumption of negotiations between the two \nparties. We hope that those efforts will contribute to the \nrealization of the Palestinian people\u2019s simplest right: \nthe establishment of their independent State.\n\nThe commitments made by the international \ncommunity through the United Nations will go \nunrealized if the people of the world are unable to fulfil \ntheir potential for development, especially in developing \ncountries, to live lives of dignity and freedom, and to \nenjoy justice and equality \u2014 the very lofty principles \nfor which our Organization was created. These are the \nonly guarantees of our success.\n\n"

        "file_text": "I would \nfirst like to express my warm and fraternal gratitude to \nthe President of the Republic of Haiti, His Excellency \nMr. Michel Joseph Martelly, for the trust he has placed \nin me and, above all, for his courage and unwavering \ndetermination to build a new Haiti. I would also like to \ncongratulate Mr. John Ashe, Permanent Representative \nof Antigua and Barbuda, for his election to the \n\n\n\f\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth \nsession, as well as to salute Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon.\n\nI am proud to speak in this forum of modern global \nhistory, one that has witnessed so many great leaders \ndiscussing their vision for a world that is more just and \na humankind that is more enlightened and balanced.\n\nIt has been 13 years since the States Members \nof the Organization, buoyed by the basic values of \nfreedom and equality, met to launch a new world order \nfor development when they adopted the Millennium \nDeclaration (resolution 55/2). It has been a strong period \nfor the United Nations, which continues to stand out \nthrough its efforts to call on the peoples of the world to \nunite to overcome the challenges linked to poverty and \nsocial exclusion.\n\nI speak on behalf of Haiti when I voice our pleasure \nat the increasing vitality of the Organization, which \nover the years has succeeded in preserving the ideals \nof peace and solidarity. My country has always sought, \nwith the United Nations, to provide a better future to \ngenerations to come. We have done so enthusiastically, \nbecause over the past two centuries, Haiti \u2014 the land of \nToussaint Louverture, Alexandre P\u00e9tion, Jean-Jacques \nDessalines and Henri Christophe \u2014 has never missed \nthe great historic events. It is up to all of us to preserve \nthis vital tool for the future of humankind.\n\nThe theme of the sixty-eighth session of the General \nAssembly is \u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: \nsetting the stage\u201d. This is the ideal opportunity for \nHaiti to present to the entire world an initial assessment \nof the work carried out by the Government, work which \nlargely meets the aims of the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) and which allows us to see a burgeoning \nnew Haiti.\n\nBefore presenting those achievements to the \nAssembly, it is important to recall the situation that \nHaiti found itself in when President Michel Martelly was \nsworn in. In January 2010, Haiti was in a particularly \ncritical situation, especially because of the devastating, \nlarge-scale earthquake. The natural disasters following \nthe earthquake exacerbated the already very difficult \nproblems. Despite daily difficulties, Haiti is now \nresolutely and definitively on the path of progress. \nOur country is gradually recovering from the natural \ndisasters it experienced and today is facing the future \nwith confidence. We have adopted effective measures \nand policies that are focused on a strategic long-term \ndevelopment plan.\n\nThe aims underlying our Government\u2019s action go \nhand in hand with the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. However, the development under \nway cannot take place without a deep-seated reform of \nthe public administration and good political governance. \nThat is why the rule of law is one of our priorities. \n\nIn that regard, we have made great strides in 28 \nmonths. A Supreme Council of the Judiciary has been \nput in place to ensure the independence of judges and \nof all the justices appointed to the Court of Cassation. \nThe professionalism of the Haitian National Police \nenables us today to provide and guarantee security and \nto create a climate conducive to investment, which is \nnecessary to combat extreme poverty. The performance \nof our police force has meant that Haiti is now ranked \nas one of the safest countries in the Caribbean. \n\nNext year will mark the tenth anniversary of the \nmilitary and police presence of the United Nations \nin Haiti. The Haitian Government welcomes the \nimplementation of the plan for the gradual withdrawal \nof the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, \nwhich is now possible thanks to the considerable \nprogress achieved in the area of security.\n\nThe implementation of the constitutional \nmechanisms envisaged in the context of the rule of law \nis an ongoing priority for the Government. We have \nmanaged to create a climate conducive to political \nstability and to the expression of ideas and democratic \nvalues. The Haitian press enjoys full freedom, and \nmembers of the political opposition exercise their rights \nwithout restrictions. \n\nI would also like to mention the commitment and \nwork of the Government in consolidating the rule of \nlaw and ensuring the sustainability of democratic \ninstitutions. To that end, the Government continues to \ngive its full support to the transitional college of the \nPermanent Electoral Council to ensure that legislative \nand local elections take place as soon as possible. \nDespite its lack of resources, the Haitian Government \nhas already allocated significant funds to the electoral \nbody. The President of the Republic of Haiti is personally \ninvolved in initiating a dialogue with stakeholders and \npolitical parties and is encouraging them to participate \nin the upcoming elections in order to respect the process \nof democratic change, as it is essential to the rule of law.\n\n\n\f\nWith regard to education, more than 1.2 million \nHaitian children have benefited from the free education \nprogramme put in place by the Government. We have \nachieved that in particular by establishing a universal, \nfree and compulsory education programme. That \nis a major achievement for Haiti, and one that is in \nkeeping with one of the most important Millennium \nDevelopment Goals: the achievement of universal \nprimary education by 2015. The Government is aware \nthat this achievement does not resolve the challenge \nof providing access to quality schooling for everyone. \nThat is a new objective that we are determined to \nachieve. Moreover, an ambitious programme to combat \nilliteracy is under way. It will impact more than 250,000 \npeople in 2014.\n\nWith regard to combating hunger and extreme \npoverty \u2014 another Millennium Development \nGoal \u2014 despite the serious social inequality in Haiti, \nthe Government has made considerable efforts to \navoid a humanitarian crisis. To achieve its goals in the \nfight against extreme poverty, the Government has \ninvested more than $150 million in social assistance \nand protection programmes, which is a first for our \ncountry. The programmes are aimed at helping the most \nvulnerable. \n\nSince 2012, three ministries have been established \nto strengthen public policies for the elimination of \nextreme poverty. The Government is pursuing a \nnational food-security policy that includes a series of 15 \nmeasures that are expected to yield results in the short, \nmedium and long terms. In the short term, the objective \nis, first, to stabilize the price of basic consumer goods \nand, secondly, to provide assistance to those living in \nextreme poverty. In the medium and long terms, the \nobjective is to increase national production and to reduce \nour food dependence. We have also introduced a social \ninnovation that is unprecedented in the history of our \ncountry by initiating a series of social programmes for \nthe most vulnerable groups under the theme \u201cHelp the \npoor\u201d. After one year of operation, those programmes \nare now reaching more than 1 million Haitian people \nliving in extreme poverty: thousands of mothers, \nstudents, older persons, disabled people and victims of \nnatural disasters. \n\nFinally, along the same lines, I would like it to be \nnoted that of the 1.5 million earthquake refugees who \nwere living in tents in subhuman conditions, more than \n1.25 million have now been rehoused.\n\nIn the twenty-first century, people are still starving \nin Haiti. That is unacceptable and intolerable. As \nNelson Mandela said, \u201covercoming poverty is not a \ngesture of charity, it is an act of justice.\u201d For President \nMartelly and myself, combatting extreme poverty is a \ncommitment that we make to history.\n\nIn terms of health care, there are considerable \nchallenges to be met in Haiti. The prevalence of \ncertain diseases, the high rates of infant mortality \nand the shortcomings in health-care infrastructure \nhave deprived millions of Haitians of good-quality \nhealth services. That situation was exacerbated by the \nearthquake in 2010. Furthermore, in October 2010, \nthere was a very serious outbreak of cholera in Haiti, \nfor which the Haitian people continue to pay a heavy \nprice in human lives. \n\nGiven the catastrophic consequences of that \nscourge \u2014 more than 8,000 dead and 650,000 people \ninfected \u2014 the Haitian Government is proposing that \na significant amount of the new global fund to combat \ncholera be earmarked exclusively for the eradication of \nthe disease in Haiti. While we continue to believe that \nthe United Nations has some moral responsibility with \nregard to the outbreak of the epidemic, it is nonetheless \ntrue that the Organization has already supported some \nof the Government\u2019s efforts to combat the disease. \nHowever, those efforts are far from enough. We \nwould therefore like to propose the establishment of \na joint commission, including members of the Haitian \nGovernment and representatives of the United Nations, \nto consider ways and means to definitively eradicate \nthe disease in Haiti.\n\nIn the face of those major public health challenges, \nthe Haitian Government has not stood idly by. Working \nwith our national and international partners and public \nhealth experts, we have managed to curb the spread \nof HIV/AIDS. In terms of treating AIDS today, Haiti \nhas moved from a prevalence rate of 5.5 in 2000 to 2.2 \ntoday, with a projected 1.5 for 2015. Such results are a \njust reward for the years of effort that have made Haiti a \nmodel universally recognized in international scientific \nand academic circles. But we will not stop there. Much \nremains to be done in terms of prevention and treatment. \nWe very much hope that we can definitively halt the \nspread of AIDS and make treatment more affordable. \nIn Haiti, the public health network and the provision \nof health care are largely insufficient. New efforts in \nterms of prevention must be made.\n\n\n\f\nThe question of the environment is of major concern \nto the Haitian Government, because the vegetation \ncover over a very large area has disappeared. In order to \nraise awareness among people about the need to replant \nthat vegetation, large-scale programmes have been \nset up, and others are being drawn up, with the aim \nof meeting the challenges of replanting, reforestation, \nproviding drinking water and sanitation and protecting \necosystems \u2014 all of which have been neglected for \nfar too long. Without appropriate protection of the \nenvironment, there will be no sustainable development; \nno food security is possible for a growing population, \nnor can there be a decline in poverty and misery.\n\nAs set forth in the noble Millennium Development \nGoal on the topic, the Haitian Government, aware of the \nneed for gender equality, has made significant efforts to \nensure equality between Haitian men and women. While \nHaitian society has always accorded an important role \nto women, the Government has undertaken significant \ninitiatives to enable women to have access to highly \nresponsible positions in public administration. Thirty-\nfive per cent of the Cabinet is made up of women, and \nthey have important portfolios. Much remains to be \ndone to ensure the full emancipation of Haitian women, \nparticularly among the most vulnerable populations. In \nour country, women deserve better access to education \nand health-care services.\n\nI conclude by asking the Assembly to observe \nmore closely the new Haiti that has been emerging \nover the past two years despite its day-to-day problems \nand the extremely difficult legacy, of which we are all \naware. That Haiti is one where more girls and boys \ngo to school, where new international-class hotels are \nopening up their doors every day, breathing new life \ninto our tourism, where the economy is growing at the \nrate of 4.6 per cent, where inflation has been stabilized \nat 6.7 per cent, where for the first time foreign direct \ninvestment has increased by more than 19 per cent \nannually, where a fierce fight against smuggling and \ncorruption is being carried out and where today the \nlowest rate of homicide in the Caribbean is seen. The \nnew Haiti is modernizing the old Haiti little by little \nand is adopting courageous reforms. The new Haiti is \nincreasingly focusing on constructive dialogue with the \ncountry\u2019s social partners \u2014 the press, political parties \nand the private sector. That Haiti has the courage to \ninvest in the worst-off and the poorest, despite a degree \nof misunderstanding and some criticism.\n\nA new Haiti is emerging. More than ever before, \nHaiti feels that it is taking its place in the great family of \nthe United Nations and in the international community, \nwithout which many of the achievements of the past \nthree years would not have been possible.\n\nWe are doing a great deal with very little. \nIf the international community had fully met its \ncommitments \u2014 amounting to $10 billion \u2014 made at \nthe 31 March 2010 meeting, the results would be even \nbetter, and the suffering of the Haitian people would be \nless harsh. Today, we are still far from our goal, because \nonly a part of those commitments have been honoured.\n\nBased on its desire for transparency and efficiency \nand to avoid duplication of effort on the part of \nnon-governmental organizations, the Government \nhas stepped up its leadership role and set up a \nmechanism \u2014 the National Coordination Framework \nfor External Development Aid in Haiti \u2014 to take over \nthe management of international assistance.\n\nHaiti is once again present on the regional scene. \nThis year alone our country has hosted three major \nregional summits, including those of CARICOM, the \nMinisters of the Association of Caribbean States, and \nPetrocaribe. During those meetings, there were also \ndiscussions on the best regional strategies to combat \nhunger, abject poverty and exclusion, topics that are in \nline with the Millennium Development Goals. \n\nFinally, the Haiti of which I speak is the one that \nHaitian men and women are working tirelessly to forge \neach and every day. The results are coming; progress \nis already palpable. Our country is no longer on the \nfront pages of the international press owing to repeated \ncoups d\u2019\u00e9tat, social turmoil, insecurity and instability. \nOur country is henceforth stable and secure, thanks \nin particular to the tremendous efforts of the Haitian \nNational Police, with the support of the United Nations \nStabilization Mission in Haiti. \n\nWork on infrastructure and on the reconstruction of \npublic buildings destroyed by the earthquake has begun. \nThe country offers excellent investment opportunities \nin all sectors. Haiti today is on the right track, moving \ntowards a new era of social and economic progress and \nrespect for human rights. We are acting specifically to \nachieve progress towards a Haiti that is more solidarity-\nbased and more prosperous \u2014 a Haiti that the entire \nworld will want to visit to see its extraordinary sights. \nLong live Haiti!\n"

        "file_text": "The Assembly is \nmeeting at a time marked by significant challenges. Let \nme mention a few which I regard as the most pressing.\n\nThe state of the world economy remains fragile, \nbut slowly we seem to be entering a path towards \neconomic recovery and, hopefully, sustainable growth. \nThe security situation in many parts of the world is \nimproving, but we are witnessing many local conflicts \nthat endanger the overall regional balance. The conflict \nin Syria must come to an end on the basis of a negotiated \npolitical settlement. The danger of a nuclear conflict is \ndiminishing thanks to the decreasing number of nuclear \nwarheads and carriers in the possession of the nuclear \nPowers. Yet the currently blocked negotiations with the \nparties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons should be a matter of concern. Fundamental \nhuman rights and freedoms are still at risk in many \ncountries. The gap between the rich and the poor is \never widening despite many efforts to alleviate world \nhunger and poverty. At the same time, some countries \nhave managed to reduce the gap.\n\nInternational cooperation is essential if we want to \naddress those and other challenges. The United Nations \nremains the most suitable body to pool the global \nefforts and resources needed for that task. The world \nis changing, and its traditional platform must adapt \nas well. From the start, we should formulate realistic \n\n\n\f\nplans and procedures. However, their implementation \nwill not be possible without the necessary political will.\n\nA country\u2019s reputation depends not only on its \nsize or economic output, but also on its readiness \nto actively engage in addressing and meeting the \nchallenges of the current globalized world. The Czech \nRepublic, a country with the historical experience of an \nundemocratic regime, is ready to share its experience \nfrom its democratic transition process, as well as to \noffer its help, resources and know-how to countries \nundergoing their own democratic transition.\n\nThe year 2013 will mark a turning point for European \neconomies. The Czech economy is highly dependent on \ninternational trade, and I strongly believe that free and \nfair trade is one of the best tools for improving the world \neconomic situation. The multilateral approach to trade \nissues should be revitalized and cooperation within the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) reinforced. I sincerely \nwish much success to the new WTO leadership.\n\nThe United Nations has always played a key \nrole in defusing armed conflicts between and within \nthe Member States. Its role in helping to resolve the \nconflict in Syria is crucial. The confirmed use of \nchemical weapons in Syria is deeply worrying. Any use \nof chemical weapons is unacceptable. Whoever gave \nthe order to initiate the chemical attack has gravely \nviolated the principle of responsibility to protect the \ncivilian population. The attack constitutes a war crime \nand a crime against humanity, and its perpetrators \nshould be held accountable before the International \nCriminal Court.\n\nThe Czech Republic welcomes the decision of \nthe Executive Council of the Organization for the \nProhibition of Chemical Weapons on the expeditious \ndestruction of Syrian chemical weapons, which is now \nbeing adopted in The Hague, and looks forward to the \nadoption of a Security Council resolution on the issue \nin the coming hours.\n\nThe conflict does not have a military solution; \nonly a negotiated political settlement will re-establish \npeace in Syria. The Czech Republic calls on all \nparties, especially on the Syrian Government, to fully \nimplement the 2012 Geneva communiqu\u00e9 (S/2012/523, \nannex). The Czech Republic supports and will continue \nto support the efforts of the United Nations and the \nInternational Committee of the Red Cross to meet \nthe growing humanitarian needs in Syria and the \nneighbouring countries.\n\nThe Czech Republic acknowledges developments \nin the transformation process of Myanmar. I strongly \nencourage the country\u2019s leaders, in accordance with \ntheir public pronouncements, to actively pursue the \nprocess of amending the national Constitution in order \nto improve democratic standards in the country.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the role of the United Nations \nin resolving armed conflicts is indispensable. United \nNations peacekeeping operations are an important \ntool for sustainable and durable solutions to violent \nconflict worldwide. Having participated in United \nNations operations in recent years in relatively small \nnumbers, my country, the Czech Republic, is ready \nto substantially increase the presence of its military \npersonnel in peacekeeping operations.\n\nThe Czech Republic, a non-nuclear-weapon State, \nhas always strongly advocated for the unfettered \nright to develop, research and use nuclear energy for \npeaceful purposes. Nevertheless, that right should be \nfully exercised only in conjunction with honouring \nall non-proliferation obligations. The long-standing \nobjective of the complete elimination of nuclear \nweapons may be achieved only if the non-proliferation \nregime meets all demands for its strengthening. The \nupcoming meeting of the group of governmental experts \non a fissile material cut-off treaty will be a step in the \nright direction. The Czech Republic greatly appreciates \nthat fact that the international community was finally \nable to complete the Arms Trade Treaty negotiations.\n\nI should like to share my view of the role of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Czech \nRepublic has been actively involved from the very \nbeginning in the discussions on the formulation of a \nnew development agenda. We are ready and committed \nto take part in its implementation. As formulated by the \nSecretary-General in his report (A/68/202), the MDGs \nhave been the most successful global anti-poverty \npush in history and have made a great contribution to \nraising public awareness, increasing political will and \nmobilizing resources.\n\nSome of the MDG targets have been met already; \nsome are within close reach. But the results are uneven \namong and within countries and there is a lot of \nunfinished business. I can assure the Assembly that \nmy Government remains committed to the MDGs, as \nreflected in both our policies and our practical actions.\n\nThe future development agenda should build on \nthe success of the MDGs and bring together diverse \n\n\n\f\ndevelopment actors. I would like to support the single \noverarching post-2015 framework, which will link \npoverty eradication in all its dimensions and the \npromotion of sustainable development. I therefore call \nfor the full integration of all relevant international \nprocesses, which have been separate until now, in \nparticular the review of the MDGs and the work of \nthe Open Working Group on Sustainable Development \nGoals.\n\nWe have to make sure that the future goals will be \nuniversal for all countries but at the same time remain \nrealistic, taking into account the actual possibilities of \neach country. They must be achievable and measurable. \nI appreciate the fact that the report of the High-level \nPanel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda puts \nemphasis on inclusive growth and considers the role of \ninnovation, technology and the private sector actors. \nThe proposed development goal to secure sustainable \nenergy is a very good example and should figure among \nthe future development priorities.\n\nIn December, the international community will \ncommemorate the sixty-fifth anniversary of the \nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \nThe situation of human rights has improved in some \nareas. New human rights challenges have emerged. \nA great deal of work still lies ahead of us. The Czech \nRepublic, a member of the Human Rights Council and \nthe country of V\u00e1clav Havel, will always defend human \nrights wherever they are violated.\n\nIn conclusion, I should like to focus on issues \nrelated to the process of reforming the United Nations. \nThe Czech Republic appreciates the dedicated work \nof the Secretary-General, which is transforming the \nUnited Nations into a more effective and accountable \nsystem. Unfortunately, there are not enough means to \nfund all initiatives. We all have to do more with less. \nI am sure that we will find internal reserves that will \nallow the United Nations to achieve the tasks entrusted \nto it with greater success. By performing well and \nby being responsive to its Member States, the United \nNations will strengthen the political will of its Members \nto invest in multilateral forums and thus contribute to \na safer world.\n"

        "file_text": " This \nevening, as the Chairperson of the Conference of Heads \nof State and Government of the Caribbean Community \n(CARICOM), I am very delighted and honoured to \nextend to President Ashe our congratulations on his \nassumption of the position of President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. His elevation to \npreside over this central organ of the United Nations \nis testimony to the contribution that CARICOM, as \na grouping of small States, continues to make to the \nadvancement of the global agenda for peace, security \nand development. Indeed, it is evidence of the principle \nof the sovereign equality of all States enshrined in \nthe Charter of the United Nations. Nowhere else is \nthat principle more recognizable than in the General \nAssembly. Trinidad and Tobago is confident that the \nPresident will discharge his mandate with distinction \nand in an impartial manner for the benefit of all States.\n\nIn 2000, world leaders gathered at the General \nAssembly and launched the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs), which were aimed at achieving specific \ntargets on poverty alleviation, universal education, \ngender equality, child and maternal health, combating \nHIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, environmental \nsustainability, and partnership for development by \n2015. At that time, there was renewed faith in the United \nNations as the vehicle to assist developing countries, \nespecially the most vulnerable, in their efforts to help \nreduce poverty and hunger and to provide an enabling \nenvironment to assist States, working as partners, to \ndevelop their economies so that their peoples may live \nin conditions free of persistent poverty, inadequate \nhealth care and other developmental ills. At that time, \nit was felt that a new chapter was beginning for the \nUnited Nations. It was now being seen as proactive and \nnot reactive.\n\nWhen we look back on the period between \n2000 and the present, what is the reality? What has \nthe international community witnessed since the \ncommitments were made at the Millennium Summit \nin 2000? The evidence shows that progress towards \nachieving the MDGs has been uneven. For us in \nTrinidad and Tobago, we have made some strides in \nachieving the Goals and, indeed, in some cases, we \nhave surpassed them. For example, with respect to the \nMDG related to education, not only have we achieved \nuniversal primary education, we have also achieved \nuniversal secondary education, and we are working \ntowards achieving universal early childhood education. \n\nWe are well aware that a number of countries \nare not on track to realize any of the targets set. By \n2005, and again in 2010, it was evident that greater \nefforts were needed if developing countries as a whole \nwere to meet their MDG targets by the deadline. \nHowever, despite numerous constraints in the difficult \ninternational economic and financial environment, \ndeveloping countries have done much to finance their \nown development. In contrast, many commentators \nhave asserted that developed countries have not done \nenough to honour their commitments or to provide \ndevelopment assistance to their partners, consistent \nwith the agreement reached at the Millennium Summit. \n\nArguably, some developed countries have not done \nenough to reform their trade, tax and transparency \npolicies. Moreover, insufficient attention has been paid \nto appropriate regulation of the global financial and \ncommodity markets. What has happened is that those \nin turn have negatively impacted the ability of many \ndeveloping countries to achieve the MDGs.\n\nSince the 2000 Summit, there has been some \nprogress in the achievement of the internationally \nagreed goals including the MDGs, but there have \nalso been many pitfalls. It has become apparent that \nbusiness-as-usual approaches will not suffice to address \nand eradicate poverty on a global scale; to ensure food, \nnutrition and energy security; to reverse environmental \ndegradation and to deal with climate change.\n\nCurrent approaches will not advance the MDG \nagenda by 2015 or ensure sustainable development in \nthe post-2015 context, as agreed at the June 2012 Rio \nde Janeiro United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment (Rio+20). Transformative change at the \nnational, regional and international levels is what is \nrequired.\n\nIn reflecting on the role of the United Nations in \naddressing the issue of development so that all peoples \nof the world may live in larger freedom, we welcome \nthe outcome document adopted on 23 September for \na renewed commitment to the MDG agenda and the \nintensification of the efforts towards its achievement \nby 2015. We also welcome the decision to launch the \nintergovernmental process that will lead to an agreement \non the post-2015 development agenda, which should \nprovide a new and more inclusive architecture to assist \nus in achieving our global sustainable development \nobjectives.\n\n\n\f\nWe therefore applaud the President for focusing on \nthose efforts. We agree with him that it is an opportune \nmoment to begin the discourse on setting the stage \nfor the post-2015 development agenda. Some of the \npreparatory work has already been done. At the Rio+20 \nConference, world leaders pledged action on sustainable \ndevelopment. We recognized the shortcomings of the \nMDG process and the need to embrace a new partnership \ninvolving Governments, the private sector, civil society \nand multilateral banks, inter alia, to advance action on \nsustainable development.\n\nAs leaders, we agreed to an outcome document to \nchart \u201cThe future we want\u201d (resolution 66/288, annex), \nthat is, a more sustainable future for the benefit of \npresent and future generations. \u201cThe future we want\u201d \naddresses many facets of what is required to stimulate \nsustainable development for all countries. Trinidad and \nTobago was an active partner at that Conference.\n\nToday we say we will continue to support the \nemphasis placed on poverty eradication as the \ngreatest global challenge facing the world today and \nan indispensable requirement for the achievement of \nsustainable development. We are also committed to \nthe work already under way on the establishment of \nthe following sustainable development goals: first, the \ndevelopment of the green economy as a tool for achieving \nsustainable development; secondly, the development \nof measures that go beyond gross domestic product \nin assessing development; thirdly, the adoption of a \nframework for tackling sustainable consumption and \nproduction; and, fourthly, a focus on gender equality \nand the need for greater engagement by civil society in \nnational efforts for sustainable development.\n\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon remarked that \n\n\u201cThe [Rio+20] outcome document provides \na firm foundation for social, economic and \nenvironmental well-being. It is now our \nresponsibility to build on it. Now the work begins.\u201d \nTrinidad and Tobago and many developing countries \nalso shared the sentiments of Her Excellency \nMs. Dilma Rousseff, who said: \u201cI am convinced that \nthis Conference will have the effect of bringing about \nsweeping change.\u201d Therefore, as we begin to set the \nstage for the post-2015 development agenda, Trinidad \nand Tobago respectfully submits that the General \nAssembly must provide the platform for achieving that \nsweeping change, so as to ensure that we realize the \nobjective of integrating sustainable development at all \nlevels for a better world for all of humankind.\nIn keeping with that renewed commitment, we \napplaud the launch of the High-Level Political Forum \non Sustainable Development to provide an appropriate \nlevel of involvement and high-level political oversight \nfor the implementation of our collective sustainable \ndevelopment aspirations. Trinidad and Tobago \ntherefore also supports the President\u2019s announcement \nto commence in a robust manner, during the current \nsession of the General Assembly, deliberations aimed \nat arriving at a development agenda for the post-2015 \nperiod. We support his plans to convene high-level \nevents aimed at addressing women, youth and civil \nsociety; human rights and the rule of law; South-South \ncooperation; and information and communication \ntechnology development. In our view, the topics \nhe has selected to guide the three thematic debates \nscheduled for this session of the Assembly are well \nchosen, namely, the role of partnerships, how stable and \npeaceful societies can contribute to development, and \nthe way water, sanitation and sustainable energy can \ncontribute to the post-2015 development agenda.\n\nThe areas to be tackled at those events demonstrate \nthat the President has a clear vision of the elements needed \nto give effect to the outcome of the Rio+20 Conference, \nwhich embodies the hopes and dreams of the most \nvulnerable members of the international community. \nThat grouping called for the new development agenda \nto embrace the spirit of the Millennium Declaration and \nto maintain the best of the MDGs, but also to go beyond \nthem.\n\nIn my view, it is imperative that those high-level \nmeetings underscore that we must go beyond business \nas usual. There must a coordinated effort to use those \nevents to formulate a development agenda that builds on \nand further accelerates the reduction of poverty levels, \nwhich, since the launch of the MDGs, has already been \nthe fastest reduction in history.\n\nThe discourse must also be people-centred or, as \nsome commentators have postulated, it must be based \non our common humanity. We also find merit in the \ncomments of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons \non the Post-2015 Development Agenda, appointed by \nthe Secretary-General, which indicated that the targets \nto be agreed for the post-2015 development agenda \nshould be monitored closely and \n\n\n\f\n\u201cthe indicators that track them should be \ndisaggregated to ensure no one is left behind and \ntargets should only be considered \u2018achieved\u2019 if they \nare met for all relevant income and social groups\u201d.\nThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago recognizes \nthe importance of having people at the centre of our \ndevelopment goals. Consequently, upon our election to \noffice in 2010, we embarked on a national development \npolicy which is built on the premise of prosperity for \nall. An examination of our national policy will show \nthat in Trinidad and Tobago, we have also observed \nthe importance of an integrated approach to not just \ndevelopment, but development that is sustainable, that \nintegrates the social, economic and environment pillars \nand which is similar to the plan outlined by President \nAshe, to set the stage for the post-2015 development \nagenda.\n\nMy Government has implemented, with varying \nmeasures of success, seven pillars that are intended \nto propel our country\u2019s development in order to \nachieve prosperity for all. I will quickly itemize them: \npeople-centred development, poverty eradication \nand social justice, national and personal security, \ninformation and communications technology, a more \ndiversified, knowledge-intensive economy, good \ngovernance, and foreign policy.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago will continue to do its part in \nassisting the community of nations to craft a post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda to integrate the social, economic \nand environmental dimensions of sustainability.\n\nWe join other small island developing States \n(SIDS) in outlining our many development successes, \nachieved through SIDS leadership, as well as with the \nassistance of the international community. In addition, \nand in keeping with the recognition of SIDS as a special \ncase for sustainable development as a result of our \nunique characteristics, challenges and vulnerabilities, \nwe must also highlight the fact that SIDS have made \nsignificantly less progress in the area of development \nthan other vulnerable groups of countries.\n\nIn some cases, SIDS are on the front lines of \nexperiencing a reversal of many of the gains that \nhave been achieved. In that regard, as Chair of the \nConference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean \nCommunity, I wish to bring to the attention of this body \na matter of significant concern to the States members \nof CARICOM: the situation of small, highly indebted \nmiddle-income countries. Almost as if we were being \npenalized for our relative success in getting ourselves \nout of the morass of poverty, the States members of \nCARICOM that are categorized as middle-income \ncountries have been graduated out of the economic \nspace where they were previously afforded access to \nconcessional financing.\n\nThe use of per capita income to determine a \ncountry\u2019s level of development and its need for grant \nand concessional financing does not provide a true \npicture. Per capita income is, at best, an arithmetic ratio \nthat does not address levels of poverty, distribution of \nincome, levels of indebtedness, vulnerability and the \ncapacity to self-generate sustainable economic and \nsocial development. If one were to add to that the impact \nof natural disasters and the effects of sea-level rise \nand climate change, the fallacy of the middle-income \ncategorization would be wiped out in an instant.\n\nThis issue must be considered within the context of \nSIDS and the post-2015 development agenda. Indeed, in \nthe preparations for our participation in that upcoming \ndiscourse, the recognition of the vulnerabilities of \nsmall island developing States is one of the guidelines \nthat CARICOM will apply when considering its \ncommitments to the overall agenda.\n\nThe economic vulnerability and ability of the \nStates members of CARICOM to build resilience \nare exacerbated by a debilitating debt overhang, \nwhich continues to bedevil the region\u2019s growth and \ndevelopment prospects. Similarly, CARICOM takes \nthe view that the embargo applied to Cuba constitutes \na drag on the sustainable development prospects of that \ncountry and, as such, should be lifted sooner rather \nthan later.\n\nCARICOM\u2019s debt stock currently stands at \napproximately $19 billion, while the debt-to-GDP ratio \nranges from 60 to 144 per cent for many States. Many \nCARICOM States have been recording lower-than-\nsatisfactory growth rates in comparison with other \ndeveloping countries in Latin America and the world \nin general. In the aftermath of the global financial \nand economic crisis, CARICOM States continue \nto experience considerable difficulty in accessing \nreasonably priced development finance, as several of \nthose States have been categorized at middle-income \nstatus and graduated away from access to concessional \nresources from the multilateral financial institutions.\n\nI would therefore respectfully say that it must be \nacknowledged that the debt overhang did not result \n\n\n\f\nfrom profligate spending by CARICOM Governments; \ninstead, it resulted from the makeup of our countries, the \ngeography and history of our countries; our proneness \nto natural catastrophes; and our very small physical \nsize, which does not lessen the per capita cost of \ndevelopment expenditures for the necessary economic \ninfrastructure and the necessary social development \nprojects.\n\nCARICOM States therefore appeal to the \ninternational community to support our call for the \nimmediate review of the very narrow criteria used \nby multilateral financial institutions and even some \ndevelopment partners, which graduate small highly \nindebted middle-income countries away from access \nto concessional resources; and for an early review of \nthe economic and financial situation of graduated small \nhighly indebted middle-income countries with a view \nto developing programmes for the orderly resolution of \ntheir debt overhang, without compromising the future \nprospects of those States.\n\nWe look forward to our participation in the Third \nInternational Conference on Small island Developing \nStates, to be held in Samoa in September 2014, and to \nthe observance of the International Year of Small Island \nDeveloping States, also in 2014. I am of the view that \nboth the Third SIDS Conference and the International \nYear of SIDS come at an opportune time and will \nensure not only the full implementation of the Barbados \nProgramme of Action and its Mauritius Strategy for \nthe sustainable development of SIDS but also that the \nconcerns of SIDS are well articulated and adequately \ntaken into account in the development of the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda.\n\nThe Assembly may recall that during the general \ndebate in 2011, both The Honourable Winston Baldwin \nSpencer, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of \nAntigua and Barbuda, and The Honourable Ralph \nGonsalves, Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the \nGrenadines, put forward the case for reparations for \nthe injustices suffered by African slaves and their \ndescendants, stating that segregation and violence \nagainst people of African descent in the region had \nimpaired their capacity for advancement as peoples \nand nations (see A/66/PV.22). They posited that former \nslave-owning States should begin a reconciliation \nprocess by formally acknowledging the cruelties \ncommitted over the 400 years of the African slave trade.\n\nAt the Thirty-Fourth Regular Meeting of the \nConference of Heads of Government of CARICOM, \nheld in Port of Spain in July this year, consideration \nwas given to the issue of reparations for Caribbean \nslavery and native genocide. Heads of Government \nunanimously agreed to support action on this issue.\n\nCARICOM States therefore urge those Member \nStates that have not yet done so to contribute to the \nUnited Nations trust fund to ensure the erection of \na permanent memorial in honour of the victims of \nslavery and the transatlantic slave trade in a place \nof prominence at United Nations Headquarters. We \nwere very heartened when the winning design for the \nmemorial was unveiled Monday right here at the United \nNations.\n\nWe recognize that peace, security and stability \nprovide an enabling environment for sustainable \ndevelopment. Indeed, national and personal security is \none of the seven pillars of our own national sustainable \ndevelopment strategy. At the international level, we are \nstalwart supporters of the Arms Trade Treaty, agreed to \nin March of this year and which we have already signed. \nToday we deposited our instrument of ratification.\n\nIn the light of our experiences and challenges \nin connection the impact of crime, violence and the \nillicit trade in small arms and light weapons on our \ndevelopment efforts, we would encourage all States \nwhich have not yet done so to sign and ratify the Arms \nTrade Treaty, so that it may come into force at the \nearliest opportunity.\n\nIndeed, I want to note with sadness an incident \nthat occurred only recently. One of our brilliant young \ncitizens, Mr. Ravindra Ramrattan, a former President\u2019s \ngold medalist for academic excellence in Trinidad and \nTobago, was killed last Saturday in the terrorist attack \non the Westgate mall in Nairobi. He no doubt fell \nvictim to illegal guns and other weapons in the hands \nof murderous terrorists. His death is merely one more \nexample of the consequences of illicit cross-border \nflows of arms. \n\nOn the Syrian crisis, it must not be forgotten that \ngood governance, respect for human rights and the rule of \nlaw at the national and international levels are essential \nfor the achievement of sustainable development. In \nthat context, we wish to underscore our grave concern \nabout the escalating humanitarian crisis in Syria, and \nrepeat our call for the situation to be resolved through \ndialogue and not the use of any measures that would \n\n\n\f\nviolate international law. We submit that if there is \nprima facie evidence that individuals committed war \ncrimes during this protracted conflict that fall within \nthe jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, \nsteps should be taken to bring them to justice.\n\nAs we move forward with the work of the Open \nWorking Group on Sustainable Development Goals, \nof which Trinidad and Tobago is a member, we have \nalready seen certain areas in which consensus is \nemerging. I wish to assure the Assembly that the \nGovernment of Trinidad and Tobago will continue to \nbe actively engaged in advancing the President\u2019s efforts \nto utilize the General Assembly as a primary vehicle \nfor engaging in dialogue on the formulation of the post-\n2015 development agenda.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, on behalf of the Botswana delegation, to join previous speakers\nin congratulating President Ashe most sincerely on\nhis assumption of the presidency of the Assembly. His\nelection demonstrates the confidence and high esteem\nin which he personally and his great country, Antigua\nand Barbuda, are held by the States Members of the \nOrganization. We particularly admire his deep passion\nand proven record of leadership here at the United\nNations on issues of sustainable development and\nclimate change. We are therefore confident that the vast\nknowledge and experience of multilateral diplomacy\nwhich he brings to this position will contribute\nsignificantly to the success of this session. May I also\ncongratulate his predecessor, Vuk Jeremi., for his\neffective guidance and sterling leadership of the sixty-\nseventh session.\n\nMy delegation fully endorses the theme he has\nproposed for this session, namely, \u201cThe post-2015\ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage\u201d, including\novercoming poverty and insecurity as well as ensuring\nthe achievement of the sustainable development goals.\n\nThis is quite relevant and fitting given the fact that\nthe international community is on the brink of two\nmajor interrelated developments in the global arena:\nthe imminent target date of 2015 for the achievement\nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and\nthe evolution of the sustainable development goals,\nwhich will constitute a significant part of the post-\n2015 development agenda. We therefore pledge our full\nsupport and cooperation to President Ashe in his efforts\nto usher in a new development paradigm.\n\nThere is no doubt that the challenges of extreme\npoverty, disease, lack of access to affordable energy,\npotable water and sanitation, climate change and\ngender inequality will continue to haunt millions of our\npeople, especially in developing countries.\n\nIt is on account of this that my delegation is of\nthe strong view that the formulation of the sustainable\ndevelopment goals should be predicated on the\noutcome of the current review of the implementation\nof the Millennium Development Goals. To that end, we\nbelieve that the sustainable development Goals should\ncomplement the Millennium Development Goals rather\nthan replace them wholesale.\n\nBotswana has made impressive achievements in the\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals,\nand we have mainstreamed them into our national\ndevelopment planning process. A substantial portion of\nour national budget is allocated to health, education,\ninfrastructure, human resource development and the\nempowerment of women and young people.\n\nI am proud to report that we have achieved universal\nprimary education, as well as universal access to\n\n\n\f\nHIV/AIDS treatment, care and support services.\nWe have drastically reduced the mother-to-child\ntransmission of HIV/AIDS. We are working tirelessly\ntowards achieving zero new infections and zero\nHIV/AIDS-related deaths by 2015.\n\nWe reaffirm our commitment to the fight against\nHIV/AIDS. Central to our efforts is the commitment\nto ensuring respect for human rights and expanding\naccess to prevention, treatment and care support\nservices for affected populations, including those most\nat risk. In addition, we remain committed to providing\na good quality of life for all of Botswana. In that regard,\nwe give the utmost priority to the implementation of\npoverty eradication programmes, with particular focus\non vulnerable communities and vulnerable groups,\nsuch as women, youth, the elderly and persons with\ndisabilities.\n\nDespite all of the achievements we have made to\ndate, serious challenges remain. Permit me to briefly\naddress the vexing subject of climate change and the\nsituation of countries in special categories, including\nmiddle-income countries. Botswana is among the\nsub-Saharan African countries that suffer the most\nfrom the adverse impact of climate change. Some of the\nnotable manifestations of climate change are extreme\ntemperatures, water shortages, land degradation,\ndesertification and persistent drought. Climate change\nalso has adverse impacts on health and food security.\n\nWhile it is gratifying that progress continues to\nbe made in many countries in the implementation of\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange, my delegation believes that more needs to be\ndone, particularly to assist vulnerable countries in arid\nand semi-arid areas and landlocked and transit countries,\nsuch as my own, that are also susceptible to drought\nand desertification. Financial support, technology\ntransfer and capacity-building need to be generously\nextended to that special category of countries in order\nto assist them in adapting to and mitigating the effects\nof climate change.\n\nLast year, Botswana hosted the Summit for\nSustainability in Africa, whose outcome declaration\ncalls upon Governments to ensure that the contributions\nof natural capital to sustainable economic growth and\nthe maintenance and improvement of social capital\nand human well-being are quantified and integrated\ninto development and business practices. We wish\nto commend the work done by non-governmental\nenvironmental organizations worldwide in their\nunremitting efforts to save the planet from climate\nchange and its negative effects.\n\nBotswana welcomes the adoption earlier this year\nof the long-overdue Arms Trade Treaty. The Treaty\nestablishes common international standards for the\nregulation of international trade in conventional arms,\nammunition and parts and components, with a view to\nstrengthening international peace and security. In that\nregard, I am delighted to report that arrangements are\nunder way to facilitate our signing and ratification of\nthat vital instrument in the very near future.\n\nBotswana remains firmly committed to a strong and\neffective international criminal justice system \u2014 hence\nour continued strong support for the mandate and work\nof the International Criminal Court. We believe that\nthe Court has a vital role to play in the fight against\nimpunity, genocide, war crimes, crimes against\nhumanity and the crime of aggression.\n\nIn that regard, last April, Botswana hosted a\nregional workshop for African States parties to the\nRome Statute. The workshop was aimed at encouraging\nAfrican States parties to ratify the 2010 Kampala\namendments to the Rome Statute, which deal with\nthe specific question of the crime of aggression. I am\npleased to say that, following the workshop, Botswana\nbecame the first African State party to ratify the\nKampala amendments. We can only hope that other\nState parties will follow suit so that we can secure the\nrequisite number of ratifications for the amendments to\nenter into force.\n\nTurning now to issues of international peace and\nsecurity, it defies logic that, throughout the course of\nhistory, humankind has unleashed untold suffering on\nhumankind. Conflict is raging in many parts of the\nworld, where innocent lives are being lost needlessly.\nMy delegation wishes to reiterate that States have a duty\nand a responsibility to protect their populations from\nwar crimes and crimes against humanity and to see to it\nthat the perpetrators of such crimes do not benefit from\nimpunity. In situations where it is clear that States have\nfailed or are unwilling to exercise their responsibility to\nprotect, it is only fair and proper that the international\ncommunity should intervene. In that regard, I refer\nmainly to the responsibility of the Security Council.\n\nFor slightly over two years now, the people of Syria\nhave been engulfed in a brutal civil war whose end\nseems nowhere in sight. We remain deeply concerned\nthat Syria continues to be soaked in the blood of its\n\n\n\f\ncitizens. We therefore wish to note our disappointment\nwith those permanent members of the Security Council\nthat continue to frustrate resolutions authorizing\ninterventions seeking a lasting solution to the ongoing\ncarnage in Syria.\n\nIt is a cause for extreme sadness that, despite the\never-worsening humanitarian situation in that country,\nthe international community continues to turn a blind\neye to the situation. We fear that, if the current state\nof affairs continues, a humanitarian catastrophe of epic\nproportions will unfold and haunt humankind for many\ngenerations to come. Accordingly, we wish to reiterate\nour position that punitive action in some form should\nbe taken against the Al-Assad regime for committing\ncrimes against humanity. We appeal once again to the\nSecurity Council, the organ with responsibility under\nthe Charter of the United Nations for the maintenance\nof international peace and security, to take decisive\naction, once and for all, to end the human suffering in\nSyria.\n\nLet me take this opportunity to commend all\ncredible human rights and humanitarian organizations\nfor their efforts to relieve human suffering around the\nworld. We equally wish to commend those countries in\nthe region, especially Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, for\naccommodating and positively responding to the plight\nof refugees from Syria and trying to meet their needs.\n\nThe political upheaval in Egypt is also a cause\nfor grave concern. Naturally, we believe that former\nPresident Morsi contributed to the present crisis by\nattempting to promulgate his undemocratic and divisive\nagenda, which resulted in an unfortunate military\ncoup. Urgent action is therefore required to restore\nconstitutional rule in that country.\n\nWe note with deep concern that, shortly after\ncelebrating the second anniversary of its independence,\nAfrica\u2019s newest sovereign State, South Sudan, has\nexperienced developments in its relations with the\nSudan that seriously threaten its security and territorial\nintegrity. At the same time, we remain deeply concerned\nabout the further deterioration of the political and\nhumanitarian situation in Darfur. We therefore appeal\nto the international community to assist in all ways\npossible to restore peace and stability in that region.\n\nMy Government strongly condemns the recent spate\nof terrorist attacks in Kenya, Nigeria and Pakistan,\nwhich have resulted in the loss of many innocent\nlives. We wish to convey our sincere condolences and\nsympathy to the affected countries and the families\nof the deceased. Those acts of terror are a threat to\ninternational peace and security and militate against\nthe international community\u2019s efforts to build a secure,\npeaceful and prosperous world.\n\nSuch terrorist acts are transnational in nature and\ncall therefore for a global response. To that end, we\nappeal to the conscience and resolve of all members\nof the international community to remain united and\nsteadfast, if we are to win that fight. There can be no\ndoubt that, if left unchecked, international terrorism\nhas the potential to undermine our global development\nagenda.\n\nWe find it opportune to commend Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for the vanguard role he\ncontinues to play in the maintenance of international\npeace and security, as well as in addressing issues\nof human suffering across the globe. The Secretary-\nGeneral should also be applauded for his continued\nefforts to coordinate international efforts to advance\nthe post-2015 development agenda.\n\nLet me conclude by reaffirming Botswana\u2019s\ncontinued commitment to playing its part in the quest\nfor international peace and security as well as in the\ninternational community\u2019s unrelenting efforts towards\nmaking the world a safer, peaceful and more prosperous\nplace for both present and future generations.\n"

        "file_text": "I would \nlike to begin my remarks by welcoming Mr. John Ashe \nin his capacity as President of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-eighth session. We are pleased that a \nrepresentative of our region, Latin America and the \nCaribbean, is once again presiding over the main \norgan of the United Nations. At the same time, I wish \nto express my appreciation to Mr. Vuk Jeremi. for his \noutstanding leadership and stewardship of the Assembly \nat its previous session, during which he honoured us \nwith a visit to Guatemala.\n\nThe year 2013 has been challenging for Guatemala. \nLast year we undertook to reduce our levels of child \nmalnutrition, which affects 4 of every 10 children in \nmy country. In addition, we decided that we could \nnot continue to sit on our hands while hundreds of \nthose children died of hunger. I am here to inform the \nAssembly, with some optimism, that our efforts are \nbeginning to bear fruit. Since we began the fight against \nhunger, we have managed to reduce infant mortality \nfrom malnutrition by 50 per cent. Similarly, we have \ncreated a monitoring system that allows us to measure \nthe nutritional condition of hundreds of thousands of \nchildren, both to assess their growth and development \nand to prevent deaths among children under the age \nof 5. The challenge is enormous and we know that our \ngoals are very ambitious. That is why we are not yet \nsatisfied with the progress achieved, but we can affirm \nwithout hesitation that little by little we are winning the \nfight against hunger and child malnutrition.\n\nThe fight against hunger is closely related to \neducation. We want our boys and girls to study as many \nyears as they can and wish, and with no less than nine \nyears of basic education, which is the goal we have set. \n\n\n\f\nBut for that to happen, we have to ensure that they have \nthe nutrition that will enable their brains and bodies \ngrow healthily. We have to nourish our boys and girls so \nthat they can study. And we must provide them with the \nopportunity of education so that they can be successful \nin their adult lives, both in the world of work and in the \ncivic responsibilities that our democracy needs.\n\nThat is clearly linked to our second goal, that of \npromoting dignified employment and a competitive \neconomy. I can again report to the Assembly that we \nhave achieved a 27 per cent increase in the number of \nworkers registered with Guatemala\u2019s social security \nsystem between the first quarters of 2012 and 2013. \nThat means that our economy is creating more formal \nemployment opportunities at the same time as we are \nmaking progress in establishing our country as a leader \nin improving the business climate in order to stimulate \ninvestment. \n\nI am delighted to say that we have developed a \ngrowing dialogue in various fields with the President \nof the United Mexican States, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. We \nsee the future of Guatemala as clearly related to the \neconomy of that fraternal neighbouring State, and that \nis why we have been seeking to strengthen our relations \nin areas including energy, transport and logistics, the \nmodernization of customs and the improvement of \nsecurity at border crossings, as well as our common \nbattle against hunger and in favour of peace in our \ncountries. Shared prosperity is our banner, and justice \nour emblem.\n\nIn the same vein, we have expressed to the \nGovernment of the United States of America our clear \ninterest in aligning our policies with those that promote \nprogress and security between the peoples of Mexico \nand the United States. Guatemala aspires to a tripartite \nalliance of prosperity with Mexico and the United \nStates that would serve as the foundation for solid links \nwith the countries of the Central American Integration \nSystem and at the same time become a platform for \nprogress in the entire Caribbean region.\n\nAgain, we know that these are ambitious goals and \nthat reaching them will require a strong and persistent \neffort, so as to achieve the common future of prosperity \nthat our peoples demand - a demand that we cannot \nand should not evade. Today millions of Guatemalans \nand Central Americans live and work in the United \nStates, and more than 50 per cent of our population \ndepends directly on business transactions with and \nfamily remittances from Mexico and the United States. \nThat integration is a fact, and we Governments must \nstrengthening the institutions and policies that make it \npossible to make best use of the achievements of our \nchildren, our citizens and our business community.\n\nThe quest for prosperity is also related to our goals \nof promoting peace and combating impunity. Security \nhas been a challenge inherited by my Government, and \nwe have resolved to address it by preventing violence \nand by enforcing the law in a clear framework of respect \nfor human rights. We are far from having achieved our \ngoals, but the progress made shows that our State has \nthe capacity to dismantle large criminal networks and \nto make them accountable to justice for their actions. \n\nIn that regard, I should like to inform the Assembly \nthat in urban areas of Guatemala City, where homicide, \nextortion and insecurity were prevalent, we have \nmanaged gradually to reinstate peace and social \ncoexistence. At the same time, our justice institutions \nreport that overall, impunity has been reduced by \nalmost 25 per cent between 2009 and 2013, with a \nparticular decrease in impunity for crimes against life, \nboth homicide and sexual crimes against women and \nchildren.\n\nIn connection with the strengthening of the rule of \nlaw, I would like to thank the General Assembly and \nthe donor community in particular for their support \nfor the International Commission against Impunity \nin Guatemala. Its mandate has been renewed until \nSeptember 2015, and we hope that this period will be \nused well to continue strengthening the capacity to \nprosecute of the Public Prosecutor, the Ministry of \nSecurity, the Ministry of the Interior, the national civil \npolice and the courts.\n\nBuilding a country that is prosperous and free of \nhunger, a country integrated with its neighbours and \nwhere justice and peace prevail \u2013 that is the standard \nthat will guide us, and those are the goals that will \nmove us forward. That is why we ask the international \ncommunity to support us in moving in that direction.\n\nSince my Government took office last year, we \nhave clearly affirmed that the war against drugs has \nnot yielded the desired results and that we cannot \ncontinue doing the same thing and expecting different \nresults. That is why I associate myself at this time with \nother countries that have spoken out in the Assembly, \nincluding Mexico, Colombia and Costa Rica, in stating \nthat in the face of the global drug problem, we must \nreview internationally agreed policies in the quest for \n\n\n\f\nmore effective results in a framework of respect for \nhuman rights and from the perspective of health and \nharm reduction. The objective must be the well-being \nof society in all its aspects.\n\nPrevention must be given priority in order to reduce \nthe impact on health and especially to reduce the level of \nsocial violence that is associated with the drug problem. \nIn the same vein, international cooperation should be \nstrengthened so as to reduce illegal flows of arms and \nthe funds that finance those criminal networks.\n\nThe new global strategy must emerge from an open \nand inclusive debate leading up to the special session of \nthe General Assembly scheduled for 2016. We welcome \nthe Declaration of Antigua Guatemala of the General \nAssembly of the Organization of American States as a \nfirst step in the right direction towards the 2016 session.\n\nI would like to add to this the specific views of my \nGovernment. I should first like to say that Guatemala \ncommends the visionary decision of the citizens of the \nstates of Colorado and Washington, which have led the \nway to an approach that addresses the issue of drugs \nfrom the perspective of public health, the prevention \nof addiction and violence, and full respect for human \nrights. Likewise, I wish to commend President Obama \nfor his wise decision to respect the voice of the citizens \nof Colorado and Washington, allowing those innovative \nundertakings to prove themselves over time.\n\nWe also respect and support the example set \nby President Jos\u00e9 Mujica of Uruguay in proposing \nlegislation that regulates the cannabis market instead \nof following the failed route of prohibition. I must also \nacknowledge the valiant and visionary leadership of \nthe Secretary-General of the Organization of American \nStates, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Insulza, who has firmly promoted \na climate of dialogue and reflection on drug policies \namong the Governments of the western hemisphere.\n\nWithout digressing from the path of international \ncooperation against transnational crime, each country \nmust experiment with new models to address the \ndrug problem. My Government has decided to create \na national commission that will help us explore more \neffective means of dealing with the consumption, \ntrafficking and production of drugs. \n\nWe hope that the special session of the General \nAssembly to be held in 2016 will draw on those \ninnovative experiences and take a strong stand in favour \nof public policy that can be evaluated objectively and is \nbased on a focus on public health, prevention, damage \ncontrol and, of course, respect for human rights. We \nalso believe it important that the special session be held \nhere in New York City, because of its significance for \nthe future of global policies on the drug problem.\n\nWe had the privilege of being elected to the Security \nCouncil for the period 2012-2013. Now that we are only \na few months away from the end of our tenure, I would \nlike to say that we have taken the provisions of Article \n24 of the Charter of the United Nations very seriously, \nnot only in decisions based on our own values and \nprinciples but also taking into account the fact that we \nare acting on behalf of the General Assembly. We have \nstrived to comply with our mandate with objectivity, \na sense of responsibility and professionalism, while \nemphasizing security and justice and the protection of \nhuman rights and humanitarian law.\n\nAs a non-permanent member of the Security \nCouncil, we have taken a position on the recent crisis \nin Syria. We condemned the massacre, with chemical \nweapons, of more than 1,000 people and insisted that \na crime of such magnitude could not go unpunished. \nWe also called for a firm response on the part of the \ninternational community in order to prevent any \nrepetition of such deplorable acts. Consistent with that \nposition, we have supported the leadership of President \nObama, who has clearly affirmed that peace in Syria \nand the Middle East as a whole must be built within the \nframework of a political and diplomatic dialogue, but \nwithout abandoning our international responsibility to \nprotect the citizens of those countries and of the world \nfrom the threat of nuclear and chemical weapons.\n\n\nWe also believe that the United Nations made a \nsingular contribution to humankind in 2000 when it \nlaunched the Millennium Development Goals. That is \nwhy we are actively participating in the design of the \ncontent and scope of the post-2015 development agenda \nas a catalyst for development. We particularly hope that \nthe international community will define the reduction \nof violence against women and children and universal \naccess to justice as global priorities. Only in a world that \nis free of violence against women and provides justice \nfor all can a path be cleared towards development based \non full respect for human rights.\n\nI would like to conclude my statement by \ncongratulating the United Nations system once again on \nits ongoing efforts to seek peace and justice worldwide. \nGuatemala endorses the same goals, and it is with \n\n\n\f\npride that I can affirm that we are and always will be a \ncountry guided by the principles of the Charter of the \nOrganization.\n"

        "file_text": "It is always a great \nhonour for me to address this magnificent House, \nsymbol of equality among States and an irreplaceable \nforum of multilateralism that seeks sustainable \nsolutions to the growing global challenges.\n\nI join those who spoke before us in congratulating \nyou, Mr. President, on your election to preside over the \nGeneral Assembly at this session. We believe that your \nvast experience and knowledge will contribute to the \nsuccess of our work. We would like to assure you of our \nsupport so as to ensure that your mandate is crowned \nwith success.\n\nWe also congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Vuk \nJeremi., for a job well done during the sixty-seventh \nsession, which resulted in the reaffirmation of the role \nof the United Nations as an indispensable multilateral \nforum.\n\nWe are shocked by the sad news from Kenya \nregarding the killing, in an act of terrorism, of innocent \ncitizens at a shopping mall. We would like to convey our \nsolidarity to the people and the Government of Kenya \nand to all those who lost their loved ones in the tragedy. \n\nMr. President, we commend you for your wise and \nopportune choice of the theme of this session, \u201cThe \npost-2015 development agenda: setting the stage\u201d, \nbased on the goal of creating a better world for us \nall. That agenda, like the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs), should be based on principles such \nas inclusiveness in its approach; national ownership, \nwithin the context of its sustainability; and shared \nresponsibility among development partners for its \nimplementation.\n\nThe theme of this session is the logical outcome \nof the decisions emanating from the United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development, which \ngalvanized the ongoing preparatory process for the \ndevelopment agenda that will follow the MDGs and is \nbased on a multidimensional approach to development.\n\nIn carrying out that agenda, it is important that \nwe eradicate, from both our vocabulary and our \nattitude, the dichotomy by which an attempt is made \nto group the members of the United Nations family, \nwhich is all of us, into two categories \u2014 the generous \nand the deprived \u2014 because in this partnership each \ncomplements the other with one\u2019s natural and human \nblessings. Those that do not contribute financially \ncontribute in kind.\n\nIn that context, the inability of a State to meet its \ndevelopment targets as conceived and agreed upon in \nthis great House represents a collective failure on the \npart of the entire international community, because \nsuch targets are the shared responsibility of all States. \nOtherwise, why would we set international targets that \nare later incorporated into national agendas if they are \nnot to be met?\n\nOn that basis, we reiterate our appeal for the \ncommitments made to be honoured within the context \nof the MDGs, because promises must be kept and we \nmust not fail to meet the expectations that we have \ncreated.\n\nWe would like in particular to commend the \nSecretary-General for his initiative in creating the \nHigh-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 \nDevelopment Agenda. The valuable conclusions and \nrecommendations contained in the report of the Panel \nconstitute an important reference in the formulation \n\n\n\f\nand negotiation of the development agenda that is to \nfollow the MDGs.\n\nMozambique had the privilege of being part of \nthe group of countries chosen to carry out a national \nconsultation on the post-2015 development agenda. The \ntrust shown in Mozambican civil society to drive that \nprocess must be commended because it strengthened \nthe principle of national ownership of the process. It \nalso created the conditions for Mozambican social \nactors to demonstrate their growing vitality, which is \nin itself a true reflection of the consolidation of the \nprocesses of democratic and inclusive governance in \nour country.\n\nIndeed, we have been furthering our democracy, \nreinforcing our democratic institutions and \nconsolidating our democratic practices. We do so \nthrough transparency, dialogue and participation, \ninstilling respect for the Constitution and broadening \ninclusiveness to encourage more Mozambicans to \nbecome involved in the fight against poverty. An open \nand inclusive presidency and a governance mechanism \nreplicated at other levels lead us, on the one hand, to \ninteract in a direct and comprehensive way with our \npeople in the places where they live and fight against \npoverty and, on the other hand, places our governing \nmethod under the scrutiny of the people.\n\nIt is in the context of our commitment to democratic \nprinciples and values and to abiding by the legal tenets \nof our Constitution and laws that, on 20 November, we \nwill hold municipal elections for the fourth time and, \nin 2014, our fifth general and multiparty elections. The \nimplementation of this electoral cycle is the pinnacle \nof the exercise of freedom of choice and of citizens\u2019 \npolitical participation in the democratic process.\n\nIn the context of our commitment to the \ndisarmament agenda \u2014 an issue of paramount \nimportance in promoting peace and fighting poverty \nin Mozambique \u2014 and as a way for us to associate \nourselves with the cause of international peace and \nsecurity, we will host, from 29 June to 4 July 2014, the \nThird International Review Conference of the States \nParties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, \nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel \nMines and on Their Destruction. We invite all Member \nStates, observers and international and civil society \norganizations to participate in the Conference.\n\nIn August, Mozambique successfully concluded its \nmandate as Chair of the Southern African Development \nCommunity (SADC). Given its relevance to our \ntheme, we would point out that, over the course of a \nyear and in close collaboration with other member \nStates, the Africa Union, the United Nations and other \ninternational partners, we engaged in galvanizing the \nprocess of regional integration and in seeking peace \nand stability for the region.\n\nWe reiterate our congratulations to Zimbabwe \non holding successful elections, whose results were \nvalidated by the country\u2019s institutions and endorsed \nby SADC and the African Union. All the conditions \nhave now been met for the sanctions imposed on that \ncountry to be lifted in order to allow for Zimbabwe\u2019s \ndevelopment and full participation in the global agenda. \n\nThe stability of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic \nof the Congo continues to be a challenge for our \nregion. We would like, once again, to congratulate the \nSecretary-General for his efforts \u2014 in conjunction \nwith SADC, the International Conference on the Great \nLakes Region and the African Union \u2014 which resulted \nin the signing of the Peace, Security and Cooperation \nFramework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo \nand the Region and in the appointment of President \nMary Robinson as the Special Envoy of the Secretary-\nGeneral, whom we also congratulate. We reiterate \nour appeal to all signatories to honour the tenets of \nthat agreement. We appeal to the Congolese actors to \nconclude the Kampala negotiations so as to ensure the \nreturn of lasting stability in the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of the Congo. \n\nThe establishment of dates for the presidential and \nlegislative elections this year in Madagascar creates \ngood prospects for the conclusion of the political \ntransition process in that country. We must therefore \ncontinue to provide our support to ensure that this \nprocess is successful.\n\nWithin the framework of our chairmanship of \nthe Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, \nwe remain steadfast and committed to the stability of \nGuinea-Bissau. We welcome the efforts of the Guinea-\nBissau political actors to restore stability to their \ncountry. We also commend other partners of Guinea-\nBissau \u2014 including the Economic Community of West \nAfrican States, the African Union, the European Union \nand the United Nations \u2014 which have contributed to \nthe creation of a new dynamic that seeks to find lasting \nsolutions to the political crisis. We also welcome the \nappointment of President Ramos-Horta as Special \n\n\n\f\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General and Head of \nMission for the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding \nOffice in Guinea Bissau. We reiterate our appeal to the \ninternational community to continue to mobilize the \nresources needed to fundamental elections and, above \nall, to strengthen State institutions in Guinea-Bissau.\n\nThe agenda of this session focuses on development, \nthe successful implementation of which can occur only \nin a climate of international of peace and security. In \nseeking solutions to the conflicts in different parts \nof the world, the multilateral approach, based on the \nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, must \nprevail. Safeguarding world peace will always be our \ncollective responsibility and never that of one country \nor of group of States. In that context, the reform of the \nUnited Nations, particularly of the Security Council, \nmust continue to receive our special attention so as to \nensure that that organ is more representative, democratic \nand credible and that it can respond more effectively to \nthe various challenges of the contemporary world.\n\nIt will always be a paradox that whenever social, \nenvironmental and economic issues arise, all countries \nunderstand that multilateral cooperation is a mechanism \nthat cannot be avoided, but that decisions involving \npeace or war tend to be made behind closed doors by a \nsmall group of States. At a time in which concepts such \nas democracy, inclusion, ownership and transparency \nenjoy renewed prominence, we must all accept that \nthe time has come to balance the imbalances that are \ncontrary to multilateralism. \n\nIt is in the context of this overall framework that \nthe Republic of Mozambique maintains its support for \nthe self-determination of the Palestinian people, the \nexistence of a Palestinian State based on the relevant \nUnited Nations resolutions and the two-State solution \nin which Palestine and Israel live side by side and in \nan environment of peace and security. We further \nsupport the self-determination of the Saharawi people. \nMoreover, the Republic of Mozambique reaffirms the \nneed to end economic trade and financial embargos \nagainst Cuba. \n\nOnce again, we reiterate our commitment to the \nnoble ideals of the United Nations and reaffirm that we \nwill continue to do our part in building an increasingly \nbetter, more stable and prosperous world.\n"

        "file_text": "Today, I \naddress the Assembly at a time when I feel great \nuncertainty about the future of the Organization and \nthe established rules governing the relations among \nits Member States. It was expected that yesterday the \nAssembly would hear, from this rostrum, a statement \nfrom President Al-Bashir, the elected President of the \nRepublic of the Sudan. However, with deep regret I \nmust report the refusal by the authorities of the United \nStates, the host Government, to give entry visas to \nPresident Al-Bashir and his delegation, thus rendering \nhim unable to participate in the work of the Assembly \nat this session. \n\nThe fact that the authorities of the host country did \nnot grant a visa to our President is a serious violation \nof the principles and purposes set forth in the Charter \nof the United Nations. Specifically, it is a violation of \nthe Headquarters Agreement signed in December 1946 \nwith the host country. \n\nPresident Al-Bashir is known throughout Africa. \nHe is known by all those who hold peace dear. He is \nknown by everybody for what he has done \u2014 putting \nan end to the longest bloodthirsty civil war in Africa, \ninherited from the days of colonialism. The birth \nof the Republic of South Sudan is clear proof of his \ncommitment to the implementation of the provisions of \nthe Comprehensive Peace Agreement. \n\nDespite the tremendous sacrifice made by giving \nup a valuable part of the territory, one rich in natural \nand human resources, President Al-Bashir has been \nprevented from participating in the work of the General \nAssembly. However, the meeting of the Peace and \nSecurity Council of the African Union has highlighted \nthe part that he has played in supporting peace between \nthe Sudan and South Sudan and throughout our region.\n\n\n\f\nMy delegation would like to say that this unjustified \nand unacceptable action sets a very serious precedent \nin the history of the United Nations. It requires that the \nwhole membership take a firm position on this matter. \nThis denial of the legitimate right of a Member State \nleads us to call on the Secretary-General to exercise his \nduty and responsibility to protect the rights of Member \nStates under the Headquarters Agreement. If the matter \nwere left up to the Sudan, then the same kind of thing \ncould happen to any other Member State, and we would \nnot like those rights to be violated. \n\nI should like to warmly congratulate the President on \nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-eighth session. I take this opportunity to \nextend my country\u2019s thanks to his predecessor, Mr. Vuk \nJeremi., for the excellent manner in which he guided \nthe work at the last session. We also thank Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon and his team in the Secretariat \nfor the sincere and diligent work that they have done \nfor us.\n\nIt is our hope that discussions during this session \nwill be successful. The theme chosen, \u201cThe post-\n2015 development agenda: setting the stage\u201d, is \nimportant. The Sudan believes that the Organization \nand its specialized agencies will indeed devote the \nimportance that is appropriate to such a crucial issue \nbecause development is essential to international peace \nand security, particularly in developing countries. As \neveryone knows, poverty, underdevelopment, climate \nchange and a shortage of resources are some of the \nmain causes of conflict in the world.\n\nThe Sudan has made great strategic progress \nregarding peace, stability and prosperity for its people \nand has begun a political process that will lead to the \nadoption of a final constitution. After the peace efforts \nproved successful vis-\u00e0-vis the independence of South \nSudan, we accepted the choice of its people. Today \nwe are working to develop a solid economic system, \neven though we have to deal with the after-effects of \neconomic sanctions that the United States unilaterally \nimposed on us. We have begun to take economic steps \nnecessary to strengthen our economy and prevent it \nfrom collapsing. \n\nOn the matter of human rights, I should like to share \nthe opinion expressed by the Special Rapporteur on the \nSudan. He recognized that progress had been made in \nvarious areas of human rights. These matters have been \ndealt with very seriously, and the recommendations \nwill be dealt with in our policy. We are committed to \nthe principles of human rights, and we have set up an \nindependent national human rights commission in the \nSudan, founded in accordance with the Paris principles, \nthat cooperates with the relevant United Nations \nagencies.\n\nTo promote and strengthen human rights, we \nsigned a national law to combat trafficking in human \nbeings. We have many specialized institutions and \nmechanisms that work to defend women\u2019s rights \nas well, so that women can participate fully in our \nsociety and in our State. That can be seen very clearly \nin the positive discrimination we have been pursuing \nvis-\u00e0-vis women, which has led to greater political \nparticipation by women at the legislative, executive and \nother decision-making levels.\n\nIn 2010 we adopted a law on the rights of the \nchild that is in accordance with the principles of the \nConvention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional \nProtocols, so that we can promote the rights of \nchildren and protect them against any kind of violence \nor exploitation. Our various national institutions \ncoordinate among themselves, and we have set up a \nnational board for children. We have police who deal \nespecially with the issues of youth and children, and we \nhave a public prosecutor who specializes in this area.\n\nOnce South Sudan was established, we immediately \nbegan to engage in neighbourly and fruitful cooperation \nwith it. We have blood ties with it and a common border \nmore than 2,100 kilometres long. About two thirds of \nthe inhabitants of both countries live along the borders. \n\nThe period following the independence of South \nSudan was a period of some tension because of \ncertain matters that had been left pending, so the two \ncountries entered into very intensive negotiations. On \n27 September 2012, exactly one year ago, in Addis Ababa \nthe two countries were able to sign nine agreements \ncovering all matters of cooperation between our two \ncountries. We included mechanisms for implementing \nthe agreements in an accompanying document. We also \nset forth deadlines for reaching further agreements. \n\nAt the most recent negotiating session between the \ntwo Presidents, in Khartoum on 3 September, and in \nthe presence of Mr. Mbeki, the two Presidents came to \nan agreement on how to deal with all pending matters. \nThey also appealed to the international community \nto cancel the Sudan\u2019s debt and to lift the sanctions \nimposed on it. \n\n\n\f\nTurning now to the matter of unilateral sanctions, \nit is our hope that we will have strong and healthy \nrelations with South Sudan, and we will spare no effort \nto achieve that. We trust the international community \nwill be supportive of our efforts. We would like to \nextend our thanks to the African high-level mechanism \nand the Prime Minister of Ethiopia in this connection. \n\nI am happy to be able to report that the efforts of \nthe Government of the Sudan and the international \ncommunity vis-\u00e0-vis Darfur have made possible real \nand continuous progress in terms of stability and \nsecurity. There has been a sharp drop in the violence \nthere because those that signed the Doha peace \nagreement have lived up to their promises. Many of the \narmed groups joined the agreement later. The voluntary \nreturn of people who had left is also being organized \nand services are being provided.\n\nI should like to say that relations between the \nGovernment of the Sudan and United Nations bodies \nwith regard to the humanitarian situation are now stable, \nso that humanitarian needs can be met. We reached \nan agreement with UNICEF on vaccinations against \npoliomyelitis and other diseases, and an agreement was \nreached as part of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.\n\nRegarding non-governmental organizations, the \nSudan, like other Member States, is committed to the \nimplementation of the development goals, including \ncombating poverty. We have adopted policies on \nreducing poverty and on providing more jobs for young \ngraduates. We are also developing a microfinance system \nfor low- and middle-income people. Unfortunately, \nhowever, unemployment is not as low as we had hoped, \nand the unilateral economic sanctions have been a real \nobstacle to our making progress in development and \nin strengthening our economy. It has been particularly \ndifficult for young people in the Sudan, who account \nfor about 60 per cent of our population. \n\nThe Sudan calls on the international community \nto live up to its promise to cancel the debt and to lift \nunilateral economic sanctions. The matter of the debt is \none of the important goals of the post-2015 development \nagenda. Debt is a real burden for so many countries in \nthe world.\n\nThe Sudan is a prominent member of many \ninternational bodies dealing with the environment. As a \nvictim of climate change, the Sudan believes that great \nattention should be paid to environmental issues and \ngoals in the post-2015 development agenda. We would \nlike to work with others through the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change.\n\nThe situation is deteriorating every year. We have \nsuffered from climate change since the mid-1980s. \nWe have suffered from recurrent cycles of drought in \nmuch of our territory, and that has also been a factor \nin slowing down our development goals. It has also \ncreated instability in many parts of our country because \nof conflict over pasture land and water supplies. That \napplies also in Darfur, where historically there have \nbeen tribal disputes and disputes over pastureland \nbecause of long periods of drought. The Darfur \nconflict became a political issue only in the last decade \nbecause of external interference. There is a very close \nrelationship between climate change and armed conflict \nin that respect.\n\nMy country attaches paramount importance to the \nrule of law at the national and international levels. We \nmake sure that our national laws and our legislature are \nin accordance with international instruments, laws and \ntreaties to which we are a party. So from this rostrum, \nand based on our own experience, we reiterate our \nrejection of the International Criminal Court (ICC). \nOver the past decade or so it has been violating the \nprinciples of international law and justice. The ICC \nhas been used as a political tool by certain parties in \nthe international arena. Many of those that signed the \nRome Statute have now become aware of the negative \nimpact of the ICC and its destructive impact on stability \nand peace. The last African Union Summit showed that \nvery clearly.\n\nRegarding the crisis in Syria, our position has \nalways been clear. We call for peaceful dialogue among \nthe Syrians themselves towards identifying a peaceful \nand permanent solution. We have always rejected \nviolence and foreign interference. We condemn the use \nof chemical weapons in the Syrian conflict, and we \nsupport the Russian approach to resolving this matter.\n\nThe question of Palestine \u2014 how to achieve justice \nand restore the rights of the Palestinian people and stop \nthe illegal aggression by the Israeli authorities in that \nterritory \u2014 is still a real challenge in the international \narena. The prisoners must be released. The matter \nmust be resolved within the context of international \nlegitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative, but Israel has \nsimply turned a deaf ear to proposals from the Arab \nsides. \n\n\n\f\nThere has been a constant call for respect for \ninternational law. The reform of the United Nations \nand its principal and subsidiary organs is a matter of \nsome urgency and importance. It is time for a practical \nprocess to start, with a clear work programme, so that \nthe international system can act in a manner that is \nfair, transparent and effective, so that it can take up \nthe challenges it faces. But no progress will be made in \nreform until the General Assembly can play its full part \nand exercise all of its powers without any intimidation \nfrom the Security Council. \n\nThe matter of reform of the Security Council \nis also of some importance for the Sudan, because \nthat will mean that there is real reform in the United \nNations. The Security Council today does not reflect \nthe realities of the world. It adopts resolutions and takes \ndecisions but not in a democratic and transparent way. \nIt is therefore essential that there be comprehensive \nreform. Partial or transitional reforms are not possible. \nWe support the African Union position on reform of the \ninternational system. We want a balanced, pluralistic \nand fairer system that will be able to deal with the \nchallenges of the world of today, ensure respect for \ninternational law and for the noble principles of the \nOrganization and attain the purposes and principles of \nthe Charter \u2014 respect for the sovereignty of States and \nnon-interference in domestic issues under any pretext \nwhatsoever; the non-use of force; and the non-use of the \nthreat of force against others.\n"

I would like also to express our appreciation \nto His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi., President of the \nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session, for his efforts \nfor the success of that session. I would like also to \ncommend the efforts of His Excellency the Secretary-\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, to strengthen the role of the \nUnited Nations.\n\nThe international community faces many different \nproblems related to peace and security, in addition to \nchallenges facing the efforts made to solve disputes \npeacefully. This calls for strengthening the United \nNations capacity to tackle these challenges and \nproblems.\n\nPeoples from different regions of the world are \nexpecting the institutions of the international community \nto dedicate their efforts to finding solutions to the issues \nof poverty, hunger and sustainable development in a way \nthat goes beyond simply convening conferences and \nadopting resolutions, and even beyond the necessary \ncollective attention and campaigns that are called for \nfrom time to time, important as they might be.\n\nRecently, the Arab region has experienced many \nhistoric events and accelerating change. It has witnessed \nturbulent events arising from popular movements and \ntheir forceful entry into the public and political arenas.\n\nStalemate continues to characterize the Arab-\nIsraeli conflict. That conflict is at the forefront of the \nissues threatening international peace and security, \nowing to the continued Israeli occupation and the \ninjustices inflicted upon the Palestinian people, as \nwell as the failure to reach a just and lasting peace in \naccordance with resolutions of international legality. \nThe continued Israeli occupation of Palestinian and \nArab territories cannot be accepted as normal. Its \npractices include the changing of the demographic \nconditions in those territories, particularly through the \nexpansion of settlement activity, the Judaization of the \ncity of Jerusalem, the unjust embargo against the Gaza \nStrip, and intensification of settlement activities in the \noccupied Syrian Golan and changing its status quo and \ndemographics. This is not simply because such actions \nrepresent flagrant violations of international laws and \ncovenants, but also because the Palestinian cause is a \njust cause and the historical injustice inflicted upon the \nPalestinian people must end.\n\nThe major international bodies were established \non the basis of the right to self-determination in the \naftermath of two world wars. It is unreasonable that \nthey cannot do anything about the last remaining \ncolonial issue in the world. \n\nIsrael should realize that coercion and de facto \npolicies do not bring security. It is wrong for it to \nestablish a State that believes that the prospect for \npeace lies in subjugating other peoples, denying their \nrights and making that a priority over peace. \n\nThere can be no security without peace. True \npeace can come about only through coexistence among \npeoples on the basis of good-neighbourliness, mutual \nrespect and respect for the interests of all. The peace we \ndesire is built upon dignity, justice and the principles \nof international legality, as well as United Nations \nresolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative, the principle \nof a two-State solution and the withdrawal of Israel \n\n\n\f\nfrom all occupied Arab territories. The experiences \nof different nations and peoples confirm that unjust \nsettlements do not endure but only lead to new conflicts.\n\nThe continued de facto policy in Palestine will not \nmake the issue disappear. It is actually becoming more \ncomplicated, because continuing settlement activities \nare leading to the destruction of the foundation for \nthe establishment of a Palestinian State. The current \nstatus quo resembles a situation of apartheid under the \ndomination of one State or even within a single State. \nThat cannot but be grounds for fresh conflict, as no \npeople could accept continued injustice and remain \nsilent.\n\nThe inalienable national rights of the Palestinian \npeople to establish their independent State, with \nJerusalem as its capital and within the limits of 1967 \nborders, as well as the right of return for Palestinian \nrefugees, are not only an Arab demand; they also \nrepresent an international standard for testing the \ncredibility of international legality, which should not \nbe divisible. Just as the international community has in \nthe past applied the principles of international legality \nto other crises in the world, we should apply the same \nlegal principles to all issues. We therefore call upon \nthe Security Council to uphold its responsibility to \nmaintain international peace and security and to take \nthe decisions necessary to stop all illegitimate Israeli \npractices.\n\nDestructive actions and appalling massacres, \nincluding the policy of scorched earth and the \ndestruction of cities, continue to be carried out by the \nSyrian regime against its peoples, crossing all red lines \ndictated by ethics and mandated by law, particularly in \nview of the regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons against \nthe Syrian people.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the perpetrators of those \nbrutal crimes and massacres, which have shocked every \nhuman conscience, are, undeterred, enjoying impunity \nfrom accountability. That raises questions about the \ncredibility of the human rights and international legality \nmechanisms of the international community.\n\nThe issue is not whether or not Syria possesses \nchemical weapons, because Syria is a State that is in \nconflict with another State that possesses chemical, \nbiological and even nuclear weapons. The issue is the \nuse of such weapons by the regime against its own \npeople. The Syrian people did not rise up in order to \nplace Syrian chemical weapons under international \nsupervision. They did so in order to get rid of despotism \nand corruption and to put an end to the injustice they \nhave been facing.\n\nWe all know that the responsibility for the failure \nto impose the political settlement we would all prefer \nfor Syria is due basically to the Security Council\u2019s \ninability to take the decisions required to put an end \nto the bloodshed and to the continued intransigence of \nthe Syrian regime and its rejection of all regional and \ninternational initiatives.\n\nFrom that perspective, the decision-making process \nin the Security Council must change, since it lacks \nfairness and objectivity. It has also become a major \nobstacle to the maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity and to the punishment of war criminals and \nperpetrators of crimes against humanity. We therefore \nreiterate the importance of accelerating comprehensive \nreform of the Security Council in order to make it more \ncapable of dealing objectively with global challenges \nand responding to the aspirations of peoples. That can \nbe achieved only through equitable representation of \nthe international community in the Council, so that it \ncan become expressive of democracy in international \nmultilateral efforts. \n\nWhile it is obviously impossible for any decision \nto be taken in the Council without the support \nof the majority of the permanent member States, \ndecision-making should not be monopolized in the long \nterm by one or two States.\n\nI take this opportunity to call upon our Syrian \nbrothers to unify their ranks in order to initiate a \ntransitional period leading to the establishment of \na governing system that guarantees freedom and \ndignity for all Syrians, without discrimination on the \ngrounds of gender, nationality, sect or creed. These \nlarge numbers of martyrs have not fallen and all these \nsacrifices have not been made by this great people so \nthat despotism could be exchanged for chaos or another \nkind of despotism. \n\nThe Arab Spring revolutions, during which the \nArab people have risen up, calling for freedom, dignity \nand social justice, are now facing difficulties that seem \nto be aimed at reversing the march of time. As such \ndifficulties had been anticipated, it is strange that \ncertain politicians have not been able to avoid even \nexpected problems.\n\nAnyone who knows the reality of the issues in the \nArab region and their historical context knows that these \n\n\n\f\nrevolutions have taken place in the context of a long-\nterm historical process similar to those experienced \npreviously by various peoples in Europe, America, Asia \nand Africa. The path to a just rule and to meeting the \ndemands of peoples in all States of the world has never \nbeen easy; it has always been replete with sacrifices. \nIt is not easy to follow such a path with patience and \ndetermination. Rarely have there been revolutions that \nhave not been followed by desperate attempts by former \nregimes to abort them. That is why wise people always \nprefer that regime change should take place through a \nprocess of gradual reform. \n\nBut we also know very well that in some cases, in \nour region and in other regions of the world, change \ncould not have taken place through reform. We should \nnot jump to hasty conclusions about the future of the \nArab revolutions. This is a historical necessity and a \nlong-term one. It is clear that things in the Arab world \nwill not revert to the way they were and that the Arab \npeoples have become more aware of their rights and \nmore involved in the public domain.\n\nThe State of Qatar has always opted to be an active \nand effective party playing a constructive role at the \ninternational level through its balanced economic \nand political relations at the bilateral and multilateral \nlevels. We will continue to take that approach, so that \nthe State of Qatar can uphold its responsibilities and \ncommitments at the national, regional and international \nlevels. The State of Qatar aims to be a hub for dialogue \nand discussion among various parties to conflicts and \nnot to be a party to such conflicts. We aim also to create \nopportunities for cultural and informational dialogue \nbetween peoples.\n\nIn that context, the process of reform and \nmodernity initiated by Qatar, which has made it a State \nof institutions and one that is interacting positively \nwith the international community, was achieved \nonly through a genuine commitment to applying \nthe rule of law and principles of good governance, \ncombating corruption, protecting human rights and \nbasic freedoms, empowering women to participate in \npublic life on an equal footing with men, and creating \na healthy environment for children. In addition, our \nnational policies have always focused, as a priority, on \nthe concerns of young people and on creating a suitable \neducational environment for them aimed at ensuring \nthe maximum use of their capacities. \n\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \nin particular nuclear weapons, in the Middle East is \na very alarming issue. In that context, I affirm the \nposition of the State of Qatar that every State in the \nregion has an absolute right to use nuclear power for \npeaceful purposes in accordance with the standards \nand procedures of the International Atomic Energy \nAgency. We also look forward to convening the Helsinki \nconference as a step that contributes to the efforts \naimed at making the Middle East a zone free of nuclear \nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe issue of climate change remains at the top of \nour concerns, with all its ramifications for the global \nsystem as a whole. In that regard, I would like to \nconfirm and reiterate the commitment of the State of \nQatar to continued cooperation with the international \ncommunity in facing that challenge and implementing \nthe measures agreed upon during the eighteenth \nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \nwhich was hosted by Qatar at the end of last year, in \norder to develop a road map for tackling the negative \nenvironmental and economic consequences of that \ndangerous phenomenon.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the State of Qatar has \ngone a long way towards implementing the initiative \nof the Global Dry Land Alliance, which it launched \nin order to establish an international organization that \nwould tackle the implications of that phenomenon. \nThat proposed organization will complement the work \nof the other relevant international organizations in \ncombatting desertification and drought and preserving \nthe environment without duplicating their work. I call \nupon all Member States to support that initiative.\n\nThe State of Qatar participates as an active and \neffective partner in efforts to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment at the international level. We have pledged \nto allocate the required percentage of our gross national \nproduct for the least developed countries, in addition \nto the humanitarian and relief assistance that our State \nprovides in cases of emergency and disaster.\n\nIn that context, the State of Qatar has achieved the \nmajority of the Millennium Development Goals and is \nworking towards achieving all the Goals before 2015, as \ndemonstrated by United Nations and regional reports in \nthat field.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour and a privilege \nfor me to once again address this body. South Africa \nattaches the utmost importance to the General Assembly \nas the most representative and democratic organ of the \nUnited Nations serving the international community.\n\n\n\f\nWe congratulate President Ashe and the Republic of \nAntigua and Barbuda on his election as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. We also \nthank Mr. Vuk Jeremi. for the splendid way in which he \npresided over the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.\n\nLet me begin by reiterating our condemnation of \nthe horrific terrorist attack over the weekend in Kenya, \nin which a number of civilians, including a South \nAfrican national, were killed. We express our deepest \ncondolences to the Government and people of Kenya \nand to all those families who lost loved ones, and wish \nthe wounded survivors a speedy recovery. We continue \nto support the efforts of Kenya and the international \ncommunity aimed at peacekeeping, stability, democracy \nand nation-building in Somalia.\n\nThe theme for our debate this year, \u201cThe post-\n2015 development agenda: setting the stage\u201d, is most \nappropriate. In the year 2000, the commitment was \nmade by world leaders in the Millennium Declaration \nto eradicate extreme poverty and adopt the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). The MDGs are measurable \nand achievable targets that were specifically crafted to \naddress the most pressing development needs of the \nmost vulnerable countries. The full implementation of \nthe MDGs remains the key priority on the development \nagenda for the next two years.\n\nA development agenda for beyond 2015 should \nallow individual regions and States the space to \naddress the development needs peculiar to their \ncircumstances and priorities. For Africa in particular, \nthe future development agenda should address poverty \neradication, income inequality and job creation. We \nfurthermore believe that the new development agenda \ncan be effective only if it is focused on all three \ndimensions of sustainable development, namely, the \neradication of poverty through economic development, \nsocial development and environmental sustainability.\n\nWe also wish to emphasize that any development \nagenda beyond 2015 must be based on the principle \nof common but differentiated responsibilities in \norder to equalize the international playing field. We \nraise this point out of our concern that the global \neconomic meltdown seems to have brought about new \ndevelopments that are detrimental to the developing \nworld, especially Africa. Some of the new developments \ninclude the tendency to renegotiate the rules of the \ngame. New issues are being introduced as prerequisites \nfor development and partnerships and have, in fact, \nbecome huge non-tariff barriers. They include the green \neconomy and clean technology. While those issues are \nimportant for Africa and developing countries and need \nto be attended to, the manner in which they have been \ncrafted restrains economic development, as they are \nused as obstacles.\n\nWe also wish to emphasize our expectations that the \ndeveloped North and developing South will continue \nto engage in a genuine partnership. In that regard, \nthe developed North countries should stand ready to \nmeet their commitment to contribute 0.7 per cent of \ntheir gross national income to official development \nassistance.\n\nWe are aware of the challenges in the North caused \nby the economic meltdown, but we are of the view that \ninvesting in development in the South, especially in \nAfrica, is of primary importance as a source of much-\nneeded sustainable development and stability in the \nworld. Attempts to delegate some of those historical \nresponsibilities to new emerging economies in the South \nare unacceptable and unworkable, as such emerging \nnations have their own historical challenges and \nbacklogs to deal with. Furthermore, any commitment \nwe make to the future beyond 2015 must build on \nexisting agreements, which include Agenda 21, the \nMDGs, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and \nthe outcome document of the Rio de Janeiro Conference \non Sustainable Development. In the case of Africa, \nthey must build on the New Partnership for Africa\u2019s \nDevelopment.\n\nDevelopment and security are two sides of the \nsame coin. The best way to ensure both is through good \ngovernance and the promotion of democratic values in \nall societies. Allow me, therefore, to register once again \nour serious concern that the Security Council, almost \n70 years since its establishment, remains undemocratic, \nunrepresentative and unfair to developing nations and \nsmall States, and disenfranchises the majority of the \nStates Members of the United Nations, which form the \nmajority in the General Assembly. We cannot remain \nbeholden indefinitely to the will of an unrepresentative \nminority on the most important issues of international \npeace and security.\n\nThere has been too much talk about the need for \nreform, with too little action. We would like to challenge \nthe Assembly today by saying \u201cLet us set ourselves the \ntarget to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the \nUnited Nations in 2015 with a reformed, more inclusive, \ndemocratic and representative Security Council!\u201d.\n\n\n\f\nWhen discussing the Security Council, the matter \nof the Syrian Arab Republic comes into focus. We have \nexpressed our dismay at the use of chemical weapons \nin Syria. There is no cause that could justify the use \nof weapons of mass destruction by anyone under any \ncircumstances. It is, however, our strongly held view \nthat any political transition in Syria must come about as \na result of the will of the Syrian people and not through \nthe force of arms.\n\nWe welcome the recent positive developments, \nsuch as the decision by Syria to accede to the Chemical \nWeapons Convention and the ongoing bilateral \nconsultations between the Russian Federation and \nthe United States. We support all of the diplomatic \nefforts aimed at finding a solution to this matter. The \ninternational community has an opportunity to use the \nSyrian experience to ensure that matters of this nature \nare handled correctly going forward, using existing \ninstruments within the multilateral system of global \ngovernance.\n\nNext year South Africa will celebrate its twentieth \nanniversary of freedom and democracy. We will forever \nbe grateful to those in the international community, \nincluding the United Nations, who stood beside us in \nour long struggle for liberation. We look forward to \ncelebrating our anniversary of freedom with the United \nNations and to strengthening our partnership. A strong \npartnership with the United Nations is critical for the \nfuture we want for the people of South Africa. \n\nWe also take this opportunity to thank the United \nNations and the international community for their \nsupport during the recent hospitalization of our beloved \nfounding President of the free and democratic South \nAfrica, His Excellency Mr. Nelson Mandela. We thank \nthem for all for their support and good wishes. The \nUnited Nations declared 18 July, his birthday, as Nelson \nMandela International Day. That has become a catalyst \npromoting service to humankind worldwide. We \nthank the United Nations for that gesture. Our revered \nformer President continues to respond to treatment \nat his home. His family and our people have warmly \nwelcomed the support he continues to receive from the \nglobal community. We are humbled and very grateful \nfor that support.\n\nAs we celebrate our freedom and democracy, we \nremain mindful that our struggle is not complete until \nthe people of Palestine and Western Sahara enjoy \ntheir rights to self-determination. Just as the United \nNations stood by South Africa, we would like to see the \nOrganization be at the forefront of efforts towards self-\ndetermination for the peoples of Palestine and Western \nSahara.\n\nWe are deeply concerned about continued illegal \nsettlement activities in the West Bank in violation of \ninternational law. Such illegal settlement activities \njeopardize the realization of the two-State solution.\n\nThe Cuban people also hold a special place in our \nhearts because of that country\u2019s sacrifice for African \npeoples in their quest for freedom. We will therefore \ncontinue to struggle with them for their economic \nliberation.\n\nAt its sixty-eighth session the General Assembly \nwill undertake critical work for the future of our people. \nLet us tackle the work ahead in such a manner that when \nfuture generations look back on this moment, they will \nbe able to say that the leaders of this generation laid the \nfoundation for the eradication of poverty, for building a \nglobal society of equality, and for world peace.\n\nLet me borrow from the words of our former \nPresident Nelson Mandela on his inauguration day in \n1994 when he said:\n\n\u201cWe understand it still that there is no easy \nroad to freedom. We know it well that none of \nus acting alone can achieve success. We must \ntherefore act together as a united people, for \nnational reconciliation, for nation-building, for the \nbirth of a new world. Let there be justice for all. \nLet there be peace for all. Let there be work, bread, \nwater and salt for all. Let each know that for each \nthe body, the mind and the soul have been freed to \nfulfil themselves.\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "Each year we come together to \nreaffirm the founding vision of this institution. For most \nof recorded history, individual aspirations were subject \nto the whims of tyrants and empires, and divisions of \nrace, religion and tribe were settled through the sword \nand the clash of armies. \n\nThe idea that nations and peoples could come \ntogether in peace to solve their disputes and advance a \ncommon prosperity seemed unimaginable. It took the \nawful carnage of two world wars to shift our thinking. \nThe leaders who built the United Nations were not naive. \nThey did not think that this body could eradicate all \nwars. But in the wake of millions dead and continents \nin rubble and with the development of nuclear weapons \nthat could annihilate a planet, they understood that \nhumanity could not survive the course it was on. They \ngave us this institution, believing that it could allow \nus to resolve conflicts, enforce rules of behaviour and \nbuild habits of cooperation that would grow stronger \nover time.\n\nFor decades, the United Nations has in fact made \na difference, from helping to eradicate disease to \n\n\n\f\neducating children and brokering peace. But like \nevery generation of leaders, we face new and profound \nchallenges, and this body continues to be tested. The \nquestion is whether we possess the wisdom and the \ncourage as nation States and members of an international \ncommunity to squarely meet those challenges. Can the \nUnited Nations meet the test of our time?\n\nAnd for much of my tenure as President, some of \nour most urgent challenges have revolved around an \nincreasingly integrated global economy and our efforts \nto recover from the worst economic crisis of our lifetime. \nNow, five years after the global economy collapsed and \nthanks to coordinated efforts by the countries here \ntoday, jobs are being created, global financial systems \nhave stabilized and people are once again being lifted \nout of poverty. But this progress is fragile and unequal, \nand we still have work to do together to assure that our \ncitizens can access the opportunities that they need in \norder to thrive in the twenty-first century.\n\nTogether, we have also worked to end a decade of \nwar. Five years ago nearly 180,000 Americans were \nserving in harm\u2019s way, and the war in Iraq was the \ndominant issue in our relationship with the rest of the \nworld. Today, all of our troops have left Iraq. Next year an \ninternational coalition will end its war in Afghanistan, \nhaving achieved its mission of dismantling the core of \nAl Qaida that attacked us on 9/11.\n\nFor the United States, those new circumstances \nhave also meant shifting away from a perpetual war \nfooting. Beyond bringing our troops home we have \nlimited the use of drones so that they target only those \nwho pose a continuing imminent threat to the United \nStates, when capture is not feasible and when there \nis a near certainty of no civilian casualties. We are \ntransferring detainees to other countries and trying \nterrorists in courts of law, while working diligently to \nclose the prison at Guantanamo Bay. Just as we have \nreviewed how we deploy our extraordinary military \ncapabilities in a way that lives up to our ideals, we have \nbegun to review the way that we gather intelligence, \nso that we properly balance the legitimate security \nconcerns of our citizens and allies with the privacy \nconcerns that all people share.\n\nAs a result of such work and cooperation with \nallies and partners, the world is more stable than it was \nfive years ago. But even a glance at today\u2019s headlines \nindicates that dangers remain. In Kenya, we have \nseen terrorists target innocent civilians in a crowded \nshopping mall. Our hearts go out to the families of \nthose who have been affected. In Pakistan, nearly 100 \npeople were recently killed by suicide bombers outside \na church. In Iraq, killings and car bombs continue to be \na terrible part of life.\n\nMeanwhile, Al-Qaida has splintered into regional \nnetworks and militias, which does not give them the \ncapacity at this point to carry out attacks like 9/11 \nbut does pose serious threats to Governments and \ndiplomats, businesses and civilians all across the globe. \nJust as significantly, the convulsions in the Middle East \nand North Africa have laid bare deep divisions within \nsocieties, as an old order is upended and people grapple \nwith what is coming next. Peaceful movements have too \noften been answered by violence from those resisting \nchange and from extremists trying to hijack change. \nSectarian conflict has re-emerged, and the potential \nspread of weapons of mass destruction continues to cast \na shadow over the pursuit of peace.\n\nNowhere have we seen those trends converge \nmore powerfully than in Syria. There, peaceful \nprotests against an authoritarian regime were met with \nrepression and slaughter. In the face of such carnage, \nmany retreated to their sectarian identities \u2014 Alawite \nand Sunni, Christian and Kurd \u2014 and the situation \nspiralled into civil war.\n\nThe international community recognized the stakes \nearly on, but our response has not matched the scale of \nthe challenge. Aid cannot keep pace with the suffering \nof the wounded and displaced. A peace process is \nstillborn. America and others have worked to bolster \nthe moderate opposition, but extremist groups have still \ntaken root to exploit the crisis.\n\nAl-Assad\u2019s traditional allies have propped him up, \nciting principles of sovereignty to shield his regime. \nOn 21 August, the regime used chemical weapons in \nan attack that killed more than 1,000 people, including \nhundreds of children. Today, the crisis in Syria and the \ndestabilization of the region goes to the heart of broader \nchallenges that the international community must now \nconfront. How should we respond to conflicts in the \nMiddle East and North Africa \u2014 conflicts between \ncountries, but also conflicts within them? How do we \naddress the choice between standing callously by while \nchildren are subjected to nerve gas and embroiling \nourselves in someone else\u2019s civil war? What is the role of \nforce in resolving disputes that threaten the stability of \na region and undermine all basic standards of civilized \nconduct? And what is the role of the United Nations and \ninternational law in meeting cries for justice?\n\n\n\f\nToday, I want to outline where the United States of \nAmerica stands on those issues.\n\nWith respect to Syria, we believe that, as a starting \npoint, the international community must enforce the ban \non chemical weapons. When I stated my willingness to \norder a limited strike against the Al-Assad regime in \nresponse to its brazen use of chemical weapons, I did \nnot do so lightly. I did so because I believe that it is \nin the national security interests of the United States \nand in the interest of the world to meaningfully enforce \na prohibition whose origins are older than the United \nNations itself. The ban against the use of chemical \nweapons, even in war, has been agreed to by 98 percent \nof humanity. It is strengthened by the searing memories \nof soldiers suffocated in the trenches, Jews slaughtered \nin gas chambers, Iranians poisoned in the many tens of \nthousands.\n\nThe evidence is overwhelming that the Al-Assad \nregime used such weapons on 21 August. United \nNations inspectors gave a clear accounting of their \nfindings that advanced rockets had fired large \nquantities of sarin gas at civilians. Those rockets were \nfired from a regime-controlled neighbourhood and \nlanded in opposition neighbourhoods. It is an insult to \nhuman reason and to the legitimacy of this institution \nto suggest that anyone other than the regime carried out \nthis attack.\n\nI know that in the immediate aftermath of the attack \nthere were those who questioned the legitimacy of even \na limited strike in the absence of a clear mandate from \nthe Security Council. But without a credible military \nthreat, the Security Council had demonstrated no \ninclination to act at all. However, as I have discussed \nwith President Putin for over a year, most recently in \nSt. Petersburg, my preference has always been to work \nfor a diplomatic resolution to this issue, and in the past \nseveral weeks, the United States, Russia and our allies \nhave reached an agreement to place Syria\u2019s chemical \nweapons under international control and then destroy \nthem.\n\nThe Syrian Government took a first step by giving \nan accounting of its stockpiles. Now, there must be a \nstrong Security Council resolution to verify that the \nAl-Assad regime is keeping its commitments, and there \nmust be consequences if they fail to do so. If we cannot \nagree even on that, then that will show that the United \nNations is incapable of enforcing the most basic of \ninternational laws. On the other hand, if we succeed, it \nwill send a powerful message that the use of chemical \nweapons has no place in the twenty-first century and \nthat this Organization means what it says.\n\nOur agreement on chemical weapons should \nenergize a larger diplomatic effort to reach a political \nsettlement within Syria. I do not believe that military \naction by those within Syria or by external Powers can \nachieve a lasting peace, nor do I believe that America \nor any nation should determine who will lead Syria. \nThat is for the Syrian people to decide. Nevertheless, a \nleader who has slaughtered his own citizens and gassed \nchildren to death cannot regain the legitimacy to lead \na badly fractured country. The notion that Syria can \nreturn to a pre-war status quo is a fantasy. \n\nIt is time for Russia and Iran to realize that insisting \non Al-Assad\u2019s rule will lead directly to the outcome that \nthey fear \u2014 an increasingly violent space for extremists \nto operate in. In turn, those of us who continue to \nsupport the moderate opposition must persuade them \nthat the Syrian people cannot afford a collapse of State \ninstitutions and that a political settlement cannot be \nreached without addressing the legitimate fears and \nconcerns of Alawites and other minorities. \n\nWe are committed to working this political track, \nand as we pursue a settlement, let us remember that \nthis is not a zero-sum endeavour. We are no longer in \na cold war. There is no great game to be won, nor does \nAmerica have any interest in Syria beyond the well-\nbeing of its people, the stability of its neighbours, the \nelimination of chemical weapons and ensuring that it \ndoes not become a safe haven for terrorists. I welcome \nthe influence of all nations that can help bring about a \npeaceful resolution of Syria\u2019s civil war. \n\nAs we move the Geneva process forward, I \nurge all nations represented here to step up to meet \nthe humanitarian needs in Syria and surrounding \ncountries. America has committed over a billion dollars \nto that effort, and today I can announce that we will be \nproviding an additional $340 million. No aid can take \nthe place of a political resolution that gives the Syrian \npeople the chance to begin rebuilding their country, but \nit can help desperate people survive.\n\nWhat broader conclusions can be drawn from \nAmerica\u2019s policy towards Syria? I know that there are \nthose who have been frustrated by our unwillingness \nto use our military might to depose Al-Assad and \nbelieve that a failure to do so indicates a weakening of \nAmerica\u2019s resolve in the region. Others have suggested \nthat my willingness to direct even limited military \n\n\n\f\nstrikes to deter the further use of chemical weapons \nshows that we have learned nothing from Iraq, and that \nAmerica continues to seek control over the Middle East \nfor our own purposes. The situation in Syria mirrors \na contradiction that has persisted in the region for \ndecades. The United States is chastised for meddling in \nthe region and accused of having a hand in all manner \nof conspiracies. At the same time, the United States is \nblamed for failing to do enough to solve the region\u2019s \nproblems and for showing indifference toward suffering \nMuslim populations.\n\nI realize that some of that is inevitable, given \nAmerica\u2019s role in the world, but such contradictory \nattitudes have a practical impact on the American \npeople\u2019s support for our involvement in the region \nand allow leaders in the region, and the international \ncommunity sometimes, to avoid addressing difficult \nproblems themselves. So let me take this opportunity \nto outline what has been United States policy towards \nthe Middle East and North Africa and what will be my \npolicy during the remainder of my presidency.\n\nThe United States of America is prepared to use \nall elements of our power, including military force, \nto secure these core interests in the region. We will \nconfront external aggression against our allies and \npartners, as we did in the Gulf War. We will ensure \nthe free flow of energy from the region to the world. \nAlthough America is steadily reducing its own \ndependence on imported oil, the world still depends \nupon the region\u2019s energy supply, and a severe disruption \ncould destabilize the entire global economy. We will \ndismantle terrorist networks that threaten our people. \nWherever possible, we will build the capacity of our \npartners, respect the sovereignty of nations and work \nto address the root causes of terror, but when it is \nnecessary to defend the United States against terrorist \nattack, we will take direct action. Finally, we will not \ntolerate the development or use of weapons of mass \ndestruction. Just as we consider the use of chemical \nweapons in Syria to be a threat to our own national \nsecurity, we reject the development of nuclear weapons \nthat could trigger a nuclear arms race in the region and \nundermine the global non-proliferation regime.\n\nNow, to say that those are America\u2019s core interests \nis not to say that they are our only interests. We deeply \nbelieve that it is in our interest to see a Middle East and \nNorth Africa that are peaceful and prosperous, and we \nwill continue to promote democracy, human rights and \nopen markets, because we believe that those practices \nhelp achieve peace and prosperity. But I also believe \nthat we can rarely achieve those objectives through \nunilateral American action, particularly military \naction. Iraq has shown us that democracy cannot \nsimply be imposed by force. Rather, such objectives are \nbest achieved when we partner with the international \ncommunity and with the countries and peoples of the \nregion.\n\nSo what does that mean going forward? In the near \nterm, America\u2019s diplomatic efforts will focus on two \nparticular issues: Iran\u2019s pursuit of nuclear weapons \nand the Arab-Israeli conflict. While those issues are \nnot the cause of all of the region\u2019s problems, they have \nbeen a major source of instability for far too long, and \nresolving them can help serve as a foundation for a \nbroader peace.\n\nThe United States and Iran have been isolated \nfrom one another since the Islamic revolution of 1979. \nThat mistrust has deep roots. Iranians have long \ncomplained of a history of United States interference \nin their affairs and of America\u2019s role in overthrowing \nan Iranian Government during the cold war. On the \nother hand, Americans see an Iranian Government that \nhas declared the United States an enemy and directly \nor through proxies has taken Americans hostage, killed \nUnited States troops and civilians and threatened our \nally Israel with destruction.\n\nI do not believe such a difficult history can be \novercome overnight. The suspicion runs too deep. But \nI do believe that, if we can resolve the issue of Iran\u2019s \nnuclear programme, that can serve as a major step down \na long road towards a different relationship, one based \non mutual interests and mutual respect.\n\nSince I took office, I have made it clear, in letters \nto the Supreme Leader in Iran and, more recently, to \nPresident Rouhani, that America prefers to resolve its \nconcerns over Iran\u2019s nuclear programme peacefully, \nalthough we are determined to prevent Iran from \ndeveloping a nuclear weapon. We are not seeking regime \nchange, and we respect the right of the Iranian people \nto access peaceful nuclear energy. Instead, we insist \nthat the Iranian Government meet its responsibilities \nunder the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons and Security Council resolutions. Meanwhile, \nthe Supreme Leader has issued a fatwa against the \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons, and President \nRouhani has just recently reiterated that the Islamic \nRepublic will never develop a nuclear weapon.\n\n\n\f\nThose statements made by our respective \nGovernments should offer the basis for a meaningful \nagreement. We should be able to achieve a resolution \nthat respects the rights of the Iranian people while \ngiving the world confidence that the Iranian programme \nis peaceful. But to succeed, conciliatory words will \nhave to be matched by actions that are transparent and \nverifiable. After all, it is the Iranian Government\u2019s \nchoices that have led to the comprehensive sanctions \nthat are currently in place. That is not simply an issue \nbetween the United States and Iran. The world has \nseen Iran evade its responsibilities in the past and has \nan abiding interest in making sure that Iran meets its \nobligations in future.\n\nBut I want to be clear. We are encouraged by the \nfact that President Rouhani received from the Iranian \npeople a mandate to pursue a more moderate course. \nGiven President Rouhani\u2019s stated commitment to reach \nan agreement, I am directing John Kerry to pursue this \neffort with the Iranian Government, in close cooperation \nwith the European Union, the United Kingdom, France, \nGermany, Russia and China.\n\nThe roadblocks may prove to be too great, but I \nfirmly believe that the diplomatic path must be tested. \nFor while the status quo will only deepen Iran\u2019s isolation, \nIran\u2019s genuine commitment to go down a different path \nwill be good for the region and the world, and will help \nthe Iranian people meet their extraordinary potential in \ncommerce and culture, in science and education.\n\nWe are also determined to resolve a conflict that \ngoes back even further than our differences with \nIran: the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis. \nI have made it clear that the United States will never \ncompromise our commitment to Israel\u2019s security, nor \nour support for its existence as a Jewish State. Earlier \nthis year, in Jerusalem, I was inspired by young Israelis \nwho stood up for the belief that peace was necessary, \njust and possible, and I believe that there is a growing \nrecognition within Israel that the occupation of the West \nBank is tearing at the democratic fabric of the Jewish \nState. But the children of Israel have the right to live in \na world where the nations assembled in this body fully \nrecognize their country and where we unequivocally \nreject those who fire rockets at their homes or incite \nothers to hate them.\n\nLikewise, the United States remains committed to \nthe belief that the Palestinian people have a right to live \nin security and dignity in their own sovereign State. On \nthe same trip, I had the opportunity to meet with young \nPalestinians in Ramallah whose ambition and incredible \npotential are matched only by the pain they feel in \nhaving no firm place in the community of nations. They \nare understandably cynical as to whether real progress \nwill ever be made, and they are frustrated by their \nfamilies enduring the daily indignity of occupation. \nBut they, too, recognize that two States is the only real \npath to peace, because, just as the Palestinian people \nmust not be displaced, the State of Israel is here to stay.\n\nThe time is now ripe for the entire international \ncommunity to get behind the pursuit of peace. Already \nIsraeli and Palestinian leaders have demonstrated a \nwillingness to take significant political risks. President \nAbbas has put aside efforts to short-cut the pursuit \nof peace and come to the negotiating table. Prime \nMinister Netanyahu has released Palestinian prisoners \nand reaffirmed his commitment to a Palestinian State. \nCurrent talks are focused on final status issues of \nborders and security, refugees and Jerusalem.\n\nSo now the rest of us must be willing to take risks \nas well. Friends of Israel, including the United States, \nmust recognize that Israel\u2019s security as a Jewish and \ndemocratic State depends upon the realization of a \nPalestinian State, and we should say so clearly. Arab \nStates, and those who have supported the Palestinians, \nmust recognize that stability will be served only through \na two-State solution and a secure Israel. All of us must \nrecognize that peace will be a powerful tool to defeat \nextremists throughout the region and embolden those \nwho are prepared to build a better future. Moreover, \nties of trade and commerce between Israelis and Arabs \ncould be an engine of growth and opportunity at a \ntime when too many young people in the region are \nlanguishing without work. So let us emerge from the \nfamiliar corners of blame and prejudice. Let us support \nIsraeli and Palestinian leaders who are prepared to walk \nthe difficult road to peace.\n\nReal breakthroughs on these two issues \u2014 Iran\u2019s \nnuclear programme and Israeli-Palestinian peace \u2014 would \nhave a profound and positive impact on the entire Middle \nEast and North Africa. But the current convulsions \narising out of the Arab Spring remind us that a just and \nlasting peace cannot be measured only by agreements \nbetween nations. It must also be measured by our ability \nto resolve conflict and promote justice within nations. \nAnd by that measure, it is clear that all of us have a lot \nmore work to do. \n\nWhen peaceful transitions began in Tunisia and \nEgypt, the entire world was filled with hope. And \n\n\n\f\nalthough the United States, like others, was struck by \nthe speed of transition, and although we did not \u2014 and \nin fact could not \u2014 dictate events, we chose to support \nthose who called for change. We did so based on the \nbelief that while these transitions will be hard and take \ntime, societies based upon democracy and openness \nand the dignity of the individual will ultimately be \nmore stable, more prosperous and more peaceful. \n\nOver the last few years, particularly in Egypt, \nwe have seen just how hard this transition will be. \nMohammed Morsi was democratically elected, but \nproved unwilling or unable to govern in a way that was \nfully inclusive. The interim Government that replaced \nhim responded to the desires of millions of Egyptians \nwho believed the revolution had taken a wrong turn, but \nit, too, has made decisions inconsistent with inclusive \ndemocracy, through an emergency law and restrictions \non the press, civil society and opposition parties.\n\nOf course, America has been attacked by all sides \nof this internal conflict, simultaneously accused of \nsupporting the Muslim Brotherhood and engineering \nits removal from power. In fact, the United States has \npurposely avoided choosing sides. Our overriding \ninterest throughout these past few years has been to \nencourage a Government that legitimately reflects \nthe will of the Egyptian people and recognizes true \ndemocracy as requiring a respect for minority rights, \nthe rule of law, freedom of speech and assembly, and a \nstrong civil society.\n\nThat remains our interest today. And so, going \nforward, the United States will maintain a constructive \nrelationship with the interim Government that promotes \ncore interests like the Camp David Accords and counter-\nterrorism. We will continue support in areas such as \neducation that directly benefit the Egyptian people. \nBut we have not proceeded with the delivery of certain \nmilitary systems, and our support will depend upon \nEgypt\u2019s progress in pursuing a more democratic path. \n\nOur approach to Egypt reflects a larger point: the \nUnited States will at times work with Governments \nthat do not meet \u2014 at least in our view \u2014 the highest \ninternational expectations, but who work with us on our \ncore interests. Nevertheless, we will not stop asserting \nprinciples that are consistent with our ideals, whether \nthat means opposing the use of violence as a means \nof suppressing dissent or supporting the principles \nembodied in the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights. We will reject the notion that those principles \nare simply Western exports, incompatible with Islam or \nthe Arab world. We believe that they are the birthright \nof every person. And while we recognize that our \ninfluence will at times be limited, although we will be \nwary of efforts to impose democracy through military \nforce, and although we will at times be accused of \nhypocrisy and inconsistency, we will be engaged in the \nregion for the long haul. For the hard work of forging \nfreedom and democracy is the task of a generation. \nThat includes efforts to resolve sectarian tensions that \ncontinue to surface in places like Iraq, Bahrain and \nSyria. \n\nWe understand that such long-standing issues \ncannot be solved by outsiders; they must be addressed \nby Muslim communities themselves. But we have seen \ngrinding conflicts come to an end before, most recently \nin Northern Ireland, where Catholics and Protestants \nfinally recognized that an endless cycle of conflict was \ncausing both communities to fall behind a fast-moving \nworld. And so we believe that those same sectarian \nconflicts can be overcome in the Middle East and North \nAfrica. \n\nTo summarize, the United States has a hard-earned \nhumility when it comes to our ability to determine \nevents inside other countries. The notion of American \nempire may be useful propaganda, but it is not borne \nout by America\u2019s current policy or public opinion. \nIndeed, as recent debates within the United States over \nSyria clearly showed, the danger for the world is not an \nAmerica that is too eager to immerse itself in the affairs \nof other countries or to take on every problem in the \nregion as its own. The danger for the world is that the \nUnited States, after a decade of war, rightly concerned \nabout issues back home and aware of the hostility \nthat our engagement in the region has engendered \nthroughout the Muslim world, may disengage, creating \na vacuum of leadership that no other nation is ready to \nfill.\n\nI believe that such disengagement would be a \nmistake. I believe that America must remain engaged \nfor our own security, but I also believe that the world \nis better for it. Some may disagree, but I believe that \nAmerica is exceptional, in part because we have shown \na willingness, through the sacrifice of blood and \ntreasure, to stand up not only for our own narrow self-\ninterest, but for the interests of all. I must be honest, \nthough; we are far more likely to invest our energy \nin those countries that want to work with us, that \ninvest in their people instead of in a corrupt few, and \nthat embrace a vision of society where everyone can \n\n\n\f\ncontribute \u2014 men and women, Shia or Sunni, Muslim, \nChristian or Jew. Because from Europe to Asia, from \nAfrica to the Americas, nations that have persevered on \na democratic path have emerged more prosperous, more \npeaceful and more invested in upholding our common \nsecurity and our common humanity. And I believe that \nthe same will hold true for the Arab world.\n\nThat leads me to a final point. There will be \ntimes when the breakdown of societies is so great and \nthe violence against civilians so substantial, that the \ninternational community will be called upon to act. \nThat will require new thinking and some very tough \nchoices. While the United Nations was designed to \nprevent wars between States, increasingly we face \nthe challenge of preventing slaughter within States. \nAnd those challenges will grow more pronounced \nas we are confronted with States that are fragile or \nfailing \u2014 places where horrendous violence can put \ninnocent men, women and children at risk with no hope \nof protection from their national institutions.\n\nI have made it clear that even when America\u2019s core \ninterests are not directly threatened, we stand ready to \ndo our part to prevent mass atrocities and protect basic \nhuman rights. But we cannot and should not bear that \nburden alone. In Mali, we supported both the French \nintervention that successfully pushed back Al-Qaida \nand the African forces who are keeping the peace. In \nEast Africa, we are working with partners to bring the \nLord\u2019s Resistance Army to an end. And in Libya, when \nthe Security Council provided a mandate to protect \ncivilians, America joined a coalition that took action. \nBecause of what we did there, countless lives were \nsaved and a tyrant could not kill his way back to power.\n\nI know that some now criticize the action in \nLibya as an object lesson. They point to the problems \nthat the country now confronts \u2014 a democratically \nelected Government struggling to provide security; \narmed groups, in some places extremists, ruling parts \nof a fractured land \u2014 and these critics argue that any \nintervention to protect civilians is doomed to fail. Look \nat Libya. No one is more mindful of those problems \nthan I am, for they resulted in the death of four \noutstanding United States citizens who were committed \nto the Libyan people, including Ambassador Chris \nStevens \u2014 a man whose courageous efforts helped save \nthe city of Benghazi. But does anyone truly believe that \nthe situation in Libya would be better if Al-Qadhafi had \nbeen allowed to kill, imprison or brutalize his people \ninto submission? It is far more likely that without \ninternational action, Libya would now be engulfed in \ncivil war and bloodshed.\n\nWe live in a world of imperfect choices. Different \nnations will not agree on the need for action in every \ninstance, and the principle of sovereignty is at the centre \nof our international order. But sovereignty cannot be \na shield for tyrants to commit wanton murder or an \nexcuse for the international community to turn a blind \neye. While we need to be modest in our belief that we \ncan remedy every evil, and while we need to be mindful \nthat the world is full of unintended consequences, \nshould we really accept the notion that the world is \npowerless in the face of a Rwanda or a Srebrenica? If \nthat is the world that people want to live in, they should \nsay so and reckon with the cold logic of mass graves.\n\nI believe that we can embrace a different future. If \nwe do not want to choose between inaction and war, we \nmust get better \u2014 all of us \u2014 at the policies that prevent \nthe breakdown of basic order through respect for the \nresponsibilities of nations and the rights of individuals, \nthrough meaningful sanctions for those who break \nthe rules, through dogged diplomacy that resolves the \nroot causes of conflict and not merely its aftermath, \nand through development assistance that brings hope \nto the marginalized. And yes sometimes, all this will \nnot be enough and there will be moments when the \ninternational community will need to acknowledge that \nthe multilateral use of military force may be required to \nprevent the very worst from occurring. \n\nUltimately, that is the international community \nthat America seeks \u2014 one where nations do not covet \nthe land or resources of other nations, but one in which \nwe carry out the founding purpose of this institution \nand where we all take responsibility; a world in which \nthe rules established out of the horrors of war can help \nus resolve conflicts peacefully and prevent the kind of \nwars that our forefathers fought; a world where human \nbeings can live with dignity and meet their basic needs, \nwhether they live in New York or Nairobi, in Peshawar \nor Damascus.\n\nThese are extraordinary times with extraordinary \nopportunities. Thanks to human progress, a child \nborn anywhere on Earth today can do things that \n60 years ago would have been out of reach for the mass \nof humankind. I saw this in Africa, where nations \nmoving beyond conflict are now poised to take off. \nAmerica is with them: partnering to feed the hungry \nand to care for the sick and to bring power to places \noff the grid. I see it across the Pacific region, where \n\n\n\f\nhundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty in \na single generation. I see it in the faces of young people \neverywhere who can access the entire world with the \nclick of a button and who are eager to join the cause of \neradicating extreme poverty, combating climate change, \nstarting businesses, expanding freedom, and leaving \nbehind the old ideological battles of the past. That is \nwhat is happening in Asia and Africa, it is happening \nin Europe and the Americas. That is the future that the \npeople of the Middle East and North Africa deserve as \nwell, one where they can focus on opportunity, instead \nof on whether they will be killed or repressed because \nof who they are or what they believe. \n\nTime and again, nations and people have shown \na capacity to change, to live up to humanity\u2019s highest \nideals, to choose a better history. Last month, I stood \nwhere 50 years ago Martin Luther King Jr. told America \nabout his dream, at a time when many people of my \nrace could not even vote for President. Earlier this year, \nI stood in the small cell where Nelson Mandela endured \nfor decades, cut off from his own people and the world. \nWho are we to believe that today\u2019s challenges cannot be \novercome, when we have seen what changes the human \nspirit can bring? Who in this Hall can argue that the \nfuture belongs to those who seek to repress that spirit, \nrather than to those who seek to liberate it? \n\nI know what side of history I want the United States \nof America to be on. We are ready to meet tomorrow\u2019s \nchallenges with you, firm in the belief that all men \nand women are in fact created equal, each individual \npossessed with a dignity and inalienable rights that \ncannot be denied. That is why we look to the future \nnot with fear, but with hope. That is why we remain \nconvinced that this community of nations can deliver \na more peaceful, prosperous, and just world to the next \ngeneration. \n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome \nand Principe, the country that I have the honour of \nrepresenting in the highest forum of international \ndiplomacy, where all States have an equal voice \nregardless of size or geographic location and which was \ncreated as a result of a pressing need for communication \nand dialogue among the peoples of the world, I would \nfirst like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election \nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\neighth session. Your experience as a diplomat gives us \nconfidence that you will masterfully conduct the work \nof the General Assembly. In the Assembly we anticipate \npertinent debates concerning issues of the greatest \nconcern to the international community on which we \nhope to achieve consensus and identify the best paths \nto lasting solutions.\n\nWe also wish to express our appreciation and \nesteem to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \ndedication and his efforts in conducting the work of the \nOrganization, and we thank His Excellency Mr. Vuk \nJeremi. for his positive contribution as President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.\n\nToday, unfortunately, we are forced to begin our \nstatement by expressing the strongest condemnation of \nthe bloody terrorist attack in Kenya. The Democratic \nRepublic of Sao Tome and Principe offers its most \n\n\n\f\nprofound sentiments of sorrow and our solidarity \nwith the people of Kenya, their Government and the \nbereaved families.\n\nThe current international environment does not \nseem to have changed significantly since the previous \nsession. Indeed, new bloody conflicts and violence \nseem to break out almost on a daily basis everywhere, \nrevealing the deep disagreements and antagonisms \nthat exist both within each State and among various \nStates in the community of nations. The profound \nimbalance in international relations, the injustice of the \ntrading system, the enormous divide in access to goods \nand in cultural values and the glaring disparities in \ninformation access and knowledge among the peoples \nof our planet do not contribute to improved living \nconditions for millions of human beings. Rather, they \nlead to increased conflict and threats to international \npeace and security.\n\nAs it has done each year, the Democratic Republic \nof Sao Tome and Principe reaffirms, in accordance \nwith its principles, its desire to see the United Nations \nassume a more active role in righting the imbalances \nand in efforts to mediate and resolve international \nconflicts.\n\nThe fight against poverty, the struggle against \ninjustice and promoting greater dissemination of \nknowledge must, in our view, remain ongoing concerns \nof the Organization, so as to ensure that all peoples \nachieve satisfactory development and dignity, in \naccordance with the Millennium Development Goals, \nthereby reducing the level of conflict and hostility that \nis prevalent in the world today.\n\nAlong those lines, my country has implemented \nextensive political and institutional reforms in various \nareas, in order to engage all of its citizens in building \na more democratic and transparent Government and a \nmore participatory society in the pursuit of solutions \nto help fight poverty. We have not forgotten the need \nto provide the entire population with easier access to \neducation, basic health care and safe drinking water, \nas well as modern communications, as a means to \nincrease knowledge and improve living conditions. \nThat requires an enormous effort from a country with \nscant economic and financial resources; it therefore \nrequires international aid to achieve sustainability and \nthe established development goals.\n\nMy country congratulates and commends you, \nSir, for the relevance and timeliness of the theme \nproposed for the current session of the General \nAssembly \u2014 \u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: \nsetting the stage\u201d \u2014 which remains relevant despite \nthe ongoing financial and economic crisis the world \nis facing. My country remains firmly convinced \nthat addressing that important theme in its various \ndimensions during the current session and through \n2015 will encourage each and every State Member of \nthe United Nations to contribute more effectively and \ndynamically towards the future we want.\n\nIn addition to identifying the progress made in \nimplementing the eight Millennium Development \nGoals, the debate and reflection on the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda allows us to explore ways and \nmeans of building a more promising future for our \nnations and our peoples.\n\nThe sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly \nis taking place at a time when the Democratic Republic \nof Sao Tome and Principe has completed two important \nphases of public consultation aimed at guiding the \ncountry in re-charting its course to achieveing the \nMillennium Development Goals and enabling our \npositive contribution to the new post-2015 development \nagenda.\n\nGood governance, economic development, \ndeveloping human capital, food and nutritional security, \nas well as peace, tranquillity and security, are among the \nareas in which Sao Tome and Principe must improve its \nperformance in the near future and represent the basic \nrequirements to drive the country\u2019s development.\n\nThe citizens of Sao Tome and Principe are of the \nview that a new development agenda must offer a \nframework to consolidate the significant progress made \nin implementing the eight Millennium Development \nGoals \u2014 especially in the areas of education and \nhealth \u2014 as well as an opportunity to advance \ninternational political participation and exchange \naimed at development in the context of a continuously \nevolving political and economic environment and \nincreasing global challenges. We therefore thank \nthe various development partners of the Democratic \nRepublic of Sao Tome and Principe for their valuable \ncontributions towards the achievement of our goals.\n\nSince its establishment, in 1945, in accordance \nwith the principles and objectives enshrined in its \nCharter, the United Nations has been called on to play \nan important role in building and maintaining peace \nand security in the world as an essential condition for \n\n\n\f\npromoting development on a global scale. However, \nall agree that the Organization must adapt to the new \nchallenges of the times. Its operational and functional \nstructures must become more dynamic, with greater \nflexibility, so as to meet the increasing demands of the \nnew era.\n\nThe ongoing reform of the entire United Nations \nsystem must be completed, and the Democratic Republic \nof Sao Tome and Principe urges acceleration of that \nprocess. We believe that a broad and consensual reform \nof the United Nations will provide the Organization with \nthe greater flexibility, representation, effectiveness, \ncapacity and legitimacy that it requires to continue \nto ensure peace, security and development for its \nMembers.\n\nUnfortunately, the bloody conflicts that appear \nto proliferate almost everywhere and emerge where \nthey are least expected are not decreasing in number. \nWhether caused by social antagonisms resulting from \nthe poor distribution of wealth or from ethnic or \nreligious intolerance, the fact is that they persist.\n\nThere has been no significant progress in resolving \nthe continuing conflict in the Democratic Republic \nof the Congo, despite the laudable efforts of the \ninternational community \u2014 namely, the United Nations \nand the African Union \u2014 towards finding a solution that \nleads to peace and stability in the region. Therefore, we \ncannot fail to appeal to the neighbouring countries of \nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo for constructive \nforms of cooperation and trust in their relationships.\n\nWe welcome the progress made in Guinea-\nBissau following the many initiatives undertaken \nby the international community, namely, the United \nNations, the African Union, the Economic Community \nof West African States and the Community of \nPortuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP). We \ncongratulate the United Nations and African Union \nrepresentatives to Guinea-Bissau for their efforts \nas mediators in the country, in cooperation with \nother stakeholders. Those efforts created conditions \nconducive to promoting further progress in stabilizing \nand preparing the country for the general elections \nand in restoring it to constitutional and democratic \nnormality \u2014 the profound aspiration of its people.\n\nMy country is counting seriously on the stabilization \nprocess and encourages all parties involved to do their \nbest to achieve the established goals. In coordination \nwith the other States members of the CPLP, we will \ncontinue to exert every effort to contribute to the \nsuccess of that process, so that peace and happiness \nmay return to the people of our sister nation.\n\nMali, another country tormented by a fratricidal \nwar, seems to have finally reached an encouraging \npoint, as it recently held presidential elections with \nresults that have been peacefully and universally \naccepted. We congratulate the new President and hope \nthat he may find the best path towards maintaining \npeace and inclusive dialogue among all Malians.\n\nThe Central African Republic is today experiencing \none of the worst moments in its history. Indeed, we \nhave observed barbaric acts there, such as summary \nexecutions and widespread pillage. Public services \nare crumbling. The humanitarian situation has already \nbeen determined to be catastrophic by United Nations \nspecialized agencies, thus requiring vigorous and \nurgent action. Therefore, the Democratic Republic of \nSao Tome and Principe, out of concern for the suffering \nof the tormented people of our sister nation, appeals to \nthe entire international community for a more vigorous \nintervention to mitigate their suffering, preserve \nnational sovereignty and help national political actors \nto promote national unity and political stability.\n\nThe longstanding issue of the Western Sahara calls \nfor our attention and requires greater involvement from \nall in the search for a definitive solution to the protracted \nnegotiation process. We therefore welcome with \nsatisfaction the willingness expressed by the Moroccan \nGovernment to support the efforts of the international \ncommunity to achieve a negotiated political and \nmutually acceptable solution, and encourage both \nparties to return to the negotiation process.\n\nCurrently, our attention is focused on the issue \nof piracy in the Gulf of Guinea, which greatly affects \nthe safety of navigation and may destabilize countries \nin the region. That would prevent them from taking \nadvantage of their natural resources, causing great \nharm to their population. The territorial waters of Sao \nTome and Principe are 150 times the size of our land \nmass. Therefore, we are extremely concerned about \nthe risks of acts of piracy spreading in the Gulf of \nGuinea. Recently, the Heads of State and Government \nof countries that form the Commission of the Gulf \nof Guinea, which we seek to expand, held a summit \nto adopt measures aimed at combating that scourge. \nBut our firm action in that regard will be successful \nonly if we can also count on the efforts of the entire \ninternational community.\n\n\n\f\nThe Gulf of Guinea is a point of reference in \nnavigation routes that connect the northern and \nsouthern hemispheres, as well as other important \neconomic regions of the world. Its protection deserves \neveryone\u2019s attention. Combating piracy requires the \nestablishment of an environment that is conducive to \nglobal security. Since piracy is normally associated \nwith transnational crimes such as the trafficking of \narms, drugs and persons, which Sao Tome and Principe \ncondemns emphatically, my country has joined other \nStates in the region to combat such activities and has \ntaken steps at the national level that make it more \ndifficult for our territory to be used for the purpose of \nmoney laundering or the financing of other illicit or \ncriminal acts.\n\nWith regard to the bloody conflict that is \nravaging Syria and causing a humanitarian tragedy \nof great proportions, the Democratic Republic of Sao \nTome and Principe vehemently condemns the use of \nchemical weapons in violation of all international \nagreements. We also take this opportunity to welcome \nrecent developments towards dismantling the Syrian \narsenal of chemical weapons and urge both parties \nto the conflict and the international community to \npursue a compromise that will lead to the cessation of \nhostilities, thereby paving the way for open dialogue \nand negotiations within a multilateral framework aimed \nat a political solution to establish lasting peace.\n\nAs for the Israeli-Palestinian issue, we urgently \nappeal to both Israel and Palestine to move towards \nresolving their differences through dialogue, based on \nrespect for the integrity of the State of Israel and the \nright of a Palestinian State to exist.\n\nThe Republic of Cuba, whose internal reforms we \nwelcome, has the right to choose its path freely, without \nany restrictions imposed by an embargo that penalizes \nits economic and social development, with grave \nconsequences for the country\u2019s population.\n\nWe also acknowledge the climate of constructive \ndialogue between Taiwan and the People\u2019s Republic \nof China, which serves to send a positive signal that \ntensions are decreasing in the region, which we welcome \nand encourage. Both parties along the Formosa Strait \nmust work peacefully towards reaching an agreement \non the normalization of their relations. For our part, we \ncontinue to support the integration of Taiwan within \ninternational organizations.\n\nIn conclusion, I wish to reaffirm my country\u2019s \ncommitment to contributing, with the United \nNations, towards a peaceful and negotiated solution \nto international conflicts, and hope that the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda will translate into programmes \nthat can help improve the living conditions of all people \non our planet."

We \nare convinced that his rich experience as a seasoned \ndiplomat and the responsibilities that he previously \nassumed in the sphere of international relations are \nunquestionable assets for the success of this session.\n\nMy delegation fully supports the statement \nmade by Mr. Herman Van Rompuy, President of the \nEuropean Council, on behalf of the European Union \n(see A/68/PV.8) .\n\nIn my statement, I would like to touch upon a \nnumber of matters of interest to my country concerning \nthe positive developments that have occurred in the \nactivities of the United Nations since our previous \ndebate, as well as our expectations for the next period, \nin the three main areas of activity of the United Nations, \nnamely, peace and security, development and human \nrights, and democracy and the rule of law.\n\nWe believe that the efforts of the international \ncommunity and the results obtained to date in Mali \nrepresent an encouraging trend for that country and \nfor the Sahel region. One year ago, the crisis in Mali \nwas a major concern for the Malian population and \nfor neighbouring countries. Following the positive \ndevelopments that occurred in the early months of \n2013, the Security Council decided on 25 April, \nthrough resolution 2100 (2013), that the United Nations \nwould participate in restoring the situation in Mali and \nin providing support for the democratic transition in \nthat country. Remarkable progress has been achieved \nin the interim. Free and fair presidential elections were \nheld, with an unprecedented level of participation of \nthe population. Earlier this month, President Ibrahim \nBoubacar Keita was inaugurated, and the Prime \nMinister has already established the new Cabinet.\n\nAs a member of the European Union, Romania \nwelcomed the adoption of the Security Council resolution \nestablishing the United Nations Multidimensional \nIntegrated Stabilization Mission in Mali. Similarly, \nmy country has also supported the participation of the \ninternational community in the process of rebuilding \nthe capacities and institutions in Mali and has decided \nto join those efforts by contributing a contingent of \n10 military experts to the European Union\u2019s training \nmission in Mali.\n\n(spoke in English)\nAllow me to refer to other positive developments \nin the field of peace and security in the past year that \nconfirm the contribution of multilateralism to progress \nin the field of peace and security. Ensuring peace and \nsecurity through international cooperation is one of the \nmain tasks of the Organization. Within that framework \nwe have established important goals for ourselves \nin the past couple of years, and we have proved that \nworking together can lead to concrete achievements and \nsubstantial results. That is the case with the adoption \nof the Arms Trade Treaty. We have managed to jointly \ndeliver a concrete tool meant to ensure a safer world \nand address the challenges affecting the security of all \nour citizens. We must continue on that path and bring \nthe Treaty into force as soon as possible. I am pleased \nto inform the Assembly that Romania is currently \nundertaking legal domestic procedures in order to \nratify the Treaty as soon as possible.\n\nSimilar progress is expected in other areas \nof multilateral negotiations. Halfway to the next \nReview Conference of Parties to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, proceedings at \nthe Preparatory Committee, which is being chaired by \nRomania and which held its second session in Geneva \nin April, have revealed that expectations are growing \nthat more concrete results will be attained in reaching \nthe targets established in the 2010 Non-Proliferation \nTreaty action plan.\n\nRomania is a strong supporter of all endeavours \naimed at achieving comprehensive peace in the Middle \nEast. We support all the initiatives of the Quartet and \nthe full implementation of the road-map vision of two \nStates \u2014 Israel and Palestine \u2014 living side by side in \npeace and security. We therefore welcome the recent \nresumption of direct negotiations as a long-awaited \nstep forward, made possible by the constant and tireless \nefforts of the United States Administration. We are \nhopeful that both parties will take courageous steps \naimed at finding a durable solution to a problem of \nsupreme concern to their peoples, the region and the \ninternational community.\n\nWe are gratified that, since our last debate, important \nsteps have been taken to implement the key provisions \nof the final document of the United Nations Conference \n\n\n\f\non Sustainable Development, \u201cThe future we want\u201d \n(resolution 66/288, annex). Romania commends the \nefforts and dedication of Brazil and Italy in facilitating \nthe complex and strenuous negotiations that led to the \nestablishment of the High-level Political Forum and \nmade it possible to convene its inaugural meeting on \n24 September. As a member of the Open Working \nGroup on Sustainable Development Goals, sharing a \nseat with Poland, Romania is joining efforts in that very \nimportant process that will craft a comprehensive and \ncoherent set of goals for effective delivery and results \nat all levels, in accordance with the Rio de Janeiro \nConference decisions. The new framework should \nreinforce the international community\u2019s commitment \nto poverty eradication and sustainable development. \nIn that respect, we set up an interministerial ad hoc \nworking group to develop our national vision to frame \nthe future goals we wish to promote, along with our \npartners, during the ongoing negotiations on this issue.\n\nIn our view, the sustainable development goals \n(SDGs) should be universal and applicable to all States \nand should provide references and clear suggestions \nfor action and innovative mechanisms for measuring \ntheir implementation, in order to ensure sustainable \ndevelopment. At the same time, the goals should be \nbased on national ownership and take into account \ndiffering national circumstances so as to provide \npolitical space and the right to development for each \ncountry, and should address, as cross-cutting issues, \nthe perspective of human rights, peace and security, \ngood governance, gender equality, the rule of law and \nequity. Not least, we welcome the establishment of the \nintergovernmental committee to analyse options for an \neffective sustainable development financing strategy, \nand we encourage its coordination with the other \nrelevant processes, in particular the Open Working \nGroup on the SDGs.\n\nWe strongly believe that the time is ripe to combine \nefforts to define the global development framework \nfor the coming decades. The current session of the \nGeneral Assembly represents the best opportunity for \ncomprehensive and multilayered interaction to support \nthose endeavours. The theme of our political debate, \nas proposed by the President of the General Assembly, \n\u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage\u201d, \nis a confirmation of that, and we are committed to \ncontributing actively to that process.\n\nAs a current member of the Human Rights Council, \nwe believe that it is our common responsibility to \ncreate appropriate conditions of human dignity \nand welfare around the world and to make progress \ntowards ensuring equality among all human beings. \nThe Human Rights Council has proved itself up to its \nmandate, addressing in a prompt manner the situations \nof grave violations of human rights occurring in some \ncountries, especially in Syria. We fully commend the \nactivity of the Independent Commission of Inquiry on \nthe human rights situation in Syria, which reported on \nthe violations committed in that country.\n\nWe highly appreciate the universal periodic \nreview mechanism, which we consider a very useful \nand successful process. We hope that it will remain \nuniversal. We also commend the professionalism of \nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \nfor Human Rights, and we strongly believe that its \nindependence is essential for the fulfilment of the \nmandates of both the Council and the Office. \n\nAnother major area where the specialized structures \nof the United Nations and their dedicated staff deserve \nour wholehearted appreciation is that of humanitarian \nassistance. In the past year, the number of people in need \nof humanitarian assistance reached an unprecedented \nlevel. Internal and international conflicts, organized \ncrime, poverty, drought and severe violations of human \nrights are among the causes of that evolution. In too \nmany situations, the assistance offered by the United \nNations system, in close cooperation with international \nnon-governmental organizations and international \ndonors, is the only hope of survival for many thousands \nof people. We commend and support such activities. \nDespite limited financial resources, we make efforts to \ncontribute to the process. In that respect, I would like \nto mention the work of the Emergency Transit Centre \nin Timisoara, Romania. The Centre has proved to be \na refuge, offering safety to persons in urgent need of \ninternational protection, thus creating humanitarian \nspace. It is an already well-established link in the \nglobal resettlement process. We are pleased to see that \nsimilar structures have been replicated in other regions \nof the world, and we express our readiness to engage \nand share our experiences with them.\n\nAllow me now to mention some of our expectations \nfor United Nations activities in the year to come. The \nlong-standing crisis in Syria continued over the past \nyear, with increased violence that has claimed more \nthan 100,000 victims and produced more than 5 million \nrefugees. The harsh confrontations between the Syrian \narmy and opposition forces, which ultimately led to the \n\n\n\f\nuse of chemical weapons, have triggered the outrage \nand firm condemnation of the international community.\n\nRomania has continuously stated that it is \nimperative for the international community to curb the \nescalation of violence in Syria. We favour a political \nsolution under a Syrian-led transition process, based \non the cooperation of all Syrian parties with the \ninternational community, with a view to preserving \nSyria\u2019s territorial integrity. With the Security Council\u2019s \nadoption yesterday of resolution 2118 (2013), Syria has \nbeen given another chance to return to the right path. \nWe urge all parties to respect and act in accordance \nwith the provisions of that resolution, which creates the \nconditions for a negotiated peace within the \u201cGeneva \nII\u201d process. In that new context, we call on all States \nnot yet parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention \nto undertake the necessary internal measures to join it, \nin order to make sure that the use of such weapons in \nfuture is not only prohibited, but made impossible.\n\nI would like to recognize yesterday\u2019s historic call \nbetween President Rouhani and President Obama \nas a major breakthrough. The occurrence of such a \none-on-one conversation after more than two decades \nof silence gives us hope that Iran\u2019s nuclear programme \nwill become more transparent and oriented towards \nenergy alone. We await, with justifiable interest, the \nspecific plan Minister Zarif will present in that respect \nin mid-October in Geneva.\n\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations and \nspecial political missions make a major contribution \nto achieving the goals of international peace, stability \nand security. We welcome the inclusion in the agenda of \nthis General Assembly session of a new item devoted to \nspecial political missions, and we appreciate the report \nprepared by the Secretariat for that item. Member States \nwill thereby have a possibility to exchange views and \nmake proposals for policy measures in order to better \nadapt special political missions to the expectations of \ninternational, regional and local communities.\n\nRomania welcomes and supports the efforts \nto coordinate, at the United Nations level, the \nmultidimensional and cross-cutting rule-of-law \napproach. At the same time, my country supports the \ngradual implementation of the responsibility-to-protect \nconcept, starting with regional capacity-building and \nearly-warning and preventive functions.\n\nThe world is made up of regions, and each and \nevery region faces its own challenges. Efforts to \nidentify negotiated solutions to protracted conflicts \nin the Black Sea region \u2014 the Transnistrian region, \nNagorno Karabakh, Abkhazia and Ossetia \u2014 should \nremain high on our agenda.\n\nWe believe that the actions of the United Nations \nin the field of peace and security could be enhanced \nthrough increased engagement with regional \norganizations. In some regions, we have already \nexperienced the advantages of that kind of cooperation \nwith regional organizations, whose activities are \ncomplementary to those of the United Nations system. \nAs a strong advocate of the increased synergies between \nthe United Nations system and regional organizations, I \nwould like to bring to the attention of the Assembly the \npositive results obtained in recent years in promoting \nregional cooperation within the South-East European \nCooperation Process.\n\nRegional dialogue has time and time again proved \nto be the most efficient tool for overcoming the \npersisting differences of opinion among our countries. \nThis is particularly true of South-East Europe, where \nregional cooperation is now more than ever crucial to \nfurther consolidating relations between countries and, \nat the same time, to developing the region itself.\n\nMeeting the challenges of change and \ninterdependence through regional cooperation \nrepresents the overriding priority of the years ahead \nfor all the actors involved. The South-East European \nProcess is the authentic voice of the region, as it is the \nonly regional format that has significantly contributed, \nover the years, to the improvement of the overall relations \namong the participating States. Romania, which holds \nthe chairmanship-in-office of the Process, will focus \non results-oriented actions aimed at contributing, in the \nmost concrete manner possible, to the development of \nthe region.\n\nAs representatives of a country that has since 1990 \ncarried out a complex process of political, economic and \ndemocratic transition, we believe that the international \ncommunity needs to support countries undergoing \ndemocratization processes. The challenges that such \ncountries face are complex: promoting democratic \ngovernance and the rule of law; addressing specific \naspects of past human rights violations; and promoting \ntransitional justice. \n\nIn order to make a contribution to that process, my \ndelegation will put forward, during the current session \nof the General Assembly, a resolution on human rights, \n\n\n\f\ndemocracy and the rule of law in the context of the post-\n2015 development agenda. Based on our experience \nin promoting, during the March 2012 session of the \nHuman Rights Council, a similar resolution, which \nwas widely supported by 127 sponsors, we are hopeful \nthat our initiative will receive the same level of support \nfrom the General Assembly.\n\nIn concluding, I would like to reaffirm our \ncommitment to the values and principles of \nmultilateralism and to reiterate to the Assembly \nmy country\u2019s strong support for all of its efforts to \nimplement the ambitious agenda ahead of us.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to extend my sincere \ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth \nsession. The fact that you were elected by consensus \nspeaks in unequivocal terms of the high esteem in \nwhich you are held by your colleagues and the respect \nthat you command in this forum. I am confident that \nyour vast practical experience at the multilateral level \nwill serve you in good stead as you guide this session \nto a fruitful outcome. In the same breath, I pay tribute \nto your predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremi., for his astute \nstewardship at the previous session.\n\nAllow me to begin by expressing our solidarity \nwith the people of Kenya, while condemning in the \nstrongest terms the cowardly acts of terrorism that were \nseen last week.\n\nI thank you, Sir, for selecting as the theme for this \nsession \u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: setting \nthe stage\u201d, which, in my delegation\u2019s view, embodies \nthe fundamental concerns of all countries, but will \nfind particular resonance with small island developing \nStates (SIDS) like Grenada. This is an area where the \nmultilateral system must demonstrate its effectiveness \nnot only to improve the lives of ordinary citizens but also \nto maintain confidence in our multilateral institutions. \nWe look forward to key performance indicators linked \nto tangible outcomes, rather than more analysis and \nmore reports.\n\nGrenada endorses the call made at the United \nNations Conference on Sustainable Development for \nthe future we want. In that context, we must build on \nthe successes of the Millennium Development Goals \nand Agenda 21. Indeed, for a post-2015 development \nagenda we welcome a framework that goes beyond gross \ndomestic product and recognizes the assets of natural \ncapital. Grenada encourages the international financial \ninstitutions to go even further by also recognizing the \nliabilities associated with natural disasters caused by \nclimate change. Those liabilities underscore the need \nto reassess the basis on which small island developing \nStates are graduated to middle-income status, thereby \nlosing access to concessionary funding that is sorely \nneeded.\n\nThe unilateral graduation of many small island \ndeveloping States to middle-income status is premature. \nI therefore reiterate the call made in Agenda 21 for a \nmore holistic and comprehensive set of indicators for \nclassifying States. Grenada endorses support for low-\nincome and fragile economies. Moreover, it is clear that \nseveral of the SIDS newly promoted to middle-income \nstatus continue to struggle with high debt burdens, \nwhich are worsened by climate change and high fossil-\nfuel import bills. Many SIDS also struggle with low \nproductivity and low levels of competitiveness and with \nsevere financial constraints, and, in some cases, they \nstruggle with limited prospects for immediate growth.\n\nThe point is that per capita income used as a sole \nmeasure without the context of climate vulnerability \ndoes more harm than good. To illustrate that point, as \ndamaging as Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina were to the \n\n\n\f\nUnited States economy, the costs ran between 0.5 per \ncent and 2 per cent of the gross domestic product of the \nUnited States. That is in sharp contrast to the costs of \nbetween 20 per cent and 200 per cent of gross domestic \nproduct when hurricanes hit island economies.\n\nTherefore, Grenada is joining with other SIDS in \nurging the shareholders, the donors and the boards of \nthe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank \nto translate the recognition of climate vulnerability \nin small island States into a meaningful package of \nfinancial and official development assistance for SIDS.\n\nThe issue of the graduation of SIDS is an issue that \nhas been raised year after year. Let us return to the \nGeneral Assembly next year confident that progress on \nthat matter has been made. In that regard, we wish to \nsuggest for consideration during your presidency, Sir, a \ncall for a substantive paper and a debate on the issue. \nIdeally, the outcomes of that debate should be provided \nas an input towards the 2014 third International \nConference on Small Island Developing States, to be \nhosted by Samoa, and as an input to the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s debate on climate change scheduled for \nSeptember 2014.\n\nAlso contributing to the indebtedness and fiscal \nunsustainability of small island States are the volatility \nand high prices for fossil fuels. On average, small \nisland developing States are paying between 20 cents \nand 40 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity, some \nas high as $1. That contrasts with prices of 5 cents to \n15 cents in developed countries. We welcome, therefore, \nthe initiative of the Alliance of Small Island States in \nestablishing the SIDS DOCK Support Programme. \nWe also wish to express gratitude to the donors and \ninstitutions for helping to facilitate that programme.\n\nIn addition, the Government of Grenada is taking \nmajor steps towards creating a green economy. One \nof the priorities for Grenada\u2019s Prime Minister, The \nRight Honourable Keith Mitchell, is the dismantling of \na monopoly that is contributing to high energy costs \non the island of Grenada. The Government is seeking \npartners to help create a level playing field, which \nwill allow many more private-sector players to have \na role in innovative and substantive power-generation \nsolutions, while positioning Grenada as an exemplar for \na sustainable planet.\n\nMr. President, as you have chosen the theme of \nsustainability for the sixty-eighth session, so too \nhas the Government of Grenada chosen sustainable \ndevelopment as the organizing theme for the \ndevelopment of our island and for our engagement \nwith international partners. Grenada is a party to more \nthan 40 multilateral environmental agreements. The \npush to harmonize local laws with those international \ninstruments is testament to Grenada\u2019s commitment to \nthat agenda. The reasons are clear, the causes of climate \nchange and the impacts of climate change are negatively \naffecting Grenada\u2019s ability to fulfil its social contract \nwith its people, including its ability to fully deliver on \nthe Millennium Development Goals.\n\nSo far I have spoken only about economic \nsustainability and environmental sustainability. The \nthird pillar of sustainable development relates to \nsocial sustainability. Grenada is a society in which \nsocial development is given equal weighting with the \nimportance of investment and economic growth driven \nby the private sector. On 13 May, a mere three months \nafter assuming office, my Government ratified the \nInternational Convention on the Elimination of All \nForms of Racial Discrimination. We are proceeding \napace to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons \nwith Disabilities, thus demonstrating that Grenada is \ncommitted to the removal of all forms of discrimination.\n\nGrenada associates itself with efforts to dedicate the \nCaribbean region to the development of humanity. We \nalso acknowledge that through the ages the Arab world \nhas contributed enormously to the world of science \nand mathematics, including the very numerals we use \ntoday. We see a modern Arab world taking positive \nsteps to take the lead in developing breakthroughs on \nthe key issues that confront our planet. We very much \nwelcome initiatives such as Masdar City and the hosting \nof the International Renewable Energy Agency by the \nUnited Arab Emirates. The role of Qatar in hosting \nthe United Nations Climate Change Conference is \nalso noteworthy. Grenada joins with other countries in \nseeking to deepen our relationship with the countries of \nthe Gulf Cooperation Council and places a high degree \nof importance on the peace and security of the region.\n\nWe are mindful that the region and the entire United \nNations system have been seized of the issues of peace \nand security during United Nations Week. Grenada and \nmany countries in Latin America and the Caribbean \nare home to a vibrant and entrepreneurial diaspora \nfrom the Middle East, including people from Syria and \nLebanon. As a consequence, Grenadian citizens are \nvery concerned about the prospects for peace in Syria \nand the wider Middle East.\n\n\n\f\nGrenada condemns, in the most vehement terms, \natrocities and crimes against humanity. We therefore \nbelieve that those responsible for the recent deadly use \nof chemical weapons in Syria must be held accountable \nby the international community. Moreover, Grenada \nwelcomes Security Council resolution 2118 (2013), on \ndestroying Syria\u2019s chemical weapons, and is encouraged \nby the commitment of the Syrian Government to comply \nwith that resolution. More importantly, my delegation \nhopes that that breakthrough could be a stepping stone \nto the resolution of the already brutal and bloody civil \nwar in Syria, which has been fuelled by conventional \nweapons.\n\nOn 3 June, Grenada joined 83 States in signing \nthe Arms Trade Treaty on the very first morning that \nthe Treaty was opened for signature. Work is already \nunder way at the national level for the ratification of the \nTreaty, yet another signal of Grenada\u2019s commitment to \npeace and security. Moreover, being the first country \nto accede to the Convention on Cluster Munitions, \nGrenada intends to use its experience to raise awareness \non that particular matter, especially in the Americas.\n\nOn the question of Israeli-Palestinian relations, \nGrenada remains convinced that a two-State solution is \nessential to ending that conflict and urges both parties \nto conduct the present round of negotiations in good \nfaith. Grenada has good relations with the Government \nand people of Israel and is a strong advocate for \nIsrael\u2019s right to coexist in peace with its neighbours. \nFurthermore, Grenada has long been a supporter \nof the people of Palestine. Grenada is proud to have \njoined with neighbouring countries in recognizing \nthe State of Palestine and in signing a memorandum \nof understanding based upon friendship and upon an \nunderstanding of a two-State solution.\n\nAs with most of the world, Grenada looked at \nthe Arab Spring with great interest. The use of social \nmedia underscores the rise of technology as a tool for \ndemocracy on a 24/7 basis, and my Prime Minister \nplaces great importance on the use of information and \ncommunication technologies as a way to engage our \nyouth. As Egypt goes through its transition and its \npeople\u2019s call for freedom, dignity and social justice is \nheard, we encourage the leaders to learn the lessons of \nthe recent past and respond to the will of the people \nin moving forward to a system of true democracy and \nrespect for human rights and inclusive processes for \nnation-building.\n\nFinally, my delegation uses this occasion once \nmore to express our solidarity with the Cuban people, \nwho continue to suffer from an unnecessary economic, \ncommercial and financial embargo that is a relic of the \nCold War. Grenada once again calls on the United States \nof America to respect the views of the overwhelming \nmajority of humanity and lift the onerous measures \nimposed over five decades ago now.\n\nWe support your theme, Mr. President, for this \nsixty-eighth session and wish to assure our partners that \nthey can count on Grenada to be an active participant in \nthese deliberations and in the implementation of their \noutcomes.\n\nGrenada is open for business. My Government \nrecognizes that a tried-and-tested route to sustainable \ndevelopment involves a significant component of \nforeign direct investment. Grenada therefore reaches \nout and seeks new friendships while maintaining and \nbuilding upon its existing and long-standing relations \nwith many States members of this body.\n\nIn 2014 Grenada marks its fortieth anniversary of \nindependence, and we invite each and every Member to \ncelebrate with us on 7 February. We also see our 40 years \nas a milestone that recognizes 40 years of struggle, \n40 years of development. But also, more importantly, it \nmarks 40 years of expectations not yet fully delivered \nupon. As such, my Government, under the leadership \nof our Prime Minister, sees this year as the year of less \ntalk and more action, the year of tangible deliverables, \nand the year that great socioeconomic strides are made. \nWe have a young and vibrant population that cannot \nwait any longer, that should not wait any longer, and \nwith the help and cooperation of our friends, new and \nold, we will deliver. They will not wait any longer.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate \nPresident Ashe on his election to preside over the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. Let me \nassure him of my full support and cooperation and \n\n\n\f\nthat of my Government during his tenure of office. His \ncredentials and experience as a career diplomat here at \nthe United Nations assure us of a successful session. \n\nIt is indeed an honour for me to have the \nopportunity to address the Assembly once again. In my \nmaiden address last year, I spoke of the challenges that \nMalawi faced at the time that I assumed the office of \nthe President of the Republic of Malawi. I outlined my \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to addressing the political \nand economic governance problems that I inherited. I \nsought to achieve macroeconomic stability and restore \nthe rule of law and the observance of human rights.\n\nThe reforms my Government has undertaken have \nbeen painful but necessary. I am therefore pleased to \nreport to the Assembly that Malawi is registering a strong \neconomic recovery. For instance, foreign exchange and \nfuel are available, the currency has stabilized, inflation \nis declining, and industrial production is up from 30 per \ncent in 2012 to 75 per cent in 2013. Economic growth is \nforecast at 5 per cent this year, up from 1.8 per cent last \nyear. Furthermore, Malawians are once again enjoying \ntheir freedoms and civil liberties, as enshrined in the \nConstitution.\n\nI am pleased to say that Malawi, the \u201cwarm heart \nof Africa\u201d, is warm again, and my Government is \ncommitted to staying the course with these reforms. \nIn moving forward, my agenda is to build on the \nfoundations we have laid in order to realize sustainable \nand inclusive growth.\n\nToday we are gathered here to reflect on the \nprogress made on the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) and to debate the post-2015 development \nagenda. Before I provide my reflections, I would like \nto commend the Secretary-General for his efforts to \nensure an inclusive global debate on the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda. As I understand it, more than \n750,000 people from 194 countries provided their \nviews, indicating their readiness for bold change. I am \npleased that Malawi was one of the countries selected \nfor the national consultations.\n\nI believe that in Malawi and beyond, the MDGs have \nplayed an important role in concentrating our efforts \naround the common purpose of eradicating poverty. \nThey have raised public awareness about unacceptable \nlevels of poverty and helped to mobilize action towards \na fairer world.\n\nAt the same time, the MDGs have provided a \ncommon framework for monitoring progress and \nhighlighting areas of achievement as well as challenges. \nYes, they have transformed the way in which both \ndeveloping and developed countries approach \ndevelopment cooperation.\n\nMalawi is on track to achieve four of the eight \nMDGs: reducing child mortality, combating HIV \nand AIDS, malaria and other diseases, ensuring \nenvironmental sustainability, and developing a \nglobal partnership for development. However, like \nother countries, we are unlikely to meet the Goals of \neradicating extreme poverty and hunger, achieving \nuniversal access to education, ensuring gender equality \nand the empowerment of women, and improving \nmaternal health.\n\nAs the deadline for the MDGs draws closer, \nMalawi is stepping up its efforts to accelerate their \nattainment. We have identified best practices as well as \nbottlenecks in the context of our progress. In particular, \nwe have understood that gender inequality and lack of \nempowerment of women are the common constraints \nlimiting our progress towards the MDGs. In response, \nmy Government has developed a new MDG acceleration \nframework that places significance on removing these \nbarriers once and for all.\n\nIn building the foundations for the post-2015 \narchitecture, I want to reflect on the lessons from \nMalawi\u2019s experience in the implementation of the \nMDGs.\n\nFirst, I believe that the strength of the MDGs lies \nin the fact that they are focused and targeted. That \nhas helped us to narrow our focus and concentrate our \nefforts on the most critical issues while allowing local \nownership. In the case of Malawi, the MDGs were \nlocalized through the Malawi Growth and Development \nStrategy.\n\nSecondly, the past 13 years have taught us about the \nimportance of the linkages between these Goals. A poor \nfamily is not just economically deprived. It is also likely \nto face a host of other challenges such as environmental \nvulnerability, abuses of human rights and lack of or \nlimited access to essential services. Lifting people out \nof poverty therefore requires a holistic approach.\n\nThirdly, strong political will and the transformation \nof partnerships have accelerated the attainment of most \nof the MDG targets. Finally, I wish to make a cautionary \nnote that we need to be aware of the fact that different \ncontinents were at different stages of development \nwhen we established the MDGs. That created pressure, \n\n\n\f\nsometimes leading to unintended consequences. In the \ncase of Malawi and other countries, in our efforts to \nachieve universal access to education, the quality of \neducation was compromised, yet access and quality \nshould not be separated.\n\nWe all recognize that the task of developing and \nachieving consensus on the theme \u201cThe post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage\u201d may not be an \neasy one. However, we know a lot more today about \nwhat works and what does not work than we did 13 \nyears ago. We know that in order to achieve real and \nlasting change, we must be committed. We know that \nin order to inspire and motivate action, we must be bold \nand ambitious. We know that in order to maximize our \nresources and talents, we need smart partnerships.\n\nThe report of the High-level Panel of Eminent \nPersons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda \nprovides a strong foundation for a new framework. \nI applaud in particular the overall vision of ending \nextreme poverty by 2030. I also commend the focus \non, among other things, empowering girls and women, \ncreating jobs, sustainable livelihoods and equitable \ngrowth and ensuring good governance and effective \ninstitutions. I am aware that many people have argued \nthat the best strategy to achieve the MDGs is to realize \ngrowth in the gross domestic product. However, I \nam of the view that that idea is premised on a top-\ndown-approach. In my opinion, it is income for poor \nhouseholds that must come first. The issues that affect \npopulation growth \u2014 malnutrition, girls\u2019 access to \neducation, maternal health \u2014 are all rooted in poverty \nand, particularly, in a lack of income at the household \nlevel. If we have to overcome those challenges, we need \nto promote policies and programmes that bring decent \nincomes into households.\n\nIn that regard, my Government has sought new \npartnerships with the private sector, local communities \nand development partners in order to deliver \ndevelopment in more innovative ways. My Government \nis focused on transforming rural economies and \nbreaking the vicious cycle of underdevelopment and \npoverty. We have decided to invest in improving the \nlivelihoods of poor people in rural and urban areas. \nThat transformation initiative is aimed at modernizing \nour rural communities by bringing a standard package \nof interventions in health, education, water, sanitation \nand housing.\n\nThe Government has also rolled out the Malawi \nRural Electrification Programme, which aims at \nspurring industry, trade and agricultural productivity \nthrough the provision of electricity. The Government is \nalso implementing a community saving and investment \nprogramme to promote a culture of saving and building \nassets to enhance income and wealth creation. I see \nthat leading to the majority of the poor being active \nparticipants in our economy.\n\nIf we cannot uplift the people that live in rural \nareas, as is the case in many developing countries, so \nthat they can earn a decent income in the household, \nthe vicious cycle of population growth, malnutrition, \nmaternal risks and poverty will remain. If the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda is to realize its dream, we need to \ngo to the grass roots, where the people are.\n\nFor that reason, I welcome the idea that under \nthe post-2015 development agenda, we should track \nprogress against our goals by looking at them across all \nlevels of income. That will drive equal opportunities for \npeople across all income groups and help us realize our \ndreams of shared prosperity. That is key to restoring the \ndignity of all our people.\n\nFinally, let me emphasize the need to attain global \npeace and security. We are all aware that conflict, \ninstability and civil unrest disrupt our development \nefforts. As we look forward to the post-2015 agenda, \nwe should recommit to global peace and security. As a \nmother and grandmother, I felt compelled to make this \nappeal.\n\nMalawi will continue to engage fully in the post-\n2015 development agenda. I am hopeful that the voice \nof the poor, of women, of people with disabilities and \nof the marginalized will be included in the agenda. I am \noptimistic about a world of shared prosperity. \n"

        "file_text": "As he is not personally able to participate in \nthis general debate, the President of the Republic of \nBenin, Mr. Boni Yayi, has asked me to represent him. \n\nAt the outset, I would like congratulate the \nPresident on his election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session and, through him, \nto honour his country, Antigua and Barbuda, for that \nsuccess, which demonstrates the trust that it enjoys \nwithin the international community. I would also like \nto congratulate the outgoing President, His Excellency \nMr. Vuk Jeremi., who demonstrated great leadership in \nfulfilling his very busy term of office. I would also like \nto thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his efforts \nat the head of the world Organization, in particular \nsince January 2012, as part of the implementation of his \nprogramme \u201cThe future we want\u201d (resolution 66/288, \nannex).\n\nBenin fully supports the implementation of \nthat programme, which focuses on issues that are \nfully consistent with the views and priorities of the \nGovernments of the least developed countries (LDCs), \nin particular those of my Government with regard to \ngovernance matters, namely, sustainable development \nand preventing conflicts, disasters and violations of \nhuman rights, as well as ensuring the participation of \nall stakeholders in the management of public affairs.\n\nTwo years from the 2015 deadline established for \nthe achievement of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs), we can see that major efforts have been made \nby States to achieve the Goals. Assessments conducted \nat different levels have shown that least developed \ncountries are falling far behind in implementing the \nGoals, in spite of the significant progress that has been \nmade.\n\nNevertheless, it is a fact that achieving the Goals \nhas become a top priority of my Government\u2019s work \nand mobilizes a significant share of available resources. \nWe should therefore welcome the campaign started in \nApril to commence the countdown of the last 1,000 \ndays leading up to the 31 December 2015 deadline. \n\nWe have reason to hope that the new dynamic \nand the new life that has been breathed into efforts of \nthe international community will enable significant \nimprovement in the performance of least developed \ncountries. Benin has taken that opportunity to develop \na road map that includes a stopwatch for the last 1,000 \ndays in order to speed up the achievement of the Goals \nby 2015. My country is one of 16 African countries \ndeemed able to achieve at least five of the eight MDGs \nby that date. \n\nI would like to commend the leadership of the \nUnited Nations and its relevant bodies, as well as other \npartner agencies, in mobilizing energies to assist States \nin achieving the Goals. It is important to fully include \nin the post-2015 development agenda those MDGs \nthat have not been achieved on time and give them top \npriority in order to ensure there is continuity with the \nnew normative framework established by the United \nNations Conference on Sustainable Development held \nin Rio de Janeiro and the demands that will result from \nthe goals currently being developed. In that regard, the \nmain theme for the general debate of the sixty-eighth \nsession \u2014 \u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: setting \nthe stage\u201d \u2014 is quite timely and perfectly in line with \nthe consultations that have taken place at various levels \nto develop that agenda.\n\nThanks to the meticulous clarification of issues and \nchallenges by the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons \non the Post-2015 Development Agenda, appointed by \nthe Secretary General to present recommendations \nto him, we have a galvanizing vision and appropriate \nmaterials to build a unique, coherent programme \nregarding all those points, and pragmatic enough to \nensure that everybody on the planet is placed on a \nsustainable development path so everyone can have \naccess to shared a prosperity that leaves no country or \nperson aside.\n\nThe post-2015 development agenda must be \nuniversal in nature. It must also be broken down into \nspecific measures targeting reforms and corrective \nmeasures needed to re-establish any balances that have \nbeen upset or threatened. From that standpoint, it is \nof crucial importance that the situations of greatest \ncurrent concern to the international community should \nenjoy particular attention, as stipulated in principle 6 of \nthe 1992 Rio Declaration. We should therefore strongly \nsupport what is stated in the Secretary-General\u2019s report \nentitled \u201cA life of dignity for all\u201d (A/68/202), that \nthe needs of the least developed and most vulnerable \ncountries should form the basis for defining the goals \nof the programme.\n\n\n\f\nIt is a welcome fact that the situation in those \ncountries has already been the subject of significant \nthinking, with key action programmes that cover \nperiods that go far beyond 2015. In that regard, the \nIstanbul Programme of Action for the Least Developed \nCountries for the Decade 2011-2020 is and should \nbe perceived as an integral part of the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda. Its main aim is to ensure the \ntransition of half of the 49 least developed countries to \na higher-income level by 2020.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Benin is quite clear about \nits responsibility as the head of the global coordination \nbureau for the LDCs. We intend to propose the holding \nof an international conference on the theme \u201cNew \npartnerships for developing the productive capacities \nof LDCs in the context of the implementation of the \nIstanbul Programme of Action\u201d, to be held in Cotonou \nin April 2014. That effort already enjoys strong support \nfrom the United Nations and some development partners \nfrom diverse cooperation frameworks, whether they are \nNorth-South, South-South or according to other types \nof triangular partnerships. I appeal for goodwill to \nhelp make that voluntary initiative a decisive turning \npoint in terms of mobilizing the necessary resources \nto help least developed countries make the leap to \nindustrialization based on their competitive advantages. \nThat route offers LDCs a possibility for creating decent \njobs so they can make the most of their demographic \nadvantages and turn that into a factor for stability and \nprosperity.\n\nWe must enhance the role of quality, relevant \nand transformative education at the heart of the \nsocial, economic and development agendas \u2014 an \neducation system focused on the real needs of society \nand the modern world. In that regard, I welcome the \nestablishment by the Secretary-General of the Global \nEducation First initiative, which is a platform for \nleading an open debate on the aims of education in \nthe current context and to prepare children for living \nactive, productive and personally enriching lives. That \nis a prerequisite for meeting the challenge of social \ninclusion of young people.\n\nBenin has been honoured to participate actively \nsince February in the work of the group of Member States \nchampioning the initiative. I urge the international \ncommunity to support that noble project, which is a \nguarantee of adequate, inclusive training for youth. I \ncall on all countries to join the Initiative in order to \ncontribute to the collective thinking and its efficient \nimplementation.\n\nAt Rio de Janeiro we affirmed the inextricable \nlink that exists among the economic, social and \nenvironmental pillars of sustainable development. \nHowever, that vision will not materialize if we set aside \nthe existing relationship among peace, security and \ndevelopment. We should invest more in guaranteeing \npeace and security as an essential factor for sustainable \ndevelopment. At a time when we are thinking about the \nbroad outlines of the post-2015 development agenda, we \nshould also forge a consensus on the path to follow and \nthe means to strengthen the bases of international law \npursuant to respect for the essential principles of the \nCharter of United Nations, to which all States Member \nof the Organization have freely acceded. \n\nWe must constantly strive to bolster the ramparts of \npeace; without them, any development will be in vain, \nin the light of the destruction that comes from conflicts \ntriggered by their violation. I would take as an example \nthe atrocities that we see, sometimes at a frightening \nlevel, such as what occurred in Syria with the use of \nbanned chemical weapons, which we condemn in the \nfirmest possible terms.\n\nWe must reinforce the clout of the international \nregulatory regimes and make progress in the area \nof disarmament, whose paralysis carries great risk \nfor humankind. In that regard, too, we welcome the \nconclusion of the Arms Trade Treaty. \n\nWe must better harness the mechanisms for the \npeaceful settlement of disputes and conflict prevention. \nThe partnership between the United Nations and \nregional organizations is a valuable tool for building \na more integrated and solidarity-based world. That \nsolidarity must be clearly displayed against the rise of a \nviolent extremism that is increasingly dangerous when \nit takes root in our societiees by associating itself with \ntransnational organized crime networks.\n\nAll those all equally pressing challenges that the \ninternational community needs to address. We would \nbenefit from adopting a preventive and proactive, as \nwell as healing, approach in order to improve the health \nof our planet and constantly expand the vital space \nnecessary for ensuring that humans flourish, if we \nreally want to ensure the universal access to peace and \nshared prosperity that we all so sorely want. \n\n\n\f\nThe very encouraging way in which the crisis in \nMali was managed is to the credit of the partnership \nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations. \nIt proved what the international community can achieve \nif it uses its levers of our collective security system in \ntime. Benin has been honoured to take an active part, \nalongside other African countries, in the noble mission \nof rebuilding the State in Mali. \n\nThe election of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita \nis the start of a new era where Mali is returning to the \nfamily of free nations struggling to bring happiness to \ntheir peoples. In that connection, the policies adopted \nin the United Nations integrated strategy for the Sahel \nmust be decisively implemented in order to transform \nchallenges into opportunities for growth and progress \nfor the peoples of the region for the certain benefit of \ninternational peace and security.\n\nWe must also commend the efforts undertaken \nto stabilize the countries of the Great Lakes region, \nespecially the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of the \nCongo, as well as Somalia, where the African Union \nhas shown its ability to restore and rebuild peace, \nwith, of course, the support of the United Nations. The \ncase of the Central African Republic gives us pause, \nas it requires a commitment from the international \ncommunity commensurate with seriousness of the \ncurrent challenges.\n\nThe resurgence of piracy and armed robbery at sea \nin the Gulf of Guinea has had an enormous impact on \nthe economies of the countries of the Atlantic coast and \nin the hinterlands. The initiatives undertaken with the \nsupport of the United Nations and the backing offered \nby our bilateral partners have enabled us to set up \ninformation-sharing centres pursuant to resolutions \n2018 (2011) and 2039 (2012) of the Security Council. That \nwas the aim of the joint summit on maritime security \nof the Heads of State and Government of the Economic \nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), the \nEconomic Community of Central African States \n(ECCAS) and the Commission of the Gulf of Guinea \nthat took place in Yaound\u00e9 on 24 and 25 June. That \nfollowed the meeting of Foreign Ministers and Defence \nMinisters of ECOWAS, ECCAS and the Gulf of Guinea \nCommission that took place in Cotonou on 18 and \n19 March. After Yaound\u00e9, there was the Malabo summit \nof the Heads of State of the Gulf of Guinea Commission \nheld on 9 July, which took the historic decision to open \nthe Gulf of Guinea Commission to all States in the area \nof the Gulf of Guinea, which gives the arrangements an \ninclusive technical consultation framework. \n\nStrengthening regional cooperation means that \nwe need to set up an international support mechanism \nto improve cost-sharing in order to guarantee lasting \nresults. It is important for the Security Council to adopt \na new resolution to that effect.\n\nMore than ever, the United Nations must stand firm \nin its role as the best forum for a fruitful multilateralism, \nwhere different initiatives come together to give the \nnecessary impetus for more inclusive and less unjust \nglobal governance that finds comprehensive, lasting \nsolutions to crises of every stripe that trouble the world \nwith disastrous repercussions on human security and \nhuman rights.\n\nThe delays in the establishment of a Palestinian State \nwith all the attributes of an independent and sovereign \nState, including full membership in the United Nations, \nliving side by side with the State of Israel within secure \nborders and with full international guarantees is still a \nsubject of concern. In that regard, Benin welcomes the \nefforts of the Obama Administration that have led to \nthe renewal of dialogue between the Palestinians and \nIsraelis. \n\nAlong the same lines, the paralysis in the United \nNations with respect to different political and military \ncrises shows how urgent it is to reform the international \nsystem, in particular the Security Council. Achieving \nthat reform would be real proof of the commitment \nof the United Nations to inclusive and less polemic \nmanagement of the great problems of today.\n\nThe Government of Benin is firmly committed \nto the universality, indivisibility and interdependence \nof all human rights, which it considers to be the \nthird pillar of the United Nations system. They are \nconsiderations that govern our participation in the \nwork of the Human Rights Council, where we strive to \npromote a correlation between the behaviour of States \nand the international obligations they have undertaken \nthrough a mutual open dialogue and mutually enriching \ncooperation as the most effective way for developing \nand protecting universally recognized human rights \nand the fight against impunity. \n\nGovernments must undertake to create more \ncohesion between stakeholders and to ensure \nunderstanding and consensus on essential matters \nand avoid internal divisions that undermine the State \n\n\n\f\nwhile negative forces are constantly striving to wreak \nhavoc. My Government is committed to strengthening \nthe principles of democracy and the implementation of \neffective local development policies. My Government \nremains convinced that promoting, developing and \nshoring up democracy, far from being a luxury, is a \nvital and unavoidable necessity for all African States.\n\nThat is why Benin is striving each day to find the \nways and means to strengthen and streamline its political \nsystem so as to permanently anchor it in universal \nvalues. I remain convinced that democracy can be \nviable and useful for the people only if it contributes to \ndevelopment, to promoting the dignity and fundamental \nrights of citizens, to strengthening social justice and to \nmaintaining peace and international security.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to express the compassion \nof the people of Benin to the brotherly people of Kenya \nfor the tragedy they have experienced following the \nrecent terrorist attack. The same compassion goes out \nto all those people in the world who are suffering from \nintolerance and its attendant violence.\n\n"

        "file_text": "I address the General \nAssembly today with a sense of deep humility \u2014 humility \nin the wake of the great architects of world peace who \nhave stood here before me \u2014 and pride. In that regard, \nI will utilize my maiden address to this body to pay \nhomage to those who fostered the birth and initial \ndynamics of the United Nations. I therefore find it more \nthan appropriate to utilize the principles contained in \nthe Charter of the United Nations as a ready compass \nwith which to set my course as I navigate the issues that \noccupy the forefront of our attention.\n\nBefore indicating my own country\u2019s perspectives \non present trends, let me take the opportunity to \ncongratulate you, Sir, a representative of a Member \nState from my own Caribbean region, on your election \nto serve as President of the General Assembly. It is a \nclear acknowledgement by members of the General \nAssembly that all States, large or small, have a deep \nand broad interest in how international relations are \nevolving and a legitimate contribution to make towards \nresolving the problems that are having a negative \nimpact on us.\n\nAt this juncture, permit me to commence my \nnavigation. The first principle of the Charter reads as \nfollows:\n\n\u201cTo maintain international peace and security, and \nto that end: to take effective collective measures \nfor the prevention and removal of threats to the \npeace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression \nor other breaches of the peace, and to bring \nabout by peaceful means, and in conformity with \nthe principles of justice and international law, \nadjustment or settlement of international disputes \nor situations which might lead to a breach of the \npeace\u201d.\nOur world vibrates with dynamic political changes, \nsome welcome, and some threatening to the interests \nof small States and therefore unwelcome. Like other \nMember States, we prefer the peaceful resolution of \ndisputes, and therefore welcome the developments in \nthe Middle East, specifically in relation to Syria, where \nthe option of a peaceful and negotiated resolution has \ntaken precedence over the option of war. It is important \nthat in such matters we not get caught up in the emotions \nof the moment. We must be cerebral in our approach, \nbecause emotion is no substitute for intelligence, nor \nrigidity for prudence. We do not underestimate the \ndifficulties inherent in the resolution of issues and \ndisputes between nations in the Middle East. But we \nstand for the right to self-determination as a basic \nprinciple of any people\u2019s existence, and hope that in \nother parts of the region the long-standing claims to \nentitlement on the part of the people of Palestine will \ncontinue to be pursued, primarily through persistent \nnegotiation as against any inclination to the threat of \nviolence and war. We are fortunate to have the United \nNations as a framework within which we can always \nproceed to negotiate with patience and persistence until \nagreement and/or compromise is reached.\n\nThe second principle of the Charter of the United \nNations is to develop friendly relations among nations \nbased on respect for the principle of the equal rights \nand self-determination of peoples, and to take other \nappropriate measures to strengthen universal peace. \nSaint Lucia, as a small State in a hemisphere of both \nsmall and large States, emphasizes the use of diplomacy \nas a prime instrument for the pursuit of normalized \nrelations. We note the increasing mutual involvement \nof the peoples on both sides of the China Strait and \nexpress the hope that that will lead to normal relations \nbeneficial to all the peoples of the world. In that regard, \nwe welcome the response of the membership of the \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization to embrace \nthe participation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in \n\n\n\f\naspects of its proceedings. That can be an appropriate \nmodel for the further engagement of Taiwan in the \nactivities of international organizations, thus permitting \nthat country to play its role more effectively in global \ndevelopment.\n\nIn the same context, the Government of Saint Lucia \nreiterates its support for the inclusion of Cuba in all \nregional and hemispheric organizations that it wishes \nto join. We support the removal of what can clearly be \nseen as forced exclusions, which are surely no longer \npermissible under the new rules and regimes of balanced \ndiplomacy. As is evident, the exclusion of Cuba from \nnormal and complete intercourse remains an open \nwound in the heart of our hemisphere. It is unnecessary \nand needs to be ended. Saint Lucia therefore emphasizes \nits support for persistent international efforts towards \nthe removal of the unconscionable embargo that inhibits \nCuba\u2019s legitimate efforts at economic growth and full \nhemispheric cooperation.\n\nThe third principle of the Charter is to achieve \ninternational cooperation in solving international \nproblems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian \ncharacter, and in promoting and encouraging respect \nfor human rights and for fundamental freedoms for \neveryone without distinction to race, sex, language \nor religion. That is in consonance with the theme \nchosen for this year\u2019s general debate, namely, \u201cThe \npost-2015 development agenda: setting the stage\u201d. \nOver a decade ago, when the world was entering the \ntwenty-first century, the United Nations took the lead \nin setting the international development agenda. At \nthat time, we made a loud and clear declaration of war \nagainst extreme poverty and hunger, illiteracy, gender \ninequality, child mortality, poor maternal health care, \nHIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, environmental \ndegradation, as well as against the forces that seek to \nfragment our global partnership for development.\n\nOur declaration was appropriately entitled the \nMillennium Declaration, and the goals contained \ntherein were time-bound and target-driven. Today, \nless than two years before the 2015 deadline arrives, \nwe find ourselves facing new, and increasingly critical, \ndevelopment challenges. Youth unemployment has \nreached crisis proportions globally, and high debt levels \nhave threatened the solvency and stability of small \nStates. Climate change and the increasing ferocity \nof natural and man-made disasters are threatening \nthe environmental sustainability, and even the very \nexistence, of small island developing States (SIDS).\n\nGlobal interdependence demands that the strong \nhelp the weak, so that everyone can get strong. \nTherefore, the setting of the post-2015 development \nagenda is a watershed moment in global history, and all \ncountries must participate meaningfully in the process. \nThe rich must resist the temptation to retreat inward, \nas that can idle the global economic engine. The post-\n2015 development agenda must be driven by common \naspirations, shared goals and a unified vision of a \nsecure and stable world that we can proudly bequeath \nto our children.\n\nSaint Lucia and several other States have already \nembarked upon and completed post-2015 consultations, \nwith the support of the United Nations Development \nProgramme (UNDP). At least 20 such national \nconsultations have been conducted across the world, \nand they have provided invaluable inputs for the post-\n2015 agenda. They emphasize that Saint Lucia and \nother SIDS have serious vulnerabilities that seem to \nhave escaped the gross domestic product-focused eyes \nof some of our development partners. The post-2015 \nagenda must therefore address, in a very real sense, \nthe issues of concern to SIDS, such as the rise in sea \nlevel, non-communicable diseases, and the assessment \nof loss and damage caused by natural and man-made \ndisasters and the funding needed for recovery. We are \nalso concerned about the causes of climate change, \nparticularly our over-dependence on fossil fuels, and \nits destructive impact on the debt profiles of our small \nand vulnerable economies.\n\nIn that regard, we want to arrest the adverse \nconsequences of climate change before they cripple us, \nand we want to accelerate the transition to renewable \nenergy using clean, green technology. In May 2012, \nour region hosted the Conference on Achieving \nSustainable Energy for All in Small Island Developing \nStates in Barbados and, together with UNDP and other \ninternational partners, we resolved to set targets for \nincreasing the renewable component of our energy \nmix. Moreover, a month ago in Barbados, at the \nthird interregional preparatory meeting for the third \nInternational Conference on Small Island Developing \nStates, to be held in Apia, Samoa, in 2014, SIDS \nreaffirmed their commitment and renewed calls for the \nworld to pay attention to their special vulnerabilities.\n\nThat is in keeping with the fourth principle of the \nCharter of the United Nations, which asserts that the \nOrganization is to be a centre for harmonizing the \nactions of nations in the attainment of the common \n\n\n\f\nends mentioned earlier. In that regard, we recognize a \nnumber of United Nations initiatives.\n\nFirst, we note that the outcome document of the \nHigh-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly \non the Millennium Development Goals requested the \nSecretary-General to initiate thinking on a post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda and to include recommendations \nin his annual report on efforts to accelerate progress on \nachieving the MDGs.\n\nSecondly, we recognize that the 2012 United \nNations Conference on Sustainable Development has \ninitiated an inclusive intergovernmental process for \npreparing a set of sustainable development goals.\n\nThirdly, we note that the work of the \nIntergovernmental Committee of Experts on \nSustainable Development Financing, on which Saint \nLucia is represented, has proceeded in a positive \nfashion. That work includes initiatives of the Caribbean \nCommunity (CARICOM) region aimed at applying \npolicies to address the effects of the global recession \nand of new trends and rules that negate our effective \nparticipation in international trade. Such initiatives \nare promoted by our regional institutions, such as the \nCaribbean Development Bank, whose President recently \nhighlighted the need for new urgency in implementing \npolicies to help the Bank\u2019s member States to emerge \nfrom the effects of the global recession.\n\nFourthly, we take special cognizance of the special \nevent just held and convened by you, Mr. President, to \nfollow up on efforts to achieve the MDGs. We concur \nwith the recommendations that propose a framework \nfor countries like mine to come up with an evolving \nresponse to the new international environment that \nrecognizes how urgent it is that developed countries \nfulfil their official development aid commitments, and \nhow critical the MDGs are for meeting the basic needs \nof people in developing countries.\n\nIt is vital that all such initiatives on the part of the \nglobal community include arrangements such as an \nadaptation fund that can enhance the ability of small \nisland developing States to begin constructing facilities \nthat can protect our countries from sea-level rise and \nnatural disasters. Do we lie supine on our backs and hug \nthe elusive phantom of hope? No. Given the turbulent \nand unpredictable world situation that we small States \nface, we have been compelled to reassess, restructure \nand reformulate domestic and foreign policy postures \nto enable us to realistically readjust our economic and \npolitical strategies and reshape our external relations \nalong more contemporary and multidimensional \nlines. In that regard, Saint Lucia has been making a \nspecial effort in the area of regional and international \noutreach. Within our hemisphere, we have witnessed \nthe establishment and active engagement of both the \nUnion of South American Nations and the Community \nof Latin American and Caribbean States, and Saint \nLucia, like other Caribbean Community States, has \nactively engaged with them where eligible.\n\nIt is in that spirit that we have also joined the \nBolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America, \nso as to broaden our activities in the hemisphere and \nensure that we take full advantage of efforts to advance \nour country\u2019s economic growth, reduce the economic \ninequalities that result from our small size and ensure \nour full participation in the regional and global \ndecision-making that inevitably affects us.\n\nAs I speak of a better balance of global relations \nand the evolution of emergent political principles and \npractices, Saint Lucia joins with other CARICOM \ncolleagues in drawing attention to a decision of the \nCARICOM Heads of State, taken at their thirty-fourth \nregular meeting, in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, \nin July. That decision mandates our Governments to \ncollectively seek reparations, on behalf of our citizens \nand countries, for the period of exploitation experienced \nduring the transatlantic slave trade. Our Governments \nhave therefore initially agreed to the establishment of \na Caribbean reparations commission that will prepare \nthe relevant documentation and strategies for pursuing \nthe practical achievement of that goal, with a central \nfocus of righting the wrongs of the past and elevating \nthe status of our people. In that regard, we will continue \nto conduct a process of diplomatic outreach, not only \nwithin our own hemisphere and the States of the African \ncontinent, the geographic location of our ancestors, but \nalso within the wider United Nations family.\n\nI would like to reiterate the importance for small \nStates like Saint Lucia of deliberate and sustained \nefforts to resolve disputes peacefully. We support \nstrengthening the institutional arrangements of the \nUnited Nations in order to help it better fulfil its \nmandate. As the Assembly is aware, CARICOM has \nbeen actively engaged in developments relating to \nreform of the Security Council. It is an issue that Saint \nLucia\u2019s Permanent Representative has been directly \ninvolved in, particularly the question of expanding both \nthe permanent and non-permanent membership of the \n\n\n\f\nCouncil and thereby giving that body\u2019s decision-making \ngreater legitimacy. We look forward to further progress \non the matter.\n\nFor my part, I can only echo the words of the great \nRussian writer Nikolai Ostrovsky, who said,\n\n\u201cMan\u2019s dearest possession is life. It is given to \nhim but once, and he must live it so as to feel no \ntorturing regrets for wasted years, never know the \nburning shame of a mean and petty past; so live \nthat, dying, he might say: all my life and all my \nstrength were given to the finest cause in all the \nworld \u2014 the fight for the liberation of mankind\u201d.\nIt is to that aim that my country and I devote every \nmoment of our time.\nAs I conclude, Mr. President, I thank you and \nextend to you Saint Lucia\u2019s best wishes and support \nfor your successful tenure of office as you pursue \nthe tasks of the coming year, some visible and some \nundoubtedly not yet foreseen. Saint Lucia\u2019s hope is that \nas we navigate uncharted waters, we continually refer \nto the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, \nto which I have referred, in order to ensure that our \ngreat Organization remains on course, as together, with \nmutual purpose and mutual aid, we make a new period \nin history."

        "file_text": "At the outset, on behalf of the Holy See, I have \nthe honour to congratulate Ambassador John Ashe on \nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-eighth session. I am also pleased to convey \nto the President and to other participating delegations \nthe warmest greetings from His Holiness Pope Francis, \nwho assures the Assembly of his kind thoughts and \nprayers that the session will be crowned with success.\n\nIn the first days of his pontificate, Pope Francis \ninspired enthusiasm and hope for a new horizon based \non a culture of togetherness that should form the basis \nof all personal, societal and international relations. \nThat culture specifically recognizes the value of others: \nthe individual, social groups and States. It is founded \non human dignity and transcendence. It acts to reaffirm \nfaith, which is perceived with fear in certain segments \n\n\n\f\nof contemporary society and wrongly accused of \nleading to intolerance \u2014 when in fact it promotes \nunderstanding and unity among peoples and peace.\n\nIt is my hope that this session of the General \nAssembly will be inspired by the same spirit of \nuniversal solidarity that was demonstrated during the \ninternational day for prayer convened by the Pope on \n7 September, which brought together religious leaders \nof all faiths. May the session follow that path and inspire \na new dynamism such that all nations will take action \nto resolve the ongoing conflicts and heal the wounds of \nhumankind.\n\nThe choice of the theme for this session \u2014 \u201cThe \npost-2015 development agenda: setting the stage\u201d \u2014 is \na timely one. The process of the implementation of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), including \nthe progress made and the limitations and difficulties \nencountered, has demonstrated the importance of \nestablishing common goals for all members of the \ninternational community that will bring them together, \ngalvanize them and assess their efforts \u2014 including \nthe United Nations and its specialized entities, regional \norganizations and States. In that regard, it is important \nthat at this session the Assembly revisit the fundamental \nconcepts that make up the heart of the United Nations, \nas they remain relevant to setting new goals for the \npost-2015 agenda.\n\nIn the context of comprehensive human \ndevelopment, the foregoing should be guided by \npromoting the family, based on the union of a man and \na woman and the protection of the rights of the family \nas the basic social nucleus and the foundation of all \nstable and sustainable development. Those goals should \nalso promote a dignified life for all humankind, from \nthe oldest to the youngest child still at home, as well \nas those living in the most difficult social situations or \nmost isolated areas.\n\nAs the deadline set to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals approaches, it is easy to see that \nthey have not been universally achieved. That is due, in \npart, to limitations and lack of clarity, including along \nethical lines, and especially due to the difficulty in \ncreating an efficient consensus on the implementation \nof Goal 8, in view of the resources necessary to achieve \nthe seven others.\n\nIn terms of that Goal, the decisions made following \nthe 2008 crisis aimed to find an equitable way to \nmanage the international financial sector and reform \nthe international financial institutions. Nevertheless, \nit is regrettable to note that discussions on measures \nto control the global economy took place among small, \nlimited groups of States, such as the Group of 20\n(G-20); they did not include the poorest or least \npopulated States. While that was justified from a \npractical point of view, such an approach does not \nlegitimize its decisions, which could have important \nconsequences for other States Members of the United \nNations that are neither direct nor indirect participants \nin the G-20.\n\nIn order to guarantee the future implementation of \ncommon goals for the post-2015 agenda, international \nlegal mechanisms must urgently be devised to ensure the \nparticipation of all States in drafting and implementing \nsweeping shared economic decisions. At the same time, \nit will be insufficient to create financial or business \nstructures that are recognized as fair and equitable by \nall States if we do not assess the results of the goals in \nthe long term, with the aim of guaranteeing that the \nlives of those in need are clearly improving.\n\nThe future development goals of the post-2015 \nagenda should therefore identify monitoring and \nadjustment mechanisms to deal with economic trends \nand promote the elimination of hunger worldwide, the \ngradual disappearance of slums, universal access to \ndrinking water and improved sanitation for all, among \nother things.\n\nThat framework would be incomplete without \nconsidering an external development factor that is \nessential to the implementation of the MDGs, namely, \npeace. While it is true that injustice and excessive \nsocial and economic inequalities among peoples and \nnations represent a constant threat to peace and lead \nto war, it is also true that war, terrorism, organized \ncrime and other forms of armed violence at the national \nand international levels represent the most significant \nobstacles to development. Therefore, the matter of the \npost-2015 development agenda should today be viewed \nin the context of the serious conflicts under way \u2014 first \nand foremost the conflict in Syria.\n\nIn facing such wars and massacres, it is crucial \nthat the international community choose the path of \ndevelopment, with greater determination and courage. \nIf peace is considered the sine qua non of comprehensive \nhuman development, it is important to return to certain \nbasic principles that the international community \nsolemnly swore to follow nearly 70 years ago.\n\n\n\f\nThe United Nations was created, at that time, \u201cto \nsave succeeding generations from the scourge of war\u201d \nand \u201cto ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the \ninstitution of methods, that armed force shall not be \nused, save in the common interest\u201d. The right to wage \nwar, which authorized the political and autonomous \nuse of military force, was replaced by providing the \nSecurity Council with the power to authorize the use of \nforce which, under the Charter of the United Nations, \nincludes only one exception, namely, legitimate self-\ndefence, the conditions and limitations of which are \ndescribed in Article 51 of the Charter.\n\nIn that context, it is possible to consider that \nfollowing the tragedies of the First World War and the \nSecond World War, States created an international set \nof norms that provide legal instruments that establish \nthe law based on the highest sense of justice. Indeed, \ninternational law is no longer synonymous with the \nlaws of the international community, that is, laws based \non the traditions and customs of various States. Based \non the Charter of the United Nations, States sought \nto reaffirm that international law was a legal system \nwhose fundamental objective, even if it is not the \nonly one, was to control the use of violence between \nStates, and in which the limitation of the use of force \nto cases and under the conditions stipulated in the \nCharter itself represents a fundamental constitutional \nnorm. Therefore, the limitation of the use of force is the \nprimary and essential principle in terms of the ultimate \ngoal of any legal system aimed at the protection of \nindividuals and their fundamental rights.\n\nIt is tragic that today, in spite of the valuable \nUnited Nations legal principles, the implementation \nmechanisms and procedures have not managed to \nprevent serious civil and regional conflicts or protect \npeople. The African continent has many real or potential \nsituations of conflict, with dozens of armed groups that \nsow death and suffering throughout the population. \nIn that regard, I would particularly like to refer to the \nsituation in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic \nof the Congo and in the Central African Republic.\n\nThe Middle East continues to be a subject of \ngreat concern, and in some countries of the American \ncontinent drug trafficking has reached the level where \ntraffickers can wage war against States. There are \nalso significant hotbeds of tension in many regions of \nAsia. In many of those conflicts, there have been or are \nstill United Nations peacekeeping operations working \nin coordination with regional organizations. In that \nregard, a tradition of great merit has been established, \nwhich dates back to the origins of the Organization \nitself. However, history has also shown that, when \nthe necessary means are insufficient or the prevailing \nnational and international interests weigh too heavily, \nUnited Nations intervention cannot be realized or, if it \nis undertaken, has only limited success.\n\nDespite those difficulties, the whole experience \nof peacekeeping and peacebuilding developed by the \nUnited Nations should be seen as positive, including \nthose operations that have had weak immediate \nresults, because it is itself a concrete expression of the \ntwo key principles of natural law, namely, the rights \nintrinsically linked to human dignity. The first requires \nthat we do everything reasonably possible to avoid war, \ngiven the evils and injustice that war leads to; and the \nsecond affirms the permanent validity of moral law \nduring armed conflict. In that regard, acts deliberately \ncontrary to individual\u2019s rights and those universal \nprinciples are crimes, which in the most serious cases \ncan be described as crimes against humanity.\n\nIt is clear that, in the lives of people, armed conflicts \nhave led to deep divisions and serious harm that require \nmany years to heal. Today the example of greatest \nconcern to the entire world is the serious conflict that \nhas developed in Syria, which has already led to 110,000 \ndead, 4 million internally displaced persons and more \nthan 2 million refugees in neighbouring countries, \nincluding in Lebanon and Jordan. It risks becoming \nan international conflict at any moment. In addition to \nthe terrible loss of life, the conflict is destroying some \nof the richest heritage of history, culture and human \ncoexistence, strongly linked to the three monotheistic \nreligions and the whole European culture heritage. In \nrecalling the long history during which, together, the \ndifferent parts of society built that heritage and sewed \nthe fabric of human relationships, I would like to note \nthe deep concern of the Holy See for the fate of the \nChristian communities and other minorities, who should \nnot be forced in any way into exile, but rather should be \ngiven a leading role in the future configuration of their \ncountry, given their contribution to the common good.\n\nThe most recent report of the Independent \nInternational Commission of Inquiry, established by the \nHuman Rights Council, demonstrates that massacres \nand other serious violations of human rights have been \ncommitted by the parties to the conflict. The same \nexperts vehemently affirmed that there was no possible \nmilitary solution. In that context, the Holy See would \n\n\n\f\nlike to reaffirm that any action that might aggravate or \neven extend the conflict and increase the unspeakable \nsuffering of innocent people should be avoided.\n\nIn his recent letter to the Group of 20 leaders \nmeeting in Saint Petersburg, the Holy Father, recalling \nthe responsibility of the international community \nwith regard to Syria, described as regrettable the \nfact that too many partisan interests had prevailed \nsince the Syrian conflict began and had prevented \nthe finding of a solution to the pointless massacre we \nare witnessing. In recalling his words, I would like to \nurge the leaders of States not to remain indifferent in \nthe face of the tragedies that have been afflicting the \nSyrian people for far too long. To each and every one \nof the leaders, in repeating the Pope\u2019s words, I would \nlike to make a heartfelt appeal that they find ways to \novercome their differences and give up any useless \nattempt at a military solution. On the contrary, there \nshould be a new commitment to seek, with courage and \ndetermination, a peaceful solution through dialogue \nand negotiation between the interested parties with the \nfirm support of the international community. Moreover, \nall the Governments of the world have the moral duty \nto give priority to any initiative that would promote the \nprovision of humanitarian assistance to those who are \nsuffering on account of the conflict within and outside \nthe country.\n\nWe would also note that, during the Syrian crisis, \nthe bodies and agencies of the United Nations system \nhave sought to deploy all available means to protect \ncivilians. Member States have, for far too long, shown \na lack of the courage needed to give priority to the \ninternational resolution of the conflict. The Secretary-\nGeneral recently spoke of the collective failure of the \ninternational community\u2019s ability to prevent and avoid \nthe atrocities committed in Syria. Along those lines, I \nwould like to recall the concept of the responsibility \nto protect, which the Secretary-General also referred \nto, and I would also like to underscore the importance \nof that responsibility for the Holy See. The adoption \nof a political and legal concept of the responsibility \nto protect during the 2005 World Summit, held from \n14 to 16 September 2005, was a great step forward \nby the international community. Unfortunately, \nthe responsibility to protect has sometimes been \nerroneously understood to be a justification for the \nuse of arms, but in reality it means something quite \ndifferent. It is a profound and urgent spirit of solidarity \nthat calls upon everyone, starting with heads of State, to \nunderstand their responsibilities with regard to serious \nhumanitarian crises wherever they occur and to commit \nto ensuring that all emergency measures are put in \nplace \u2014 diplomatic and economic measures and those \nrelated to public opinion, as well as the mechanisms \nstipulated by the Charter of the United Nations \u2014 to \narrive at an effective solution. To provide continuity \nto the ongoing debate on the responsibility to protect, \nit would be a good idea to consider ways to explicitly \ninclude that concept in the mandate of the Security \nCouncil, under Article 24 of the Charter, and possibly \nunder Article 39.\n\nIn that context, the Syrian tragedy is both a \nchallenge and an opportunity for the United Nations \nto breathe new life into all its bodies, mechanisms and \nprocedures in a specific, creative and positive manner. \nIn that regard, we must welcome the unanimous \nadoption by the Security Council of resolution 2118 \n(2013), on 27 September. My delegation hopes that \nthe agreement that was reached on that document will \nprovide a definite impetus to the Geneva process, so as \nto make it finally possible to restore stability and bring \nabout reconciliation in the country.\n\nA peaceful and lasting solution to the conflict \nin Syria would set a significant precedent for the \nupcoming century and would indicate the path to be \ntaken in addressing other conflicts that the international \ncommunity has not yet been able to resolve. It would \ngreatly facilitate the inclusion of the principle of the \nresponsibility to protect in the Charter of the United \nNations. And, more generally from the point of view \nof economic and social development, it would be the \nmost clear demonstration of the will to undertake, \nwith honesty and effectiveness, a path of sustainable \ndevelopment post-2015.\n\nPope Francis, through his prophetic words and \nactions on 7 September, launched a huge global \nmovement of prayer for peace, the results of which \nwere immediately clear in the public\u2019s spontaneous and \nsincere support for that goal. The scope of that effort \nwent beyond differences of religion, culture, nationality \nor geographical origin, and exerted a strong influence \non world leaders. Accompanying the Holy Father and \nunder his leadership, the competent authorities of the \nHoly See also took diplomatic action aimed at stopping \nthe violence and promoting dialogue between the parties \ninvolved in the conflict, thereby putting into practice \none of the main goals of their international presence. \nAlong with the Pope and in line with the theme for this \nsession, we would like to reiterate here at the general \n\n\n\f\ndebate that war is the specific refusal to commit to the \nachievement of the major social and economic goals that \nthe international community has set for itself. Indeed, \nthere can be no economic development without peace. \nArmed conflict never leads to peace, which is crucial \nfor that development.\n\nThe Holy See believes, in line with the theological \nand ethical teaching of the Catholic Church, that \nbecause of the evils and injustices that any war entails, \nwe must do everything possible to avoid it. This is also \nwhy the Church strongly urges everyone to pray and \nact so that divine goodness frees us from the ancient \nbondage of war.\n\nMy delegation, recalling those ethical principles \nthat inspire and animate the international activity \nof the Holy See, has no ambition other than to make \na contribution of a moral nature to this session of the \nGeneral Assembly, while at the same time expressing \nits recognition for the work done by various bodies and \nUnited Nations agencies to relieve the suffering caused \nby the Syrian crisis and other conflict situations. We \nencourage them to continue their humanitarian work.\n\nMy delegation also strongly appeals to all Member \nStates to exercise responsibility. Peace will come about, \nand the objectives of comprehensive human development \nfor each inhabitant of the Earth, especially for the \nweakest and those who have no voice or representation, \nwill be achieved if, and only if, every State is capable of \nfully assuming its own responsibilities for the common \ngood of all.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset to convey to all present \nthe apologies of His Excellency Paul Biya, President of \nthe Republic of Cameroon, who wanted to participate \nin the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly \nbut was not able to owing for constraints relating to the \nnational political calendar. He instructed me to read out \nthe following message:\n\n\u201cAs President Ashe takes the reins of the \nGeneral Assembly, the United Nations is entering a \n\f\ncritical period that should lead to the defining of the \ninternational development agenda that will follow \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \nAware of his vast responsibility and the tremendous \namount of work he will be facing during this \nsession, I would like to convey to him the sincere \ncongratulations of my country in connection with \nhis election to preside over the Assembly and wish \nhim every success in this challenging but rewarding \nundertaking. His vast experience in the area of \ndiplomacy, which was made clear when he presided \nover the Commission on Sustainable Development \nand the Group of 77 and China, ensures a fruitful \noutcome to our present deliberations and to the \nwork of the General Assembly for the 12 months \nahead.\n\u201cThose same qualities were the major strengths \nof his predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremi., and I should \nlike here to commend his dynamic and effective \npresidency of the Assembly at its sixty-seventh \nsession.\n\u201cLastly, I would extend our sense of satisfaction \nto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his efforts \nin the service of peace and economic and social \ndevelopment worldwide.\n\u201cThis session is beginning in a context marked \nby the bloody terrorist acts committed in a mall in \nNairobi, Kenya, several days ago. This is for me \nan opportunity to strongly condemn those acts \nof violence and to convey to the people and the \nGovernment of that brotherly country the deepest \ncondolences of the people and the Government of \nCameroon.\n\u201cLet me, on a more optimistic note, welcome \nthe end of the crisis in Mali, which resulted in the \ndemocratic election of President Ibrahim Boubacar \nKeita. The end of that process, which had the \nwelcome support of the international community, \nrepresents a milestone in peacebuilding, security, \nnational reconciliation and development in that \ncountry.\n\u201cAs I noted at the start of my remarks, \nthroughout this session we must reflect deeply \non the post-2015 development agenda. During \nthe 2010 high-level debate, we noted that while \nprogress made in achieving some of the MDGs, \nsignificant disparities persisted between countries \nand between regions.\n\u201cWe noted that, despite the progress, at the \ncurrent pace of implementation very few countries \nwould achieve all the MDGs by the deadline. \nWith two years to go, we must point out that it \nwill be difficult for Cameroon to achieve some of \nthe Goals. Substantial progress has been made in \nreaching some of the targets. In the area of health \ncare, which is considered to be the catalyst for \neconomic and social development, with a view to \nreducing poverty, my country remains committed \nto the effort to combat the AIDS pandemic. The \nallocation of substantial resources to the fight \nagainst that disease, the distribution of free \nantiretroviral drugs, the effective care of the sick \nand the implementation of an efficient prevention \nprogramme, including the transmission from \nmother to child, have led to a considerable decline \nin the rate of HIV infection in Cameroon. From \n10.5 per cent in 2000, the rate dropped to 4.3 per \ncent in 2012, a decline of more than 50 per cent. \n\u201cAnother genuine source of satisfaction for \nCameroon is the progress made in the area of \neducation. The Government has strived to continue \nand strengthen the numerous efforts to ensure \nprimary education for all Cameroonians. I would \nunderscore that the national target is to provide \nto all children \u2014 boys and girls \u2014 throughout \nCameroon, the resources to achieve a complete \nprimary schooling cycle. The implementation of \nthe sectoral strategy on education has led to clear \nprogress in the implementation of the education \npolicy. I can mention, among other things, the \nexpansion of school infrastructure, the improvement \nin the teacher-student ratio, the reduction in the \nnumber of students who repeat a school year and \nthe improvement of girls\u2019 education. The result of \nthose actions is that the Cameroon today has one \nof the highest literacy rates in sub-Saharan Africa, \nwith an enrolment rate of nearly 100 per cent. \n\u201cBut the same progress has not been achieved \nwith respect to the targets of the other Goals. \nThat is the case for most developing countries, \nincluding Cameroon. Hence the need to further our \nthinking that began in Rio de Janeiro in the context \nof the post-2015 development agenda and, as the \nPresident wished, to set the stage for the post-MDG \ndevelopment agenda. That thinking should be based \non a clear assessment of the challenges encountered \nand lessons learned in the implementation of the \n\f\nMDGs in order to consider the prospects for the \nfuture international framework. \n\u201cThe full implementation of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals faces structural difficulties for \nsome and temporary difficulties for others. They \ninclude climate change, the financial crisis and \nfood insecurity. Those difficulties raise a number \nof important questions about how the MDGs were \nformulated. Were we too ambitious? Was the 2015 \ndeadline realistic? Would an effective follow-\nup and support mechanism for States not have \nbeen necessary? Did we give ourselves adequate \nresources to ensure implementation? Clearly, \nMillennium Development Goal 8 \u2014 \u2018develop a \nglobal partnership for development\u2019 \u2014 was the \nbeginning of an answer to the last point. However, \nthat Goal will also be difficult to achieve by 2015.\n\u201cAll the MDGs will probably not all be achieved \nby 2015. We should, however, acknowledge that \nthe programme will enable the achievement of \nclear progress in many areas. It has allowed us to \nconvey the very complex language of development \nin clear objectives accessible to all and enabled \nevery one to articulate simple requirements and \nneeds to their Government. We should safeguard \nthose achievements in framework of the post-2015 \nagenda. \n\u201cThe post-2015 agenda should also take into \naccount the viewpoint of developing countries, \nwhich are the primary targets. In that regard, I \ncongratulate the United Nations for having initiated \na broad and inclusive process of consultations \nto garner the views of all, in particular those of \nacademics and civil society organizations, with \nrespect to the MDGs and the framework that will \nfollow them. Consultations of that kind have been \nheld in Cameroon. They have enabled civil society \nto issue recommendations for the post-MDG \nframework. Those recommendations are in keeping \nwith the MDGs in terms of strengthening the \nactions to undertake in order to provide universal \naccess to primary education, to reduce maternal \nand infant mortality and to improve access to water \nand sanitation.\n\u201cFurthermore, in the context of the next \nprogramme, my country believes that particular \nfocus should be placed on creating decent jobs \nas an engine of economic growth and sustainable \ndevelopment. It is in that context that, in 2010, \nCameroon crafted a strategy document for \ngrowth and employment. That document is part \nof Cameroon\u2019s shared development vision to 2035, \nthrough which the economic performance of my \ncountry will lead to concrete results in terms of \ncreating jobs, reducing poverty and significantly \nimproving the living conditions of our people, \nespecially for women and youth. \n\u201cWhile the creation of decent jobs should, \naccording to Cameroon, occupy a central position, \nenvironmental issues should not be neglected. In \naccordance with the spirit of Rio de Janeiro, those \nissues will make it possible to determine the future \nwe want for humankind and to work seriously to \nbring it about.\n\u201cTo ensure that new development goals \nwill be achieved by the established deadline, \ncoherent national initiatives must be supported \nby an effective global partnership. Therefore, in \naddition to the provisions that may be taken at the \ninternational level by donors \u2014 increased pledges, \nconcessional loans, debt swaps, debt restructuring \nand debt cancellation \u2014 and at the national level \nby developing countries, it is crucial that control \nbe better maintained over the financial and raw \nmaterials markets in order to enable countries to \nbetter withstand external shocks.\n\u201cWe should also consider the possibility of \nsetting up a support fund for implementing the new \ndevelopment programme, as well as regular follow-\nup mechanisms at the international and regional \nlevels for achieving each goal. \n\u201cBeyond the difficulties I have already \nnoted, the MDGs, like the future international \ndevelopment framework, can be optimally achieved \nonly if an appropriate security environment is \nensured. Unfortunately, developing countries, and \nAfrica in particular, continue to be a stage for many \nconflicts. \n\u201cThe situation in the Central African Republic, \nthat in the eastern part of the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of the Congo and the turmoil following \nthe crises of the Arab Spring in North Africa are \nall sources of concern that could jeopardize the \ndevelopment efforts undertaken by the States \ninvolved. With respect to the political, security and \nhumanitarian crisis in the Central African Republic \n\f\nin particular, which has reached proportions \nunprecedented in the history of that country, \nCameroon and other States of the Economic \nCommunity of Central African States (ECCAS) \nhave shouldered their responsibilities by sending \ntroops to Bangui to stabilize the situation. Similarly, \nwe have actively contributed to the establishment \nof a road map that should enable them to restore \nnormal constitutional order within 18 to 24 months. \n\u201cCameroon calls on the international \ncommunity to support the efforts of the Central \nAfrican subregion, in particular in order to quickly \noperationalize the international support mission \nfor the Central African Republic and to mobilize \nhumanitarian assistance commensurate with the \nproblems the country faces. \n\u201cThose political, security and humanitarian \ncrises are compounded by recurrent acts of banditry, \nsuch as abductions of civilians and maritime piracy. \nThe development of the latter criminal activity, \nwhich poses a threat to international trade, has \nreached alarming proportions. According to the \nInternational Maritime Bureau, the number of acts \nof piracy identified along the coast of West Africa \nin 2012 exceeded for the first time the number of \nattacks in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean.\n\u201cTo deal with that problem, Yaounde, \nCameroon\u2019s capital, hosted on 24 and 25 June, in \naccordance with Security Council resolution 2039 \n(2012), of 29 February 2012, a joint summit of the \nEconomic Community of Central Africa States, \nthe Economic Community of West African States \n(ECOWAS) and the Commission of the Gulf of \nGuinea (GGC) on maritime safety and security in \nthe Gulf of Guinea. This was aimed at combatting \npiracy, armed robbery and other illegal activities \nperpetrated in the maritime space of the Gulf of \nGuinea.\n\u201cThe Heads of State and Government of \nECCAS, ECOWAS and the CGG, meeting together \nfor the first time since the establishment of those \nthree institutions, decided to set up an interregional \ncoordination centre to monitor anti-piracy efforts \nin their common maritime space and to pool their \nresources. The headquarters of the centre, whose \npurpose is to implement a regional strategy to \ncombat piracy, armed robbery and other illicit acts \nin the Gulf of Guinea, was given to Cameroon. \nEverything is being done to make it operational as \nquickly as possible. I would here like to commend \nthe assessment of the results of the summit by the \nUnited Nations and other strategic partners and \ntheir commitment to support the implementation of \nthe resolutions Yaounde meeting.\n\u201cAs I pointed out on the occasion of the summit, \nin order to achieve the desired security objective, \nit will be necessary for all stakeholders to fully \nassume their role in the effective implementation \nof the instruments that the three organizations have \nput in place. As with the MDGs, the support of all \nof our strategic partners is crucial to effectively \nfight against piracy and other forms of insecurity \nin the Gulf of Guinea. \n\u201cAnything that will promote the development \nof the region will contribute to improving global \ngrowth and security and represent significant \nprogress towards \u2018The future we want\u2019 \u2014 a future \nof peace and prosperity for all.\u201d\n\n"

However, that should not provide a \nvehicle for the promotion of terrorism and the spread \nof unfounded and irresponsible information through \nunregulated cyber weaponry that threatens the security \nof nations, particularly fragile States, and open societies \nof freedom and democracy.\n\nColleague after colleague who will address \nthe Assembly will no doubt express pride at the \ntremendous progress in Africa. Our continental growth \nhas averaged over 5 percent annually, surpassing \nthat of other regions. Moreover, our economies are \ndiversifying, our trade infrastructure is expanding, our \ndemocracies are strong and maturing, and our regional \ninstitutions strengthening and leading the processes of \ncooperation and integration. But the new Africa story \nis not just about growth. We see improvement in school \nenrolment, health indicators, in trade and investment. \nThe share of people living in poverty is declining. \nDemocracy, while still needing room for improvement, \nhas become the norm rather than the exception, and \ngovernance has improved significantly over the past \ndecade.\n\nWe are equally pleased with the progress made in \nresolving conflicts in several of our countries, as we \nwelcome the international support that has set Somalia \non a trajectory of peace and development.\n\nWe appreciate the strong collaboration among \nregional economic communities, the African Union \nand the United Nations, joined by the international \ncommunity, that responded robustly in the Malian \ncrisis, thereby averting the threat posed to the peace and \nsecurity of the entire region. The recent inauguration \nof a new, democratically elected President in Mali is \na clear indication that such cooperation is the surest \npath to world peace. We congratulate the newly elected \nPresident of Mali, Mr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, for \nreceiving the overwhelming endorsement of the Malian \npeople, and we commend all stakeholders for respecting \nthe outcome of the democratic process. We also salute \nthe former interim President, Mr. Dioncounda Traor\u00e9, \nand all partners for working to restore constitutional \norder within the stipulated time period.\n\nAlthough Liberia still faces the residual challenges \nof its own conflict, and despite our size and limited \nmilitary strength, I am pleased to report that a small \ncontingent of Liberian troops is currently participating \nin the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated \nStabilization Mission in Mali. We view our role in that \npeacekeeping effort as a way of reciprocating, albeit in \na small way, the countless demonstrations of friendship \nand goodwill that were accorded to us by Mali and \nother members of the international community during \nour dark days of war.\n\nOnce the epicentre of a regional war, I am pleased \nto note that the neighboring countries of the Mano River \nUnion \u2014 C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, Guinea, Sierra Leone and \nLiberia \u2014 are at peace and engaged in consolidating the \ngains of stability to accelerate national transformation \nthrough regional integration. A new Mano River Union \ninitiative will facilitate connectivity in our power and \ntransport systems, thereby enhancing cross-border \ntrade, in which our market women are actively engaged.\n\nI bring greetings from the Government and people \nof Liberia, who are this year celebrating 10 consecutive \nyears of peace and progress. In those 10 years, our \nnation\u2019s pride has been restored and we have returned \nto the community of nations as a respectable and \nresponsible partner. With the support of the international \ncommunity, especially the United Nations through \nits peacebuilding and peacekeeping efforts, we have \nrebuilt a new ethnically balanced professional army and \nincreased the size and enhanced the professionalism \nof our police, immigration and intelligence forces, in \nline with our commitment to bear full responsibility \nfor security with in our borders as United Nations \npeacekeepers execute a phased drawdown.\n\nIn that regard, we commend the Security Council \nfor its recent adoption of resolution 2116 (2013), \nwhich extends the mandate of the United Nations \npeacekeeping Mission in Liberia to 30 September 2014. \nWe fully commit to meeting all the expectations of the \n\n\n\f\nresolution, including continuing to take concrete steps \naimed at developing and sustaining a self-sufficient and \ncompetent security sector able to tackle violent crimes, \nsexual and gender-based violence and the infringement \nof the rights of the ordinary person. \n\nThanks to our commitment and the resilience \nof the Liberian people, we have instituted a host of \nreforms intended to improve governance, enhance \naccountability and create an enabling environment \nfor the exercise of basic freedoms, including freedom \nof speech and the press. That has put the country on \na path of irreversible progress, which has enabled us \nto conduct two democratic presidential and general \nelections and adjust our Vision 2030, while laying a \nfirm foundation for the transformation of our economy \ntowards moving our country to middle-income status \nby the year 2030.\n\nLiberia has come a long way, but we know that we \nhave an even longer way to go. We have done much \nin restoring basic services and infrastructure, but \nstill have much to do, especially in reducing our huge \ninfrastructure deficits in power and in transport. We have \ndone much in improving governance and strengthening \nour institutions of integrity, but still have much more \nto do in consolidating the culture of integrity and \naccountability in a society that is still beset by values \noccasioned by years of conflict. We have adopted laws \nand policies that eschew discrimination of any kind, \nto ensure social equity and equal opportunity, but still \nmust do more in promoting natural reconciliation and \nhealing. We have done much in achieving an average \nannual growth of over 7 per cent and attracted huge \nmulti-million-dollar direct foreign investments, \nespecially in our natural resource sector, but still have \nmuch more to do in expanding growth and diversifying \nour economy, making it more resilient to internal \nand external shocks and more responsive to the ever-\nincreasing demand of our people for jobs and improved \nlivelihoods. We still have much to do in continuing the \nreforms that will ensure equitable benefits from natural \nresource capital to current and future generations.\n\nAll the policies and actions that we have pursued in \nthe past several years have enabled us to stabilize our \noverall national condition. We must now, over the next \nfew years, take the hard decisions in addressing long-\nstanding structural systems. We know that the transition \nfrom stabilization to transformation can be a long and \nhard road subject to brickbats from vested interests. We \nare bound to face criticism as we attempt to apply and \nrespect the rule of law and as we challenge entrenched \nsocial habits, but we must change old mindsets and \nattitudes. We remain strong in that resolve, for it is the \nright thing to do.\n\nI was honoured to have been selected by Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon as one of three co-Chairs of \na 27-member High-level Panel of Eminent Persons \ntasked with making recommendations for a new global \ndevelopment agenda post-2015. The mandate of the \nPanel was to advise the Secretary-General on a bold \nand practical development agenda beyond 2015 that \nbuilds upon, as well as goes beyond, the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals in establishing new goals that \nare ambitious and yet achievable. Last May, the \nPanel submitted its report to the Secretary-General \nfor his consideration. We are pleased that many of \nthe principles we identified are emphasized in the \nSecretary General\u2019s report (A/68/202), rightly titled \u201cA \nlife of dignity for a11\u201d. \n\nToday more than at any other time, we have an \nopportunity to transform our world; to pursue an \nagenda that will eradicate poverty while at the same \ntime sustaining nature to secure natural resources for \nfuture generations. The solutions of yesterday may \nnot apply today\u2019s challenges, so we must muster the \ncourage to take bold steps. I therefore call upon the \nAssembly to reflect on the emerging challenges we \nface, to boldly seize new opportunities and to commit \nourselves to a new global partnership that promotes \neconomic and social transformations for inclusive and \nshared prosperity for all.\n\nIn Africa we are working towards a continental \nconsensus that will convey an African position on the \npost-2015 development agenda. I am pleased to have \nbeen asked by the African Union Summit to chair a \nhigh-level committee of 10 Heads of State that will \noversee and guide the process. We held our first meeting \nyesterday here in New York, and agreed upon a road \nmap that will ensure a global development framework \nthat is not only brave and ambitious, but one that \nreflects African priorities, a global agenda that creates \nan enabling environment for Africa\u2019s transformation \nthat includes infrastructure development, increased \nproductive capacities, resilience to external shocks \nand enhanced statistical capacities that will result will \naccelerate the reation of employment that is directed \nparticularly to our youthful populations.\n\nI am pleased to report that on 2 September, I \nchaired and launched the High-level Panel on Fragile \n\n\n\f\nStates, under the aegis of the African Development \nBank. Of the estimated 7 billion people in the world, \n1.5 billion live in situations of conflict and fragility. \nThat data puts fragile States at the centre of the new \npost-2015 agenda. We hold the view that international \npartners should accommodate the peculiarities and \nspecial circumstances of post-conflict nations. The \nachievement of sustained economic growth and \ndevelopment in those countries is critical to reducing \ntheir vulnerability to new political and economic \nshocks, fuelled in many cases by high expectation \ngaps that need to be mitigated. We therefore call on all \nour partners to renew their support to the New Deal \nfor Engagement on Fragile States, which calls for \nstronger ownership, harmonization, results and mutual \naccountability.\n\n\nI would like to conclude by expressing our gratitude \nto the United Nations family for sustaining our agenda \nof peacebuilding and sustainable development. Since \nits founding, the United Nations has had its share of \nchallenges, but it remains the beacon of hope for the \npeoples of the world who thirst for peace; a world that \nis fair, a world that is prosperous, a world in which the \nuncommon dreams of all will have a fair chance of \nrealization; a world where the weak can become strong; \na world where no nation feels developed and powerful \nuntil all nations have their share of global wealth. The \nleaders of today must rise to those challenges. The \nfuture begins today. We must commit to a new global \ndevelopment trajectory that gives all of humankind a \nworld of peace, dignity and prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to congratulate the \nPresident of the General Assembly on his election to \nserve during the sixty-eighth session of the Assembly. I \nrepose full confidence in him to steer the deliberations \nof the Assembly to a fruitful conclusion, and I assure \nhim of our full cooperation in the discharge of his \nimportant responsibilities.\n\nI take this opportunity to extend my sincere thanks \nto the outgoing President, Mr. Vuk Jeremi., for having \nsuccessfully presided over the Assembly at its sixty-\nseventh session. I would like to express my sincere \nappreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \nable and visionary leadership and excellent reports on \nissues before the Assembly.\n\nI bring with me a message of peace and non-violence \nfrom Lumbini, the birthplace of Gautama Buddha, the \napostle of peace, and the greetings and best wishes \nof the Government and people of Nepal. Nepal has \nunflinching faith in the principles and purposes of \nthe United Nations as enshrined in its Charter. Nepal \nupholds the centrality and indispensability of the \nUnited Nations in forging global peace and security, \ndevelopment and human freedom, as well as its role in \nthe promotion of multilateralism, befitting the needs of \nour age.\n\nIt is an irony that one eighth of the world population \nhas to live without enough food at a time when 150 per \ncent of the Earth\u2019s annual regenerative capacity is being \nconsumed, and that nearly 1 billion people will still be \nforced to live in extreme poverty in 2015. Looking at \nthis unfair and unjust scenario, one can hardly envision \nglobal sustainability without a system of economic \ngrowth and development that ensures the progress and \n\f\nwell-being of people on this planet in an equitable, \ninclusive and judicious manner. We can hardly realize \nsustainable development when pervasive poverty, \nunsustainable consumption and production patterns, \nand spiralling environmental degradation are allowed \nto continue.\n\nNepal attaches great importance to the full \nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). At the United Nations Conference on \nSustainable Development, our countries demonstrated \nthe wisdom to take the MDGs forward with greater \nvigour through universally applicable sustainable \ndevelopment goals. The report of the High-level Panel \nof Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development \nAgenda reminds us that there is a need to build on \nthe foundations of the MDGs, leaving no one behind \nin global development efforts. Clearly, any new \ndevelopment agenda that does not keep the elimination \nof extreme poverty at centre stage loses the spirit of \nsustainability. I therefore call upon all Member States \nto direct concerted efforts to completing the unfinished \ntasks of the MDGs before embarking on a post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda and any subsequent sustainable \ndevelopment goals.\n\nThe High-level Panel has set forth a vision for \nshaping a common destiny for the global community \nthrough inclusive economic growth, human progress \nand sustainable development. That collective vision \nneeds to be translated into concrete action with \ndeliverable goals and targets that can be measured \nglobally and locally, based on the Rio principles.\n\nWe underscore the need to breathe life into the \npost-2015 development framework with the principles \nof universal human rights, equity and sustainability. \nTo that end, we should take into account its global \napplicability, on the one hand, and regional, national \nand subnational circumstances and priorities, on the \nother. We believe that all processes relating to the \nsustainable development goals should reconcile these \nfundamental aspects, especially in the interests of the \npoor and marginalized countries and societies. Nepal is \nconstructively engaged in mainstreaming the concerns \nof the least developed countries (LDCs) into the new \nglobal development agenda.\n\nWhile no country is immune to the ominous effects of \nclimate change, countries like Nepal disproportionately \nhave to bear the brunt, in stark contrast to their \nnegligible contribution to greenhouse-gas emissions. \nNepal is the fifth most vulnerable country in terms \nof climate change risks. The risk of multiple disaster \nin overwhelming proportions and the increased \nvulnerability we have to face also threaten our fragile \nmountain ecosystem and fabulous diversity, as well as \nlives, livelihoods and heritage in Nepal.\n\nWe welcome the understanding reached in Doha \nby the Member States on a firm timetable to adopt a \nuniversal climate agreement, during the eighteenth \nsession of the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change. We call on all for an early conclusion \nto climate change negotiations, with binding emission \ncommitments and guaranteed, enhanced, predictable \nand easily accessible financing for the most vulnerable \ncountries, such as Nepal, to enable their speedy \nimplementation of suitable adaptation and mitigation \nmeasures.\n\nLeast developed countries face severe structural \nconstraints and multiple vulnerabilities, and are \nthe furthest off track in achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and other internationally agreed-\non development targets. The Istanbul Programme \nof Action for the Least Developed Countries for the \nDecade 2011-2010 (A/CONF.219/3/Rev.1) has outlined \neight priority areas to be implemented in order to \novercome those constraints and enable half of the \nLDCs to graduate from that status by the year 2020. \nHowever, in order to achieve that urgent but ambitious \ngoal, external and internal enabling environments must \nbe created through synergistic efforts on the part of the \nLDCs and their development partners. Integrating the \nProgramme of Action\u2019s priorities into all our relevant \nplans and programmes and the ongoing post-2015 \ndevelopment discourse in the United Nations is a must \nto that end.\n\nNepal has set itself the goal of graduating from \nLDC status by 2022. The Government is committed to \npursuing that goal by mainstreaming the internationally \ndefined priority areas. I ask for genuine partnerships \nand enhanced cooperation in efforts towards a full, \neffective and speedy implementation of the Istanbul \nProgramme of Action and other internationally agreed-\non development goals, with sufficient and predictable \nfunding mechanisms for our goal to become a reality. \n\nNepal\u2019s ability to benefit from trade-induced growth \nis constrained by the structural problem posed by the \nhigh transit-transport costs that its landlocked nature \nimposes. Our remoteness from markets, marginalization \n\n\n\f\nand lack of integration into regional and global value \nchains all limit the competitiveness of our trade and \nour attractiveness as an investment destination. Despite \nthe tremendous advances in technology and innovation \nthat global trade has benefited from, Nepal has yet to \ncatch up with that trend, owing to its lack of the basic \ntransport and trade infrastructure that facilitates trade. \n\nWe look forward to the 10-year review process \nof the Almaty Programme of Action: Addressing the \nSpecial Needs of Landlocked Developing Countries \nwithin a New Global Framework for Transit Transport \nCooperation for Landlocked and Transit Developing \nCountries, and to forging a successor plan of action \ncapable of addressing landlocked developing countries\u2019 \nspecific concerns and development aspirations.\n\nLDCs are still waiting for results from the Doha \nDevelopment Round and the full implementation of \nthe decisions of the Sixth Ministerial Conference of \nthe World Trade Organization (WTO) in Hong Kong \nand subsequent meetings. Forty-nine LDCs represent \nless than 1 per cent of world trade. The recent Fourth \nGlobal Review of Aid for Trade further confirmed its \ncapacity to deliver and noted that together with the \nEnhanced Integrated Framework as a vehicle, it helps \nto address supply-side constraints, enhance productive \ncapacity and promote economic diversification. We \nwill participate in the ninth Ministerial Conference of \nthe WTO in Bali in December, with the expectation \nthat LDCs\u2019 core issues \u2014 the full implementation of \nthe duty- and quota-free provision, the adoption of \nsimple and flexible preferential rules of origin and the \noperationalization of a service waiver for LDCs \u2014 will \nbe addressed effectively.\n\nThe structural deficiency and democratic deficit \nof globalization must be addressed by making it \nmore inclusive and responsive to the needs of poor \nand marginalized people around the world. More \nattention must be given to international migration \nand its potential contribution to the development of \ncountries of destination and origin, and to ensure \nthat globalization is also fair to the bottom billion of \nthe South. International migration is a cross-cutting \ndevelopmental issue of common concern. \n\nMigration is significant all over the world, but \nmore so in countries like Nepal, where nearly 1,500 \npeople leave for foreign employment every day. While \nremittances constitute nearly 25 per cent of Nepal\u2019s \ngross domestic product, Nepalese migrant workers fill \nlabour-market gaps and contribute significantly to the \nwell-being of the people and the economic development \nof their destination countries. It is extremely important \nto keep human values and dignity at the centre of \nadministration and governance related to migration. It \nis also essential to define the roles and responsibilities \nof countries of origin, transit and destination in order to \nensure the basic rights of migrant populations and show \nrespect for their contribution to development.\n\nNorth-South, South-South and triangular types of \ncooperation are becoming more significant than ever \nbefore for forging an inclusive development agenda \nand ensuring that equality and justice prevail in \nthe world. It is vital that the North make good on its \ncommitments for resources to the developing South. \nLikewise, South-South cooperation should be promoted \nby sharing development experience and transferring \ntechnology, and by exploiting latent synergies and \ncomplementarities in developing and integrating trade, \ninvestment and infrastructure facilities.\n\nWe uphold the view, close to the ideals of the \nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM), that an environment of \nlasting peace and security, conducive to people-centric \ndevelopment, can be created only through strengthened \nmultilateralism. As a distinct multilateral forum and \nmoral voice of the developing world, NAM has a \ngreater role to play in fostering international peace and \nsecurity at the United Nations and beyond. We believe \nthat NAM should pursue the issues of reforming the \nUnited Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions, \nwhich shape global social and economic policies in \ngeneral, and financial architecture in particular, in \norder to make them more inclusive and responsive to \nthe needs of the developing world.\n\nNepal reiterates its call for the general and \ncomplete disarmament of all weapons of mass \ndestruction \u2014 biological, chemical, radiological and \nnuclear \u2014 in a time-bound manner. Our efforts to \nachieve the goal of total nuclear disarmament must be \nmatched by efforts to achieve the non-proliferation of \nother weapons of mass destruction. As host this year \nto the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and \nDisarmament for Asia and the Pacific in Kathmandu, \nwe stand for strengthening regional initiatives for \npeace through dialogue, education and awareness, and \nfor subsequent confidence-building measures. Nepal \nsupports establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones, \nkeeping outer space free of weapons and keeping small \narms and light weapons out of the reach of illicit hands. \n\n\n\f\nThe Arms Trade Treaty is a landmark achievement of \nthis year.\n\nNepal unequivocally condemns terrorism in all \nits forms and manifestations perpetrated anywhere \nin the world under any pretext. Our hearts go out to \nthe victims of terrorism, most recently in Kenya and \nin Pakistan, which only strengthens our resolve to \nfight the menace. We call for the early conclusion of a \ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism to \nfight that heinous crime against humanity.\n\nAs a country emerging from conflict, Nepal \nunderscores the importance of addressing issues of \nexclusion, discrimination, inequity, corruption and \nthe violation of human rights, and it also supports the \nstrengthening of the rule of law at the national and \ninternational levels.\n\nNepal is concerned about the long, drawn-out \npeace process in the Middle East. We are overdue in \nfulfilling our commitment to a comprehensive, lasting \nand judicious solution to the problem. We support \nthe legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to an \nindependent and sovereign Palestine State, based on \nUnited Nations resolutions and a solution that enables \nIsrael and Palestine to live as neighbours within secure \nand recognized international boundaries.\n\nThe situation in Syria is of serious concern to us \nall, due mainly to the violent conflict and its attendant \nlarge-scale humanitarian tragedy. We believe the \ninternational community should facilitate the easing \nof tensions and confrontation through diplomacy and \ndialogue towards a peaceful and durable political \nsolution. We condemn the recent use of chemical \nweapons in Syria and call for the total destruction of \nchemical-weapons stockpiles in all parts of the world.\n\nI reiterate my country\u2019s principled position that the \nprotracted embargo on Cuba is unjustified and needs to \nbe ended immediately and unconditionally.\n\nNepal supports the early and peaceful unification of \nthe Korean peninsula through dialogue and negotiations \nbased on the will of the Korean people.\n\nNeedless to say, making women partners in all \nefforts for peace, security and development at all \nlevels, treating them equally without discrimination, \nand ensuring the protection of their basic rights to \nunleash their potential have positive implications for \nthe advancement of society as a whole. Moreover, their \nmainstreaming and empowerment through access to \npower and productive resources directly contribute to \ncomprehensive development. In Nepal, constitutional, \nlegislative and institutional provisions ensure equal \nrights to women and their meaningful participation \nin and contribution to society, focusing on capacity-\nbuilding, institutional strengthening, legal protection, \nempowerment and gender mainstreaming. \n\nWe are committed to our national, regional and \ninternational commitments and obligations to human \nrights, despite our protracted political transition, low \nlevel of economic growth and capacity constraints. \nPeace, democracy, human rights and development \nreinforce each other and impinge upon the people\u2019s \nuninterrupted participation in governance and an \ninclusive development process. The National Human \nRights Commission and several other human rights \ninstitutions seek to safeguard the human rights of \nour people. We are strengthening their institutional \ncapacity to deliver on their constitutional and statutory \nresponsibilities, including ensuring the rights of \nwomen, children and persons with disabilities. The \ncurrent national plan, policies and programmes of the \nGovernment are geared towards the empowerment of \nall the people, regardless of class, creed, gender or \nethnicity, and embarking on a path of socioeconomic \ndevelopment that is inclusive, fair, equitable and just for \nall, in line with the country\u2019s national and international \ncommitments. \n\nNepal is a founding member of the South Asian \nAssociation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) \nand a member of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for \nMulti-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation \n(BIMSTEC), through which we are actively involved in \nforging a synergy of collective efforts in several areas \nof regional cooperation, including poverty reduction, \ntrade expansion, investment promotion, connectivity \nimprovement and socioeconomic advancement. Nepal \nis constructively engaged with arrangements such as \nSAARC and BIMSTEC for peace and prosperity at the \nregional level and with the United Nations at the global \nlevel.\n\nMy delegation looks to the United Nations as the \nrepository of our hopes and a true upholder of the \nuniversal values of peace, justice, equality, freedom and \nhuman dignity. Given that the United Nations mandate \nand structures were founded nearly seven decades \nago, its reform has been a continuous process aimed at \nmeeting the growing requirements of changing times. \nThere are growing concerns that the United Nations \n\n\n\f\nbodies and the Bretton Woods institutions should be \nmade more democratic, accountable, financially stable \nand responsive to all, as their decisions pervade the \nsocial, economic and financial architectures of nation \nStates. Nepal supports the timely re-engineering of \nthose institutions in order to ensure the representation \nof developing countries in their decision-making.\n\nNepal holds the view that the reform of the Security \nCouncil should reflect changes in contemporary political \nand economic realities. It should be more representative \nin composition, transparent in functioning, democratic \nin character, balanced between the North and South, \nand above all be capable of taking prompt action when \npeace is threatened.\n\nFor over six decades now, Nepal has consistently \ncontributed to the work of the United Nations, \nparticularly through peacekeeping missions around \nthe world, including in the most challenging situations. \nMore than 100,000 peacekeepers have served so far \nwith distinct professionalism, and 63 soldiers have laid \ndown their precious lives in the line of duty.\n\nMy country, Nepal, is in a crucial phase of \ntaking the peace process to a logical conclusion and \ninstitutionalizing the gains made in the democratic \nrights of the people, which came through various \ncontinuous movements and struggles carried out over \ndecades. The country-driven and owned peace process \nenjoyed the support of the United Nations and the \ninternational community, for which we express our \ndeep appreciation. \n\nThe first Constituent Assembly, elected through \nthe democratic process in 2008, expired in May 2012 \nwithout completing its mandate of making an inclusive \nconstitution. In the aftermath of the dissolution of the \nConstituent Assembly, attempts to form a consensus \nGovernment, led by leaders of political parties, could not \ncoalesce in the absence of general consensus, even after \na series of attempts through dialogue and negotiations. \nThe country started to slide into political uncertainty in \nthe absence of certainty that an election would be held, \nand more complications appeared imminent. \n\nTo overcome the situation, the major political \nparties were guided by their collective wisdom to work \nout an alternative outlet that resulted in the formation \nof an apolitical and neutral Government, under the \nleadership of the Chief Justice, with the aim of holding \nfree, fair and credible elections to a fresh Constituent \nAssembly. In view of the demands of the situation to \nform a Constituent Assembly that would function as \na pivotal institution for the balance of power, I had to \naccept the responsibility in the larger interest of the \nnation and the people and as a responsible citizen.\n\nWe have made the necessary preparations to hold \nthe elections on 19 November this year. We have been \ntrying our best to listen to the dissenting parties and \nto bring them on board for the election through the \npolitical process. There is no alternative to elections to \nrevitalize the democratic process and ensure political \nstability. The election will provide a mandate by \nthe people for writing a constitution, advance civil \nand political rights, ensure people\u2019s sovereignty in \ndecision-making in State affairs and institutionalize \nmultiparty democracy, federalism and republicanism. It \nwill be instrumental in completing the remaining tasks \nof the peace process. The settlement of political issues \nthrough the democratic process will ensure political \nstability and, eventually, will open up prospects for \nbroad-based economic development, to which the \npeople have aspired for so long. I express my sincere \nthanks to the international community for the moral \nand material support made available for the elections \nand would like to convey how meaningful that gesture \nof goodwill is to us.\n\nIt is my hope and belief that, with continuing \nunderstanding, support and assistance on the part \nof all friends of Nepal, we will be able to go beyond \nthe protracted political transition and focus on the \nconsolidation of the political accomplishments made \nso far, the further democratization of the country \nand economic development, so that we may graduate \nfrom least-developed-country status by 2022. We are \nfully confident that democracy provides leverage for \nbridging differences and promoting peace, tranquillity \nand prosperity.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government of the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, I sincerely congratulate you, Sir, \non your election as President of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-eighth session. I would like to assure you of \nour full support and cooperation in discharging your \nnoble duty. I would also like to commend Mr. Vuk \nJeremi. for his successful completion of his mandate as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh \nsession. \n\nThe Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic offers its condolences to the Government and \npeople of Kenya on the loss of life as a result of the \nterrorist attacks last week in Nairobi, and I join the \ninternational community in condemning that inhumane \nact.\n\nThe year 2013 marks a new turning point in \npromoting international cooperation for development \nand in addressing global poverty. At the United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development held in \nBrazil in 2012, world leaders initiated an international \nconsultative process to chart a vision and concrete \naction for enhancing sustainable development in the \npost-2015 era. This clearly demonstrates that poverty \neradication and sustainable development remain our \noverriding priorities. \n\nIn recent decades, despite the tremendous efforts \nof the international community to achieve poverty \neradication and development targets, 1.2 billion poor \npeople \u2014 22 per cent of the world population \u2014 still \nlive in poverty. In addition, the environment continues \nto be threatened and damaged, which has led to climate \nimbalance and the frequent recurrence of natural \ndisasters that were rarely seen in the past. Moreover, \npolitical and social unrest and armed conflicts continue \nto rage in different parts of the world with no sign of \nimminent resolution. Likewise, the global and regional \neconomic and financial crisis has intensified, with \nlong-term effects on developing countries, especially \nleast developed countries.\n\nThese situations in the development, political, \nsocioeconomic and environmental spheres continue \nto obstruct and impede all nations from attaining \nthe sustainable development goals, including the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Against that \nbackdrop, it is more crucial now than ever before for \nthe international community to redouble its efforts to \nstrengthen development cooperation based on sincere \nand mutual assistance for the benefit of all and for a \nsecure world. As the world today becomes increasingly \ninterdependent, no single country can thrive and \nsurvive without the engagement and cooperation of the \ninternational community. \n\nIn that context, global institutions such as the \nUnited Nations have an important duty to advocate \non behalf of international development cooperation. \nI commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \ntireless efforts in promoting international cooperation, \nincluding between the United Nations and regional \norganizations throughout the world, in a complex and \nchallenging global environment.\n\nA nation\u2019s political stability and security are vital \nfactors for enabling an environment and conditions \nconducive to advancing sustainable development. \nHowever, many regions of the world are experiencing \nsocial unrest, political strife and military confrontation, \nwhich pose a major threat to global and regional peace \nand security. In that regard, we share the common \nconcern over the deteriorating situation in the Middle \nEast, which has lasted for years now. We call on all \nparties concerned to work together and to find a \npeaceful solution in order to save the lives of innocent \npeople. In that spirit, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic welcomes the agreement reached by Russia \nand the United States on Syria\u2019s chemical weapons. \n\nThe international community must devote urgent \nattention to the issue of Palestine on the basis of the \nprinciple of creating the two independent States of \nPalestine and Israel living side by side in peace. In \nthat regard, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \ncommends the efforts of Israel and Palestine to resume \npeace negotiations, which mark an important milestone \nfor the promotion of peace in that region. \n\nThe unilateral embargo on the Republic of Cuba, \nan independent State, is unjust and contrary to \ninternational law, and has a severe negative impact on \nthe lives of the peace-loving Cuban people. Therefore, \nit is now time to put an end to the embargo.\n\nThe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic has always \nattached great importance to creating a peaceful \nenvironment and to safeguarding political stability in \nthe interest of national development, with a view to \ngraduating from least-developed-country status. To that \nend, the Lao Government has made the utmost effort \nto pursue a consistent foreign policy and to promote \n\n\n\f\ninternational cooperation at all levels. We continue to \nfulfil our international obligations to maintain peace \nand to promote the rule of law attentively. \n\nIn this regard, the Lao Government has mapped \nout a policy for governing the State by the rule of law \nand the promotion and protection of the fundamental \nrights of people of all backgrounds. The Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic is party to many international \nhuman rights instruments. We have enacted and \namended a national law on human rights, including the \nrights of women and children.\n\nTo continue fulfilling its international obligations, \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic has presented \nits candidatures for membership of the Human Rights \nCouncil, for the term of 2016-2018, and of the Executive \nBoard of the United Nations Development Programme/\nUnited Nations Population Fund/United Nations Office \nfor Project Services for 2016-2018. We hope that the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic will be given an \nopportunity to work with the international community \nwithin the aforementioned frameworks.\n\nAt the regional level, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic has played an active part in the process of \ncommunity-building of the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN), which consists of three \npillars: the political-security community, the economic \ncommunity and the sociocultural community. We \nbelieve that the political and economic strength of \nthe ASEAN community will form a solid ground for \nregional cooperation, thereby contributing to the \nmaintenance and promotion of peace, security and \ndevelopment in the region and the world at large.\n\nThe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic played an \nimportant role as Chair of the framework of cooperation \nbetween the continents of Asia and Europe \u2014 the Asia-\nEurope Meeting (ASEM) \u2014 from 2010 to 2012, and \nwas greatly honoured to host the ninth ASEM Summit \non 5 and 6 November in Vientiane, under the theme \n\u201cFriends for peace, partners for prosperity\u201d, which was \nsuccessfully concluded. At the Summit, leaders from \nthe two continents had a constructive exchange of views \non the ways and means to promote peace and enhance \ndevelopment cooperation in their respective regions \nfor the benefits of the peoples of Asia and Europe, as \nwell as to ensure their legitimate rights to live in peace \nand to improve their well-being. The Lao Government \nwas proud to have been given the opportunity to fulfil \nthat important obligation, and I take this opportunity \nto express my deep gratitude to all friendly countries \nand the international community for their support and \nassistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, \nwhich led to the successful outcome of the Summit.\n\nDespite various achievements in its socioeconomic \ndevelopment, as both a least developed and a landlocked \ncountry the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic remains \nvulnerable and continues to face numerous challenges \nin its development and poverty-reduction efforts, as \nclearly reflected in the recent third national MDG \nprogress report, issued early this month. If it is to achieve \nall the MDGs, the country must continue to overcome \ndaunting challenges, such as child malnutrition, gender \ninequality in education and the impact of unexploded \nordnance contamination. Nevertheless, the Lao \nGovernment will continue to lead its people in moving \nahead together with the international community in \ntackling numerous challenges in order to achieve the \nMDGs.\n\nThe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic is among \nthose countries most affected by cluster munitions and \nunexploded ordnance, which continue to pose major \nconstraints to national socioeconomic development \nand poverty reduction. In that regard, the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic calls on all countries to consider \nacceding to the Convention on Cluster Munitions with \na view to ensuring a total ban on those weapons and to \nhelping to address the impact of cluster munitions.\n\nIn 2014, the group of landlocked developing countries \n(LLDCs) will hold a 10-year Review Conference on the \nImplementation of the Almaty Programme of Action to \naddress the particular problems and special needs of \nthe LLDCs. Adressing the specific problems of LLDCs \nhas become a regional and international obligation. \nRegardless of their development level, these countries \nwill not be able to address the impacts of their landlocked \ncondition without international cooperation, especially \nfrom transit countries and development partners.\n\nIn that context, the 2014 Review Conference will \nbe of great importance not only for the LLDCs, but \nalso for all development partners. The Conference will \nprovide an excellent opportunity for the international \ncommunity to identify the emerging challenges and \nengage in new cooperation aimed at addressing the \nimpact of the landlocked status faced by the LLDCs. \nWe have high hopes and expectations for the outcome \nof the Conference, which could adopt a new policy \ndirection and more concrete measures reflecting the \n\n\n\f\ncurrent development environment. This could form the \nbasis for addressing the specific problems faced by the \nLLDCs in the next decade. \n\nThe success of the Conference would certainly \ndemonstrate the spirit of genuine partnership and \nmutual assistance among members of the international \ncommunity. Therefore, in my capacity as chair of the \ngroup of LLDCs, I call on all parties, international \norganizations \u2014 including the United Nations \nsystem \u2014 international financial institutions, the \nprivate sector and non-governmental organizations to \nparticipate actively in the preparation and organization \nof the Conference in view of ensuring its successful \noutcome.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, \non behalf of Ukraine, I sincerely congratulate Mr. John \nWilliam Ashe on his election to serve as President of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I wish \nhim success and fruitful work as he discharges this \nimportant role.\n\nThe theme of the present session, \u201cThe post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage\u201d, is undoubtedly \nimportant for every Member State. The deadline for \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals is fast \napproaching, and the task of producing the ambitious \npost-2015 action plan is becoming ever more urgent \nfor the international community. I am glad that \npractical work on implementing that task has already \nbeen launched. Its current intensity is confirmed by \ntwo important events: the General Assembly special \nevent to follow up efforts made towards achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals and the inaugural \nmeeting of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable \nDevelopment.\n\nI am convinced that the actions planned by the \nPresident of the General Assembly will allow for \nsubstantial acceleration during the sixty-eighth session \nof the work on elaboration of development goals for the \nupcoming period. We consider the innovative national \nconsultations mechanisms, which are being successfully \napplied in the case of Ukraine, an important element \nof this work. Ukraine stands ready to be engaged fully \nand with maximum efficiency in these developments, \nwhich are extremely important for the international \ncommunity.\n\nThe topic of sustainable energy as an item of the \npost-2015 agenda is of particular significance to us. A \nnew, inclusive approach to that issue must ensure the \ncomprehensive consideration of security, social and \nenvironmental aspects. Only such an approach will \nfacilitate sustainable development of energy, especially \nas regards the efficiency and safety of the nuclear \nsector. That objective would be favoured by the further \ndevelopment of and joint action on the implementation \nof the outcomes of Kyiv Summit on the Safe and \nInnovative Use of Nuclear Energy, which was held in \nApril 2011.\n\nUkraine, which experienced the worst nuclear \naccident in the history of humankind, is well aware of \nthe priority importance of issues of ecological safety, \nthe comprehensive conservation of the environment \nand prudent management of water resources. We \nencourage Member States to intensify international \ninteraction in this field as part of their observation of \nthe International Year of Water Cooperation and the \ntwentieth anniversary of World Water Day.\n\nUkraine will continue to diligently do its part \nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals at \nthe national level. We are eager to establish positive \nmomentum on many key national development \nindicators. These indicators include poverty alleviation, \nquality education, environmental conservation, \nmaternal health improvement and child mortality \nreduction, among others. The leading catalyst for \nUkraine\u2019s progress towards the Goals is the reform \nprogramme, which is the largest such programme in \nthe recent history of our country, aimed at both social \nand economic transformations as well as the further \nstrengthening of the democratic system and the rule of \nlaw. The fundamental basis for internal transformation \nin Ukraine will continue to be supremacy of the \nprinciple of social justice.\n\nWe also view Ukraine\u2019s European integration \naspirations in the light of sustainable development. \nThese aspirations are a determining vector for the \ncountry\u2019s development. Ukraine makes its contribution \nto the greater European project, which unites the \ninterests and development goals of the countries of the \nWest to those of the East of our continent. I strongly \nbelieve that the signing in November of the Association \nAgreement between Ukraine and the European Union, \nincluding the creation of a Deep and Comprehensive \nFree Trade Area, will be an important tool in raising \nthe welfare of Ukrainian citizens and will duly assist \nour country in achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals.\n\nIt has long been broadly agreed that sustainable \ndevelopment is impossible without efficient international \nsecurity. Conversely, lasting peace is impossible \nwithout sustainable development. Events since last \nyear\u2019s debate have clearly shown the inconsistency \nand instability of the world today. It is a world that, \ndespite our common efforts, has not embarked on a \nmore even and reliable trajectory of universal peace. \nOn the contrary, according to the Global Peace Index, \n\n\n\f\nour world has become less safe than it was five years \nago.\n\nOne of the most painful security problems of today \nis the civil conflict in Syria, which, unfortunately, is \nincreasingly crossing borders and becoming the source \nof threats on a regional scale. There is no justification \nfor bloodshed and suffering of the civilian population, \nincluding women and children, more than 1.5 million \nrefugees and internally displaced persons, and tens \nof thousands of foreign citizens who have found \nthemselves in danger. We must do everything in our \npower to allay the pain and to contain and heal the open \nwound of his conflict as soon as possible.\n\nIn our joint actions to settle the conflict, we have \nto rely on humanistic values, sobriety, competence and \nmutual responsibility. Ukraine has extended its helping \nhand to the Syrian population by rendering assistance \nthrough United Nations mechanisms. Today, we urge \nthe entire international community to take part in that \nhumanitarian mission.\n\nWe welcome the plan produced by Russia and \nthe United States to place the Syrian stockpiles of \nchemical weapons under the control of the international \ncommunity for their subsequent destruction. At the \nsame time, Ukraine is convinced that the successful \nimplementation of that plan would give hope for that \nconflict to be brought under control and leave space for a \npolitical and diplomatic settlement. It is time to promote \nthe establishment of as wide a platform as possible so as \nto reach, through multilateral negotiations, a political \nsolution that will make it possible to restore peace and \nstability in Syria.\n\nWith respect to pressing problems in the context \nof contemporary international security, I would like to \ndraw attention to the issue of cybersecurity, which is \nbecoming increasingly important given the development \nof the information society. Ukraine attaches great \nsignificance to that issue as well as to the development \nof up-to-date mechanisms to combat cybercrimes.\n\nWe believe that we should focus on strengthening \ncontrol over the use of the Internet and cyberspace for \ncriminal purposes and for other dangerous, primarily \nmilitary ends. I am convinced that this process should \nbe led by the United Nations. The United Nations is \nthe best instrument for transforming the Internet into a \nspace of freedom that works in the interests and to the \nbenefit of all nations throughout the world.\n\nI believe that it is within our power to make the world \nsafer. The ideals of peace and the peaceful coexistence \nof nations are not hollow words for Ukraine but a clear \nguideline that has informed all of our actions on the \ninternational stage since we became independent. That \nimperative is at the heart of every step and initiative \ntaken by our country in the world arena. The fact \nthat this year Ukraine holds the chairmanship of the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \n(OSCE) \u2014 the largest international regional forum \u2014 is \na vivid example of that commitment. It is an honour \nfor us, and we view our responsible mission primarily \nas a mechanism for the consolidation of security and \nstability in Europe. \n\nThe Ukrainian chairmanship focuses in particular \non the settlement of protracted conflicts and the \nresumption of control over conventional weapons \nwithin the OSCE area, the combat against trafficking \nin human beings and other very pressing issues on the \nOrganization\u2019s agenda. I wish to underline that in every \nsector I have mentioned, some limited but practically \nmeaningful progress has been achieved.\n\nUkraine has also been able to give added urgency \nto the issues of energy security and environmental \nsafety issues for the OSCE and take the issue of energy \nefficiency to a new level. I am confident that the \nsuccessful realization of the priorities of the Ukrainian \nchairmanship will allow for the intensifying of \ncooperation between the United Nations and the OSCE.\n\nThe year 2014 will mark the twentieth anniversary \nof Ukraine\u2019s accession to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a non-nuclear-\nweapon State. By ridding the world of its third-largest \nnuclear arsenal, our country made an unprecedented \ncontribution to global nuclear disarmament. It was at \nthat time that Ukraine, the Russian Federation, Great \nBritain and the United States concluded the Budapest \nMemorandum on Security Assurances, joined later by \nFrance and China.\n\nIn view of the historical significance of those \nevents and considering the recent alarming trends in \nnuclear proliferation, Ukraine will initiate the holding, \nat the current session of the General Assembly, of a \nthematic conference. We expect that guarantor States, \ncountries that followed Ukraine\u2019s example and other \ninterested parties will participate. I hope that this \ninternational event will be a good opportunity to come \nback to the issue of negative security assurances and \ngive it thorough consideration.\n\n\n\f\nWe stress that security assurances for those States \nthat gave up their nuclear arsenals and countries that \nare not part of military unions must be reflected in a \nlegally binding international document.\n\nWe look forward to the holding of a successful \nNuclear Security Summit in The Hague next year. \nUkraine looks to that global forum to produce new \nqualitative outcomes and encourages all other countries \nto make appropriate contributions to that cause.\n\nUkraine, as a maritime State, deploys continuing \nefforts to secure maritime navigation safety and to \ncombat piracy at sea. The primary task in that field is to \nreinforce the efficacy of mechanisms for the prosecution \nof those guilty of perpetrating and financing piracy. \n\nWe will further contribute to the strengthening of \npeace through our active participation in United Nations \nmissions in hotspots throughout the world. In its more \nthan 20 years of participation in peacekeeping activities \nunder the auspices of the United Nations, Ukraine has \ncontributed to more than 20 such operations. Today \nits agenda includes the consolidation and expansion \nof that experience in the context of the United Nations \nmissions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and \nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nAt the same time, we cannot but take note of \nthe existing problems with respect to the current \npeacekeeping activities of our Organization. Along with \nother countries that are contributors of Blue Helmets, \nwe will continue to work to solve them, particularly as \nregards ensuring the mobility and safety of air operations \nas well as the legal protection of peacekeepers and the \ninvestigation of crimes committed against them.\n\nUkraine will make further significant practical \ncontributions aimed at making the world safer. To that \nend, we will use all available instruments, especially \nnon-permanent membership in the Security Council if \nour country is elected to that body for the period 2016-\n2017. I count on support for the candidacy of Ukraine \nin those elections.\n\nOur country is fully committed to the collective \nsecurity system enshrined in the Charter of the United \nNations. The system, which has proved indispensable, \nwill remain the foundation of the world order.\n\nUkraine upholds President Ashe\u2019s decisive \ndetermination to achieve long-expected practical \nadvances in the reform of the United Nations. We \nbelieve that it is critically important to achieve early \nprogress in the modernization of the Security Council. \nWe have great concern about the present stagnancy of \nthe process.\n\nI would like to confirm once again the readiness \nof Ukraine to discuss all progressive concepts related \nto Security Council reform that could accelerate the \nimplementation of the long-overdue changes. We \nconsider that such reform must take into account the \nlegitimate interests of all regional groups, including the \nEastern European group. The countries of our region \nshould be allocated one additional non-permanent seat \nin an enlarged Security Council.\n\nAll preconditions have been met for the sixty-\neighth session of the General Assembly to go down in \nhistory as one of the most fruitful in terms of the work \nof the United Nations, a key political body that is the \nmost representative of all world organizations. I am \nfirmly convinced that the community of nations is up \nto the task. \n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of \nthe delegation of the Kingdom of Thailand, allow me \nto congratulate the Honourable Mr. John Ashe on his \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-eighth session. My delegation stands ready to \nrender our full support and cooperation.\n\nI would also like to express our appreciation \nto the outgoing President, Mr. Vuk Jeremi., for his \nexceptional leadership during the previous session. \nI am particularly grateful for his contributions to the \nsecond Asia-Pacific Water Summit, held in Chiang \nMai, Thailand, earlier this year.\n\nThailand is committed to the United Nations. \nOur faith in the principles and values it stands for has \nnever wavered. The United Nations three pillars of \nsecurity, development and human rights continue to \n\n\n\f\ninspire and motivate us. When the 50 founding States \ncame together in San Francisco in 1945, the world had \nhigh hopes for the United Nations. The United Nations \nwas created in response to the demands of a different \ntime, after millions of lives had been lost in a conflict \nbetween States. Today, it is conflict within States that \ntakes the heaviest human toll, as we have witnessed in \nthe unfolding events in Syria.\n\nAs we look ahead to the post-2015 future, we must \nnot shy away from asking the hard questions. We must \nask ourselves whether multilateralism has lived up to our \nexpectations, be it in security, trade or the environment. \nWe must ask how we Member States can do better in the \nface of critical challenges. That is because ultimately, \nthe success of the United Nations depends on all of us. \nWith such a diversity of viewpoints, it is all the more \nimportant for us to work together to find the unity and \nconsensus we need. \n\nThe challenges facing us are particularly clear \nin the case of Syria. On 21 August, we learned that \nchemical weapons had been used against innocent \ncivilians in Syria. Despite widespread condemnation \nand outrage, the United Nations was initially unable \nto act and the Security Council was deadlocked. We \ntherefore welcome resolution 2118 (2013) on Syria, \nadopted yesterday by the Security Council. We urge \nSyria to ensure the full and effective implementation of \nthe resolution, and to allow monitoring and enforcement \nby the international community. It is our hope that the \nSecurity Council, especially its permanent members, \nwill continue to work to find a durable political solution \nfor the sake of the Syrian people.\n\nIn setting the stage for the post-2015 development \nagenda, we must recognize that development cannot \ntake root without peace, security, democracy and \nhuman rights. The three pillars of the United Nations \nmust be developed together and nurtured together. To \nstrengthen the United Nations, we need to seek ways to \nachieve unity and consensus on the issues that matter \nmost. In the area of security, this means thinking of \nnew, creative ways to respond to the changing threats. \nFor instance, when States fail to protect their own \npopulations, or even cause them harm, all our words \nwill amount to little unless matched with action.\n\nBut what kind of action would make the most \ndifference on the ground? When and how is it most \neffective? There are no simple answers. It is on such \nissues that the world looks to the Security Council for \nleadership. Too often, however, the Council is paralysed \njust when action is most needed. Overcoming deadlock \nand achieving consensus must be a central objective of \nSecurity Council reform.\n\n\nThe United Nations is, of course, much more than the \nSecurity Council. Unity and consensus are also needed \non development. Thailand believes that sustainable \ndevelopment must be at the heart of the United Nations \nagenda. The world has made great strides in tackling \npoverty and hunger, thanks in no small part to the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), but all of \nus still need to make a final push on the MDGs. That \nwould enable us to tackle the deep-rooted poverty that \nstill afflicts the so-called bottom billion.\n\nFollowing the MDGs, the post-2015 development \nagenda must provide both continuity and a new source \nof hope. To build on the MDGs, Thailand believes \nthat we should place special emphasis on the needs of \nthe most vulnerable countries. That includes conflict \nand post-conflict societies, as well as those of least \ndeveloped countries, landlocked developing countries \nand small island developing States. If we fail to do so, \nmillions will be left behind.\n\nThe most pressing challenge to sustainable \ndevelopment that demands our concerted action is \nclimate change. For a number of countries, particularly \nsmall island developing States, climate change strikes \nat the very heart of survival. For much of the world, \nclimate change is also linked to another important \nchallenge \u2014 food security. Extreme weather can cause \ngreat damage to agriculture. The impact will be felt \nnot only in food-producing countries, but worldwide. \nThat is why we need to work together to put in place \nsystems \u2014 better weather prediction technology, \nbetter storage silos and more resilient strains of staple \ncrops \u2014 that will mitigate the impact of climate change. \nThose are areas where countries should help one another \nby sharing their experiences and know-how. \n\nThailand believes that, if development is to be \nsustainable, it must be people-centred. We welcome \nthe Secretary-General\u2019s report \u201cA life of dignity for \nall: accelerating progress towards the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and advancing the United Nations \ndevelopment agenda beyond 2015\u201d (A/68/202), which \nputs people at the centre of the development agenda. \nPeople need to be given the chance and the tools to \nmake the most of their potential. This can happen if we \n\n\n\f\nfocus more on promoting human security, for instance \nthrough education and health care. On education, we \nbelieve that the Secretary-General\u2019s Global Education \nFirst Initiative is an important contribution to the post-\n2015 development agenda and deserves the support of \nall stakeholders. Health is also very much a development \nissue. When people are unhealthy, it imposes a cost on \nState finances and can even undo development gains.\n\nAs we look to the post-20l5 future, we must not \nlimit our goals to specific health challenges. We should \nnow set our sights on the more general objective of \nuniversal health care. Initiated by the administration \nof former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra 10 years \nago, Thailand has been implementing a programme \nthat charges only $1 per doctor\u2019s visit. This universal \nhealth-care scheme is universal in its coverage of \ntreatments, ranging from common illnesses and \nchronic diseases to lifesaving surgeries. Statistics have \nshown that through this programme, around 300,000 \nhouseholds have been saved from falling into poverty. \nEven non-Thai nationals, especially migrant workers \nfrom neighbouring countries are also benefiting from \nuniversal health care, making it truly universal. \n\nThe socioeconomic impact of this programme has \ntherefore been tremendous. Those who benefit most \nfrom our universal health care have been the poor \nand the vulnerable. By working to empower the most \nvulnerable among us, we ensure that development \nis more inclusive. We believe that the model could \nbe adapted to other developing countries, and we are \nwilling to share the lessons we have learned from our \nexperience.\n\nWe also believe that women, children, the elderly \nand persons with disabilities must be treated fairly and \nencouraged to participate fully in all aspects of life. \nParticularly in situations of conflict, vulnerable groups \nare often at the greatest risk of violence. We therefore \nsupport the United Nations initiative to end sexual \nviolence in conflict. We also commend the United \nKingdom for its leadership in realizing the Declaration \nof Commitment on this important issue.\n\nTo provide an environment that facilitates unity \nand consensus, the international community must \nalso forge a new global partnership. This new global \npartnership must rest on a common agenda for action. It \nwill need to involve States \u2014 in particular like-minded \nStates \u2014 the United Nations, regional organizations, \ncivil society and other stakeholders. In South-East \nAsia, the process is well under way. The Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations is strengthening its partnership \nto become a community of over 600 million people by \nthe end of 2015. Regional discussions on the post-2015 \nagenda are also complementing ongoing global efforts. \nAs a moderate, medium-sized country with an open \nsociety, Thailand is ready to work with all countries \nand partners. We want to do our part in helping \nbridge the gaps in communication, understanding and \nopportunity.\n\nThat is why we have put forward our candidacies to \nthe Security Council for the term 2017-2018 and to the \nHuman Rights Council for the term 2015-2017. We are \nkeen to help build bridges to connect all stakeholders \nin a more cohesive, action-oriented global partnership. \nBuilding a global partnership means forging a common \nagenda for action on our most important challenges. It \nmeans reaching out beyond our borders, beyond our \nregion and beyond our comfort zone.\n\nThailand has been building bridges not only within \nAsia, but also with Africa and Latin America. We \nbelieve that developing countries everywhere need \nto come together in a spirit of partnership to make \ntheir voices heard. What is more, that same sense of \npartnership must also cross the development divide, \nembracing developed and developing economies alike.\n\nSince the beginning, the United Nations has been \na force for good. As its membership has grown and \nthe issues have become more complex, we have now \nreached a crossroads. Whether the United Nations takes \nthe right path rests on our ability to achieve consensus \nand to act together in a meaningful manner. Now is \nthe time for us to set aside our outdated assumptions \nand our differences. Our common future depends on \nour ability to come together to forge consensus on the \nnew realities before us. The way forward is not through \npolitics as usual, but through constructive dialogue and \nmutual respect. With goodwill and common purpose, \nthe international community can once again rise to the \nchallenge. Together, we can fulfil the promise of the \nOrganization and the loftiest goals toward which we, \nthe Member States, have always aspired.\n"

Those events \nalso represent the conclusion of a long transition \ntowards democracy in Paraguay. For the second, time \nin our history, executive authority was consecutively \ntransferred from one political party to another with full \nrespect for the constitutional framework. That is no \nsmall achievement in our 202 years of independence, \nand it signals the true beginning of a new historic and \nauspicious period for my country.\n\nRepublican institutionalism, the building of \nconsensus, the strengthening of the democratic system, \nunconditional respect for human rights, and freedom \nof speech and of the press are the cornerstones of \nmy Government, which aims to be an exemplar of \npatriotism, honesty, inclusion and effectiveness, with \nthe capacity needed to propel Paraguay towards its \ndestined greatness.\n\nThe people of Paraguay have been waiting for a \ngreat Government for a long time. I hope to be able \nto deliver on that great vision, which will position my \ncountry firmly on the global stage, where we want to \nstand out by ensuring that we are a land of opportunity \nfor Paraguayans and foreigners alike. As has been said, \nParaguay is one of the most closely guarded treasures \nof Latin America, and there are good reasons to hope \nthat it will have a promising future.\n\nI have made combating poverty a priority for my \nGovernment. It is incomprehensible that a nation so rich \nin resources should have so many poor. We will give no \nquarter in the fight to reduce our poverty indicators as \nmuch and as quickly as possible. Change is coming, and \nnot through aid but by ensuring human dignity. Social \ninvestment is at the forefront of my Administration\u2019s \nagenda. That is the new direction we want to take in \nmy country, with investment that is for the people, so \nthat they may live in dignity and become the engine of \nour development, and, better still, so that the general \nwelfare of the people can become the firm basis of our \ndemocracy.\n\nMy Government has also committed to a policy of \nzero tolerance for corruption and an end to impunity. \nWe expect to face that challenge with the firm support \nof the judiciary and the Office of the Attorney General.\n\nParaguay\u2019s economy has enviable numbers. We \nare the only country in the region that has not altered \nits currency, the guaran\u00ed, since it was first introduced \nin 1943. Our macroeconomic indicators are more than \n\n\n\f\nencouraging. Paraguay is clearly suited to investment. \nNature has endowed my country with an enviable \nclimate, more than 90 rivers, abundant and fertile \nsoil and clean, renewable energy generated by three \nhydroelectric power plants. One, Acaray, is entirely \nParaguayan-owned, while Itaipu and Yacyret\u00e1 are \nco-owned with Brazil and Argentina, respectively. The \nlatter are among the largest hydroelectric plants in the \nworld. We have one of the world\u2019s largest freshwater \nreserves, the Guaran\u00ed Aquifer, a great part of which lies \nbeneath Paraguayan territory.\n\nApart from the advantages of nature and abundant, \nclean and renewable energy, the majority of Paraguay\u2019s \npopulation is young, with more than 75 per cent under \nthe age of 30. Our tax system is favourable to investment \nand our economic growth clearly exceeds the average \nfor the region. My Government is committed to \nensuring legal security, with clear and transparent rules \nfor safeguarding people and their property.\n\nToday we are a country with a revitalized economy \nand a focus on efficiency, transparency and a reliable \npublic administration. A few weeks ago I was present \nin our Congress at the signing of an agreement for \nParaguay, whereby the political parties represented \nin the legislature, along with other social institutions, \ncommitted to working together on framework \nagreements and plans of action to strengthen governance \nand attain material and spiritual goals for the people\u2019s \nwelfare. In that way, we are seeking to maintain the \ngeneral good over that of the individual. We do that \nthrough dialogue, which is the main instrument of \ndemocracy. Together, we assume the responsibility of \nmaking Paraguay a country of opportunity for all.\n\nAfter visiting countries in Europe and the Americas \nrecently, I reflect on the great challenge posed by the \nperception of my country beyond its borders. I have seen \nwith satisfaction the respect, admiration and interest \nthat Paraguay and its enormous potential give rise to. \nJust as it is our responsibility as Paraguayans to build \npredictability and reliability, it is for the branches of the \nGovernment to provide the legal security necessary for \nParaguay\u2019s overdue progress.\n\nI would like to underline my Government\u2019s \ncommitment to the defence and promotion of human \nrights, which in Paraguay are fully acknowledged in \nthe Constitution. We assume that stance out of genuine \nconviction, while my country is also a respectful \nsignatory of recognized international instruments in \nthat field.\n\nThe demands of landlocked developing countries \nlike Paraguay must be adequately addressed. Apart \nfrom that, my Government is committed to overcome the \ndisadvantages posed by our inland status, making our \ngeographic position an advantage in communications, \nlogistics and infrastructure that connects the world\u2019s \nzones and regions through Paraguayan territory. In a \nmanner similar to that in which an old border dispute \nbetween Paraguay and Brazil finally gave way to what \ntoday is Itaipu, transforming a problem into a majestic \nwork of integration and development, we hope that \nour landlocked position in the heart of Latin America \nwill serve as a development hub for Paraguay and its \nneighbours.\n\nOn the international level, I cannot avoid mentioning \nthe upheavals that disturb our times. Economic crises, \nfinancial disasters, civil wars and the use of weapons \nof mass destruction cloud the horizons of great regions \nof the planet. \n\nThe events in Syria are a concern for all of us, and \nthe United Nations must play a pre-eminent role in \nfinding a definitive solution to the conflict affecting \nthat country. In that regard, my country calls for \nsupporting the implementation of the framework \nagreement between the United States and the Russian \nFederation.\n\nMy Government has observed with satisfaction \nthat the Republic of China on Taiwan has achieved a \ngreater presence in the specialized agencies and bodies \nof the United Nations, thanks to solid international \nsupport and a rapprochement between both parties \non the Taiwan Strait. My Government will continue \nto encourage the positive interaction between the two \nsides of the Taiwan Strait in the international sphere.\n\nThe calm and determination of the nations and the \norganizations able to help in conflict resolution are \nmore necessary than ever. Paraguay encourages peace, \ndialogue and development in harmony with the other \ncountries and the world, promoting an integration that \nis respectful of the rule of law, the dignity of nations and \nthe asymmetries. Integration is a phenomenon that in \nthis global era cannot be halted. Paraguay understands \nand promotes integration in conditions of equality as \na means for supranational insertion, but under fair \nconditions and looking towards a common future, not \nas a simple courting of Powers or being a silent guest \n\n\n\f\nin global forums that are discussing the future of our \npeoples.\n\nParaguay\u2019s contribution is essential in today\u2019s \nintegrated reality and is indissolublely linked to our \ndignity as a free nation, sovereign and independent, \nunder the premise of the right to the self-determination \nof peoples and the principles of non-intervention and \nthe legal equality of States. The true destiny of the \npeople of Paraguay is to become a prosperous nation, \nliving in social peace, liberty, justice and equality. \nMy management of the Government is geared towards \ncreating and strengthening an environment suited to \nthe unlimited opportunities that my country offers for \nall Paraguayans and for foreigners who have chosen \nit. I have realized that my people neither want nor \nseek handouts, but opportunities to achieve dignity \nthrough work and study. My country therefore today \npresents itself to the world as a land of opportunities \nfor investment and prosperity, with security, formality, \nreliability and predictability.\n\nOn this occasion, I cannot fail to mention a key \nissue \u2014 education. Traditional political discourse has \nsignificantly undermined certain core ideas that my \nGovernment intends to definitively turn into a reality. \nMuch has been said about the need for education, \nsecurity and health, but little has been done in that \nregard. Improving education in Paraguay, in terms of \nquantity and quality, is a fundamental premise of my \nGovernment. \n\nToday more than ever before, the great change \nthat must take place in Paraguay and the opening of \na wide window of opportunity depend on an efficient \nand inclusive educational system. Institutions of public \neducation should rethink their role in society and assume \nan unprecedented role as a breeding ground for leaders \nfor a new Paraguay, with a skilled workforce adapted to \nthis millennium, in an interconnected world where those \nwho possess more knowledge, information and abilities \nare more likely to find more and better opportunities \nfor work, well-being and personal advancement. Those \ncountries that emphasized education from the beginning \nare proud of their results. There is a clear and direct \nrelationship between education and development. \n\nEducation is therefore key. The issue is rooted \nin the quality of training and is the key to escaping \ngeopolitical shakles, backwardness and a lack of \nopportunities. For my country, the new rules that \ngovern the world therefore represent an access to the \nocean of development.\n\nSpeaking before the Assembly and the world for the \nfirst time as President of the Republic of Paraguay, I \npresent the new direction that the Paraguayan people \nfreely and sovereignly chose on 21 April. I belong to \na nation whose children have contributed to history \nwith their prowess and boundless sacrifice, such as \nthe supreme sacrifice by our greatest hero, Francisco \nSolano L\u00f3pez, Field Marshal and President of the \nRepublic, who decided to give his life, sword in hand, \nfighting on the front lines with his last soldiers, rather \nthan see his homeland humiliated. I have decided to \ndevote myself to the service of Paraguay and to bring \nabout the real change that my country demands, which \nis to return to the path of the true Paraguayan destiny \nof peace, development and modernity, and to grow in \nharmony with all nations of the world, particularly with \nour neighbours.\n\nI assure the General Assembly that my country is \na very generous and attractive place. I invite the world \nto learn more about Paraguay, to discover the treasure \nthat pulses in the heart of America, ready to write anew \nthe most glorious pages in its history, today in peace \nand social and economic development, with dignity and \nreadiness to welcome all those who wish to share in our \ngreat destiny.\n\nWe Heads of State are transients in Government. \nHistory will judge us for what we have done for our \npeoples and will sternly hold us accountable for what \nwe have failed to do. To honour the trust and hope of my \npeople, I have decided to commit myself wholly to the \nservice of my homeland and to do everything necessary \nfor its greatness and prosperity.\n\nParaguay considers it necessary, more than ever \nbefore, to give greater impetus to the negotiating \nprocess between Israel and Palestine in order to attain a \nlasting peace, so that Israel and Palestine can live side \nby side with secure borders and in peace. \n\nAs a final comment, I wish to convey my most \nsincere condolences to the people of Kenya for the \ncasualties that resulted from the terrorist attack, an act \nthat we most vigorously condemn.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like first to \ncongratulate the President of the General Assembly \non his election to that important position and express \nmy confidence in his leadership. It is also my great \npleasure to address the Assembly for the first time as \nthe President of the newest European Union member \nState.\n\nOur debate this year is focused on an issue of \nparamount importance for our planet\u2019s future \u2014 the \npost-2015 development agenda. However, before sharing \nmy views on that central issue, I would like to share my \nthoughts on a broader understanding of sustainability. \nIt is difficult, if not impossible, to outline sustainable \ndevelopment without touching upon one of its \nessential prerequisites: peace and security. As a global \ncommunity, we continue to witness, year after year, a \nplethora of deadly and prolonged international crises \nand new and emerging threats and conflicts. \n\nThe ongoing security and humanitarian catastrophe \nin Syria, with all its terrible effects and potential to \ndestabilize the region, is naturally foremost on our \nminds. We are saddened by the tremendous loss of life \nas a result of that ongoing conflict. We are particularly \nappalled and concerned by the findings and conclusions \nof the report of the United Nations Mission to Investigate \nAllegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons in the \nSyrian Arab Republic on the alleged use of chemical \nweapons in the Ghouta area of Damascus on 21 August \n2013 (A/67/997). Croatia condemns in the strongest \nterms the use of chemical weapons. The international \ncommunity must ensure that there is no impunity for \nsuch crimes and that the perpetrators of those and \nother crimes are held to account. In that connection, \nwe welcome the United States-Russia Framework \nfor Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons of \n14 September. The priority must now be to provide \nfor its prompt and full implementation, starting with a \nprocess in the Security Council and the soonest possible \nadoption of a relevant Council resolution.\n\nThe United Nations was established at a time when \nthe world was emerging from a period that had witnessed \nthe worst atrocities of the twentieth century. In fact, it \nwas established for the very purpose of ensuring that \nsuch atrocities would not happen again. While we can \n\n\f\nand often do debate the overall effectiveness of the \nUnited Nations in ensuring international peace, it is \nimportant that we build on the lessons learned from \nboth past successes and past mistakes.\n\nIn that connection, allow me to highlight one such \npast success. January this year marked the fifteenth \nanniversary of the end of the mandate of the United \nNations Transitional Administration for Eastern \nSlavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium in Croatia. It is \nconsidered to be one of the most successful peacekeeping \noperations in United Nations history. The mission \nwas able to peacefully reaffirm the independence, \nsovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of \nCroatia, and paved the way for normalizing relations \nand cooperation in the region.\n\nOver the past 20 years Croatia has undertaken a \nlong and demanding journey from being a host nation \nfor a number of United Nations peacekeeping missions \non its territory to a peacekeeping contributor. Today, we \nare determined to continue our participation in many \ncurrent peacekeeping and peace-support operations \nand missions around the world. This year also marks \nthe twentieth anniversary of the establishment of the \nInternational Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia \n(ICTY). It is a well-known fact that Croatia advocated \nthe establishment of the ICTY from the very beginning.\n\nWe wholeheartedly supported the strong \ndetermination of the international community to finally, \nonce and for all, put an end to the culture of impunity \nthat had for so long accompanied wars and armed \nconflicts. The establishment of the ad hoc criminal \ntribunals changed the landscape of international \ncriminal justice and paved the way for a whole new \nsystem, with the International Criminal Court at its \nhead. The establishment of the International Criminal \nCourt in 1998 can be regarded as one of the most \nimportant civilization achievements in the last century \nand the beginning of a new era of accountability. That \nis why we are calling on those countries that have not \nyet decided to adopt the Rome Statute to do so as soon \nas possible.\n\nOur own experience teaches us that peace often \ncomes at a high price. Maintaining peace often entails a \nlong-term and comprehensive commitment on the part \nof the international community. The United Nations \nrecognized that fact in establishing the Peacebuilding \nCommission (PBC) in 2005. Its aim is to direct and \nsustain the attention and efforts of the international \ncommunity in post-conflict countries. Croatia\u2019s interest \nand engagement in peacebuilding started some time ago \nand was further strengthened by our bitter experience \nin recent history. From the very beginning, Croatia \nactively participated in and contributed to the work of \nthe Peacebuilding Commission.\n\nIn the PBC we have focused on three different, yet \nmutually reinforcing areas \u2013 strengthening security, \nstimulating socioeconomic prosperity and promoting \nhuman rights and gender equality. For example, as the \ncurrent PBC Chair and in line with the Peacebuilding \nCommission\u2019s action plan for 2013, Croatia helped \norganize a joint meeting of the PBC and the Global \nCompact on the important topic of business for \npeacebuilding, which was held in June. Earlier today, \nCroatia, as PBC Chair and in cooperation with UN-\nWomen, organized a high-level ministerial meeting \non women\u2019s economic empowerment in peacebuilding. \nThe meeting emphasized the critical role of women in \npeacebuilding processes and the fact that empowering \nwomen in the economy is essential for realizing women\u2019s \nrights and achieving broader development goals.\n\nIn our view, progress in the areas of security, \ndevelopment, the rule of law and human rights must go \nhand in hand. We would especially like to stress the \ncritical importance that the rule of law plays in post-\nconflict peacebuilding and, therefore, in achieving \nlasting peace and sustainable development.\n\nFor its part, Croatia continues to follow the path \nof promoting an open and pluralistic democracy as \nthe best guarantee for safeguarding the human rights \nof its citizens. We believe that democracy needs to be \napproached in a holistic manner. Human and minority \nrights, the rule of law, good governance and the fight \nagainst corruption are intrinsic to democratic values. \nDemocracy is not only about civil and political rights; \nits focus is not only on free and fair elections, but also \non economic, social and cultural rights.\n\nCroatia will continue to seek the upholding \nof human rights standards across the globe. We \nparticularly support the abolition of the death penalty, \nthe implementation of anti-discrimination policies, the \neffective and full protection of the rights of the child and \nthe realization of the rights of persons with disabilities. \nWe will also spare no effort in raising awareness \nabout the importance of upholding and improving \nwomen\u2019s and minority rights. Croatia fully supports \nthe pivotal role of the United Nations and its human \n\n\n\f\nrights mechanisms, in particular the Human Rights \nCouncil. For that reason, Croatia has presented its bid \nfor membership in the Human Rights Council for the \nperiod of 2017-2019, remaining committed to making \nan active and substantial contribution to the activities \nand efforts of that very important United Nations body.\n\nIn the area of security, we consider the prevention \nof the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \nespecially proliferation to non-State actors, to be a \nglobal security priority. Croatia believes that successful \nnon-proliferation is possible only through a combination \nof diligent work at the national level and the widest \npossible international cooperation. We firmly believe \nthat adherence to multilateral non-proliferation treaties, \nas well as participation in informal non-proliferation \ninitiatives, are an indispensable part of non-proliferation \nefforts. The most recent events in Syria are a horrible \nreminder and warning of how important it is that all \ninternational agreements on non-proliferation be \nuniversally complied with.\n\nCroatia is also very concerned about the issue of the \nuncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons \nand their excessive accumulation. We believe that those \nweapons present a great risk for the stability and security \nof many weak and fragile areas around the world. A \nmilestone in that area is the successful completion and \nopening for signature of the international Arms Trade \nTreaty, a uniquely drafted document establishing rules \nand criteria for trade in conventional arms. Croatia, as \nan original signatory State, would like to add its voice \nto those requesting urgent and universal adherence to \nthe treaty and its expedited entry into force.\n\nNowadays we are witnessing all around the world \nthe heavy toll of armed conflicts and wars. In any \nhumanitarian crisis, those paying the highest price \nfor the conflict are civilians, especially women and \nchildren. We commend the efforts undertaken by the \nUnited Nations and other international donors to help \ncivilians, and we are contributing to them as much as \nwe can. \n\nHaving been an aid recipient, we have learned that \nthe donor-recipient relationship can be effective and \nefficient only if based on an equal partnership, mutual \nrespect and understanding. Development cooperation is \na multilevel process through which all sides can learn and \ngrow. Croatia will continue focusing its donor activities \non gender and child-sensitive issues, on maternal health \nand the prevention of mortality in children under 5, as \nwell as on enhancing girls\u2019 education.\n\nIn setting the stage for the post-2015 development \nagenda, we, as a global community, will continue to \nbe confronted with many challenges, some of which I \nhave just mentioned. The United Nations Conference \non Sustainable Development (Rio+20) has provided us \nwith important guidance with regard to establishing \nthe goals and multilateral architecture necessary for its \nimplementation. In that sense, we would like to express \nour satisfaction with the creation of the High-Level \nPolitical Forum, which we hope will be a stepping stone \nin the establishment of a strengthened institutional \narchitecture for sustainable development.\n\nScientists warn us that soon we will need two \nplanets to keep pace with the consumption-driven \ngrowth necessary to sustain our ever-increasing \npopulation. While we agree that a transformative shift \ntowards more sustainable development is needed, the \nquestion remains how to achieve that shift. Knowledge \nis the key. The science-policy interface, so often \nhighlighted in the run-up to the Rio+20 Conference \nand integrated into the vision of \u201cThe future we want\u201d \n(resolution 66/288, annex), stands as a crucial link to \nthose innovative solutions.\n\nTo achieve a sustainable future, we need a \nconcurrent base of strong institutions, solidarity, \njustice and social development, with an approach that is \nmore targeted towards marginalized groups, including \nwomen\u2019s empowerment, as well as a strong respect for \nthe environment and innovative growth. \n\nCroatia welcomes the already widely accepted \nview that education represents one of the main building \nblocks in every society and is a crucial driver for \ndevelopment. I am proud to represent a country among \nthe States championing the Global Education First \nInitiative. Croatia is fully committed to supporting the \nInitiative, and I would like to take this opportunity to \ncall upon others to join our efforts to give life to the \nInitiative\u2019s goals.\n\nOn 1 July, just over two and a half months ago, \nCroatia became the twenty-eighth member of the \nEuropean Union (EU). One of the primary reasons \nthat my country strove to become a full member of \nthe European Union was to secure a safe, democratic \nand stable future for ourselves and for forthcoming \ngenerations. Croatia firmly believes that EU \nenlargement has been one of that organization\u2019s most \nsuccessful and productive policies. Because of that, \nwe believe that the European project should not and \ncannot stop at our borders. We firmly believe in the \n\n\n\f\nstrategic importance of the EU\u2019s enlargement policy. \nIt must be continued with respect to all countries of \nthe Western Balkans \u2014 based on their individual \nmerits \u2014 as it is the best option for long-term stability \nin the region. We strongly support all of the countries \nin our neighbourhood in their endeavours and believe \nthat their efforts towards future membership of the \nEuropean Union will be successful.\n\nIt is important to understand that reconciliation \nand cooperation have become a new standard for \nregional policies, and in that regard, we welcome closer \ncollaboration among all countries of South-Eastern \nEurope, both bilaterally and in the framework of \nregional organizations and initiatives.\n\nBefore concluding, I would like to address the \nissue of United Nations reform. We believe that there \nis a need for true reform of the current United Nations \nstructures and mechanisms if the United Nations is to \nachieve its ambitious goals and strengthen its capacity \nto meet new challenges.\n\nThe first area is Security Council reform. Croatia \ncommends the persevering commitment of Member \nStates to the ongoing negotiating process and believes \nthat broader understanding of sustainability should \nfind its place in that context as well. However, any \nreform of the Council must not have a negative impact \non its ability to perform its main duties and meet its \nprimary responsibilities. Enlargement of the Council \nis closely connected with the reform of its working \nmethods, while the continuing veto powers of the \npermanent five continues to raise numerous questions. \nThat is why such reform must be comprehensive. \nThat having been said, it is Croatia\u2019s position that any \nenlargement should take place in both the permanent \nand the non-permanent categories of membership, with \none additional non-permanent seat reserved for the \ngroup of Eastern European States. That would more \nproperly reflect the reality of international relations in \nthe twenty-first century.\n\nAs a member of the Economic and Social Council, \nwe intend to continue advocating a stronger and more \nefficient role for that main body in its efforts to seek \nsolutions to the most significant social and economic \nchallenges of our time. The General Assembly and the \nEconomic and Social Council should also find ways \nof working together to support deliberations on the \ncomplex matter of sustainable development. Within \nits broad, overarching mandate, the General Assembly \nremains the central point for all of our discussions. \nCroatia welcomes the focus at this year\u2019s debate on the \npost-2015 development agenda.\n\nFinally, I would like to stress that we are all aware \nof the global challenges we face today. As a global \ncommunity, in looking for sustainable solutions, \nwe made strong commitments at last year\u2019s Rio+20 \nConference, and we will need to make new ones as \nwe proceed with the post-2015 development agenda. \nTo achieve all of that, we will need to strengthen \nold partnerships and create new ones, both between \nGovernments and among Governments and civil \nsociety and other key stakeholders. In that respect, it \nis our belief that the United Nations and its institutions \noffer the best chance to help meet those expectations. \nLet us, as its Member States, make the best use of all \nthat it has to offer.\n"

        "file_text": "I \nam honoured to take the floor on behalf of Gabon at \nthe sixty-eighth session of the Assembly. I warmly \ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President and \nI assure you of Gabon\u2019s full support. I also pay tribute \nto the remarkable work of your predecessor, Mr. Vuk \nJeremi., President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\nseventh session. I wish to reiterate our confidence in the \ncross-cutting work of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \nKi-moon, as well as the important organizational \nreforms undertaken.\n\nI would also like to congratulate Mr. Boubacar \nKeita of the Republic of Mali and His Excellency \nMr. Hassan Rouhani of the Islamic Republic of Iran on \ntheir elections in their respective countries. \n\nThis session has opened in a context marked by the \nterrorist attack against a shopping centre in Nairobi that \nkilled many innocent people, including children. It was \nan intolerable act and I express, here in the Hall, my \ncountry\u2019s strongest condemnation of the perpetrators. \nI also express my own and my country\u2019s deepest \ncondolences to the victims\u2019 families and the people \nof Kenya. Gabon offers its support to the Government \nof Kenya at this trying time. As a target of terrorism, \nAfrica should receive the international community\u2019s \nfull support and solidarity in its fight against the threat.\n\nPoverty fuels extremism throughout the world, \nand the fight against that scourge must remain at the \nheart of our policies. Our peoples, especially the youth, \ndemand greater socioeconomic progress from us. I \ntherefore welcome the opportunity at this session to \nset the stage for the post-2015 development agenda and \nconsider the necessary action remaining to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs \nhave provided a global solidarity pact for our countries\u2019 \nsocioeconomic development. I would like to emphasize \nhere that Gabon has achieved noteworthy progress in \npoverty reduction, food security and education. We have \nsignificantly reduced infant and maternal mortality, \nHIV/AIDS prevalence and malaria mortality. We have \nstrengthened women\u2019s participation in the political \nand economic life of the country. Despite the efforts \nmade by States, it must be recognized that some of the \nMDGs will not be achieved as expected, owing mainly \nto unfulfilled commitments and reduced funding.\n\nIn that context, Gabon draws two main conclusions: \nthe importance of strengthened governance and the \nneed for further efforts in education and health aimed \nat more equitable and inclusive growth. As members \nbegin to consider the post-2015 development agenda, I \nwish to note that Gabon seeks a post-2015 development \nagenda with a particular focus on Africa\u2019s priorities; \nit would include the unrealized MDGs among the \nfuture sustainable development goals and would take \ninto account specific issues such as energy, access to \nclean water and sustainable agriculture. My country \nalso seeks an agenda based on predictable funding \nthat combines public and private funding, innovative \nfinancing and global partnerships. That agenda should \nstimulate direct investment and increase our share of \ninternational trade. It must promote the transformation \nof our economies with a view to inclusive and \nsustainable growth.\n\nSuch an approach has led me, as the Chairman of the \nCentral African Economic and Monetary Community, \nto propose to my peers \u2014 who have accepted \u2014 the \ncreation of a fund of $200 million for the training \nand employment of young people, entitled \u201cTrain My \nGeneration\u201d. Its goal is to enhance the role of youth \nin our countries\u2019 development efforts. In that spirit, at \nthe fifth Tokyo International Conference on African \nDevelopment, I proposed to my peers that by 2020 \nAfrica should be able to convert its raw materials prior \nto exportation. Using that approach, Gabon is already \n\n\n\f\nprocessing 40 per cent of its timber locally, thereby \ndoubling employment in that sector.\n\nIn the context of the post-2015 development agenda, \nimproved assessment and monitoring of countries\u2019 \nprogress will become important. To that end, Gabon \nhas proposed a sustainable development index that will \ncombine the human development index and countries\u2019 \necological footprints.\n\nOur quest for sustainable development must also \nensure a binding climate treaty. Our best global experts \ntirelessly draw attention to global warming. The very \nexistence of some States is threatened. It is necessary \nto state that we remain prisoners of our own interests \nand climate sceptics. For its part, Gabon has assumed \nits responsibilities by implementing measures such \nas our land-use programme and our environmental \nprogramme. Can we advance towards a post-Kyoto \nagreement in 2015 through strong and courageous steps \nin the interest of future generations? That question \nshould cause greater concern. That is why I fully \nsupport the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative to convene a \nsummit on climate change in 2014.\n\nIn addition to climate, biodiversity is threatened \nby poaching and the illicit trade in protected species. \nElephants and rhinoceros are especially threatened \nowing to the illegal trade in ivory and horns. That \nphenomenon has become both an ecologic and an \neconomic challenge; it is a transnational crime that \nthreatens States\u2019 security. Along with the Federal \nRepublic of Germany and other States, we have initiated \na debate on that issue. On 26 September, here at the \nUnited Nations, an event will take place on the sidelines \nto mobilize support on the issue. We would be honoured \nby the presence and participation of members of the \nAssembly in the discussions. I also call on the United \nNations to integrate that issue into its cooperation \nefforts with the African Union. In May in Marrakech, \nMorocco, in the presence of the African Development \nBank, I proposed the creation of a trust fund aimed at \nstrengthening capacity-building in Africa and other \nefforts. \n\nClearly, sustainable development must be based \non good governance, equality, access to justice and the \nprotection of human rights and democracy. In Gabon \nwe are striving, with all national stakeholders, to \nstrengthen those areas. We are collecting biometrical \ndata in order to enhance election transparency, thus \nstrengthening democracy. Furthermore, our election \nto the current Human Rights Council is in line with \nour commitments, particularly in terms of promoting \nand protecting the rights of women and children. \nDuring this twentieth anniversary year of the Vienna \nDeclaration, Gabon will promote economic, social \nand cultural rights and seek to combat racism, hatred \nand violence throughout the world. It is on the basis \nof those commitments that Gabon will present itself \nas a candidate for the presidency of the Human Rights \nCouncil in 2014.\n\nAfrica is more hopeful for its future, but if that hope \nis to be realized throughout the continent Africa must \nbe able to resolve crises preventing its development. \nAllow me to list some crisis situations. \n\nFirst of all, in the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo, Gabon is still concerned by fighting in the \neastern part of the country, where women and children \nare paying a high price. We welcome the increased \nefforts on the part of the United Nations to implement \nSecurity Council resolution 2098 (2013) and the \ncommitments made by the parties to the Framework \nAgreement signed in Addis Ababa. All countries in the \nGreat Lakes region must support efforts by the United \nNations. We would also encourage the efforts on the \npart of the Government to ensure that elections are held \nsoon.\n\nGabon supports the transition in the Central African \nRepublic, for which we have worked with members of \nthe Economic Community of Central African States. \nWe hope that the numerous stakeholders will adhere \nstrictly to the transition framework. Nevertheless, we \nare still concerned by the humanitarian and security \nsituation in the country, as well as by the renewed \nactivities on the part of the Lord\u2019s Resistence Army. We \nwelcome the establishment of the International Support \nMission to the Central African Republic by the African \nUnion, which will take over from the Mission for the \nConsolidation of Peace in the Central African Republic. \nGabon calls for a contingency plan to be put in place for \nthe new mission. I would like to thank France, which is \nsupporting efforts on the part of the subregion to ensure \nthat peace returns to the Central African Republic.\n\nIn Mali, at the height of the crisis, Gabon responded \nto a funding appeal by the African Union, which \nwas launched to support its efforts in that country. \nWe commend the positive political change that has \ntaken place in Mali, proof of which can be seen in the \npresidential elections and the decision by the people of \n\n\n\f\nMali to elect President Keita. I would like to wish him \nall the best, and I call upon the international community \nto support the reconstruction of Mali. \n\nWith regard to Western Sahara, Gabon welcomes \nefforts to bring about dialogue and negotiations by the \nOrganization. My country would also like to reiterate \nthat it supports the Moroccan initiative for Western \nSahara, which we believe is a courageous and realistic \nproposal, one that could lead to a lasting settlement. We \ncall upon the different players to reach a constructive \nand dynamic compromise, the results of which will \nbenefit the unity of Africa. \n\nAfrica should be able to respond to new threats \nto peace and security, including transnational crime, \nthe illicit trafficking in small arms, and piracy in \nthe Gulf of Guinea, which the Atlantic coast is now \nexperiencing. Following the Summit of Heads of State \nand Government on Maritime Safety and Security in the \nGulf of Guinea, which was held in June in Yaounde, we \nadopted a strategy for combating those threats. Gabon \nis ready to make contributions towards the measures \nthat were adopted at the Summit. I also welcome \nefforts by the Security Council to address the problem, \nparticularly through resolution 2018 (2011). \n\nAfrica cannot face up to the challenges of peace and \nsecurity alone. Its efforts must be given better support, \nbecause instability in Africa will have repurcussions \nin other regions. I thank our partners, particularly \nFrance, Japan, Germany, the United States, the United \nNations and the European Union, for their significant \ncontributions towards such efforts.\n\nIn the face of those new threats, it is important for the \nUnited Nations to continue to enhance its cooperation \nwith regional African organizations. Furthermore, we \nmust ensure the implementation of the Arms Trade \nTreaty, which was the first legally binding instrument \non the matter adopted by the General Assembly, in May.\n\nIn a world stricken by tensions and crises, we \nmust continue to work towards ensuring that the \nOrganization can better fulfil its mandate in the area \nof international peace and security, with a particular \nemphasis on conflict prevention, while supporting \npeaceful resolutions to emerging crises. The crisis in \nSyria has already claimed many lives, and we have \nseen an unacceptable escalation in the form of the use \nof chemical weapons. We strongly condemn the use \nof such weapons, and Gabon calls for the destruction \nof all stockpiles of chemical weapons throughout the \nworld. With regard to the investigations being carried \nout by United Nations inspectors in Syria, we call upon \nall parties to fully cooperate. Furthermore, Gabon \nsupports all diplomatic efforts aimed at achieving a \npolitical solution that will allow us to emerge from \nthat crisis. In the event that its efforts are blocked, the \nSecurity Council must take measures.\n\nWith regard to Palestine and the State of Israel, the \npossibility of resuming talks with the impetus of the \nUnited States must be welcomed. Gabon still supports \nthe broadly accepted view of two viable States, Israel \nand Palestine, coexisting in mutual security and respect \nwithin recognized borders. \n\nWith regard to the embargo on Cuba, Gabon \nreiterates its position in favour of lifting that ban \nbecause of its negative impact on the well-being of the \nCuban population.\n\nIt is our obligation to transform our international \ninstitutions in order to make them more equipped to \nmeet current challenges. The reform of the Security \nCouncil, enhancing the role and authority of the \nGeneral Assembly and the reform of the Economic and \nSocial Council are all to be wished. It is essential for \nour common future that we assume that responsibility, \nin the spirit of the Charter. Assuring such a future calls \nupon our shared but differentiated responsibility and \nforces us to act for the well-being of humankind. On \nthe basis of those convictions, Gabon will continue to \nbe committed, within the Organization, to working for \npeace and development, which is also at the heart of the \nvision that I have proposed for the future of my own \ncountry, a future I wish for all countries.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me great pleasure at the outset \nto congratulate Mr. Ashe on his election to preside \nover the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session \nand to pay tribute to his friendly country, Antigua \nand Barbuda. I am confident that his vast diplomatic \nexperience, with which I am personally familiar, \nand thorough knowledge of international affairs will \nguarantee the smooth conduct and success of our work \nat this session.\n\nI express my gratitude and appreciation to his \npredecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremi., for his skilful and \njudicious management of the sixty-seventh session of \nthe General Assembly. I would like also to strongly \ncommend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \ntireless efforts to strengthen the United Nations and \nuphold its principles despite formidable difficulties \nand increasing challenges. We pledge our full support \nto him in his endeavours to enhance the role of the \nOrganization and its peacebuilding capacities in the \nface of such major challenges.\n\nWe extend our heartfelt condolences to the people \nand the friendly Government of Pakistan for the loss \nof hundreds of lives as a result of the earthquake that \nhit south-western Pakistan. We pray for their souls and \nextend our sympathy to their families. We condemn \nthe terrorist act that targeted a commercial centre in \nKenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi, and deeply regret the scores \nof innocent victims who lost their lives as a result of \nthat cowardly act.\n\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain firmly believes that it is \nimperative to link peace to development. That concept \nhas been acknowledged in and by all United Nations \nbodies for decades, and must now be enhanced and \nimplemented at all levels. That is why the Kingdom \nof Bahrain is working to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals by 2015, as a top priority of its \ndevelopment programme.\n\nThe most recent report of the Secretary-General on \nthe work of the Organization (A/68/1) presents us with \nan accurate and concrete portrait of global problems in \nall their complexity. Those problems require effective \nsolutions, particularly as we approach the 2015 deadline. \nIn our view, therefore, the President\u2019s choice for the \ntheme of this session, \u201cThe post-2015 development \nagenda: setting the stage\u201d, is apt and well considered, \ncalling as it does for a collective effort to attain the \ngoals we seek, based on the recommendations contained \nin the report of the High-level Panel of Eminent \nPersons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda, A New \nGlobal Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform \nEconomies through Sustainable Development, in order \nto ensure sustainable development. It also suggests the \ncreation of a monitoring mechanism, under the auspices \nof the Economic and Social Council, to follow up on \nall recommendations made by relevant conferences \non issues related to sustainable development, for the \nbenefit of future generations.\n\n\n\f\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain is located in the \nArabian Gulf, a region of vital strategic importance \nthat has been a crossroads of world civilizations \nsince time immemorial. The countries of the region \nare experiencing one of the most prosperous eras \nin their history, building a society based on justice \nand development in every dimension \u2014 political, \neconomic, social and cultural. As successive United \nNations Development Programme annual reports have \nreflected, the region ranks high on the indices of human \ndevelopment. In that regard, we reaffirm our keen desire \nto continue making steady progress in development for \nthe benefit of the peoples of our region, harnessing the \nformidable progress that has been made in information \nand communication technologies, as well as in dealing \nwith issues pertaining to security, environment, natural \nresources and population.\n\nAs a vital part of the world, our region seeks to \nconsolidate a new concept of regional security that \nemphasizes the region\u2019s geopolitical situation and \nconsiders security in relation to humanitarian needs, \nfood and water. It also considers security in the context \nof existing coalitions that link the region to friendly \ncountries through strategic and historic agreements \nthat emphasize human, food and water security and that \nare designed to reinforce stability, enhance dialogue \nand promote a culture of peace, friendship and mutual \nrespect.\n\nWe in the Kingdom of Bahrain and the other \nGulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have \ndesignated three important strategic pillars that guide \nour interaction with one another and help us to make \nprogress, build healthy and sustainable relations with \nour neighbours, engage with the world at large and \nrespond to new developments and challenges. Those \npillars are axes for the world politics of today on a planet \ncharacterized by globalization and fruitful cooperation \nbetween its nations. In our view, therefore, the first \npillar is regional partnership in the field of security, \namong ourselves and with our world partners. We \nin the GCC system work together to preserve our \nshared stability and security within a framework of \ncoordination, cooperation and complementarity that \nresults in the unity we seek. Our partnerships extend \nacross the Arab and Islamic world. Here in the United \nNations we continue to pursue such partnerships in \nthe cause of maintaining world peace and security. We \nfind political and economic solutions to many global \nproblems within a multilateral cooperative framework \nthat encompasses other strategic partnerships through \ndialogue with political Powers and economic groups \nsuch as the United States, the United Kingdom, the \nEuropean Union, the Russian Federation, China, Japan, \nIndia and the member States of the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations, with a view to playing an active \nrole in consolidating the principles of international \ncooperation and friendly relations between nations and \npeoples.\n\nIn that context, our principal goal is to spare \nhumankind the scourges of war, conflict and disasters. \nWe therefore call for the establishment in the Middle \nEast, including the Arabian Gulf region, of a zone free \nof weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear \nweapons, and for compliance with the criteria and \nsafeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency, \nespecially those related to nuclear safety. In that regard, \nwe support the efforts of the five permanent members \nof the Security Council and Germany to work with the \nIslamic Republic of Iran to reach a swift settlement \nof the issue of the Iranian nuclear programme issue, \nin accordance with the provisions of the Treaty on \nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, while \nguaranteeing the right of all States to enjoy the fruits \nof nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. We \nreiterate the importance of convening an international \nconference on establishing a zone free of weapons \nof mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, \nin the Middle East, originally proposed for 2012, in \naccordance with the resolution adopted at the May 2010 \nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\n\nConsistent with the principles and purposes we all \nendeavour to uphold in the context of our cooperation \nwith the United Nations in order to improve stability \nin sensitive regions, we reaffirm our utter rejection \nof terrorism, extremism and violence in all their \nmanifestations and forms, irrespective of their reasons, \nmotives, justifications or sources. We also condemn \nall terrorist acts that threaten regional peace and \nstability, and noted the need to add groups such as the \nLebanese Hizbullah to the list of international terrorist \norganizations, in view of their criminal acts aimed at \nterrorizing peaceful civilians and creating instability \nand chaos.\n\nWe are committed to seeking peace, cooperation and \nsecurity for our countries, within the framework of both \ninternational and regional structures and organizations \nby cooperating with our allies from other friendly \n\n\n\f\ncountries to ensure freedom of maritime navigation \nin the Arabian Gulf and to protect commercial vessels \nfrom piracy off the coast of Somalia and the Horn of \nAfrica and in the Gulf of Aden. We also contribute to \npeacekeeping and stabilization efforts in Afghanistan.\n\nWe stand by the sisterly Arab Republic of Egypt \nand support its efforts to achieve stability and security, \nrightfully defend its vital interests, implement a road \nmap that can lead it to safety and propose clear steps to \nmeet the aspirations of the Egyptian people and restore \nEgypt\u2019s leading role in the Middle East.\n\nWe also reiterate our principled position of \nunwavering support for and solidarity with the sisterly \nKingdom of Morocco regarding its territorial integrity \nand a settlement of the Western Sahara problem, \nin accordance with the relevant Security Council \nresolutions.\n\nThe second of our three strategic pillars encompasses \nsupport for the principles of good-neighbourliness, \nnon-intervention in the internal affairs of others, \nabiding by the provisions of international law and its \ninstruments and peaceful coexistence. We are also \neager to take advantage of opportunities to put those \nprinciples into practice, in responding to the challenges \nwe face and transforming them into opportunities to \nprotect the region from tensions, threats and instability.\n\nThe first of those challenges is the important task \nof putting an end to Iranian intervention in the internal \naffairs of the countries of the region and to its occupation \nof the three Emirates islands of Greater Tunb, Lesser \nTunb and Abu Musa. We ask that the repeated calls of \nthe sisterly United Arab Emirates for a just solution to \nthat question be heeded, either through serious direct \nnegotiations between the two countries or by referral \nto the International Court of Justice for arbitration, in \nconformity with the Charter of the United Nations and \nthe provisions of international law. In the face of that \nchallenge, we look forward to new, clear and positive \nstatements and initiatives from the Islamic Republic of \nIran that can help to end the tensions and instability \nin the region and contribute to confidence-building, \ncooperation and the establishment of friendly relations \nbased on good-neighbourliness and mutual interests.\n\nThe second challenge concerns the Palestinian \nquestion, and the need to arrive at a just, permanent and \ncomprehensive solution that guarantees the legitimate \nrights of the Palestinian people. That challenge has led \nto an important opportunity, the Arab Peace Initiative, \nlaunched by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, \nKing Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud of Saudi \nArabia, and endorsed at the Arab Summit in Beirut in \n2002. We still believe that that initiative presents an \nimportant opportunity to secure peace, security and \na bright future for the Palestinian and Israeli peoples \non the basis of coexistence, cooperation and good \nneighbourliness between the Arab States and Israel.\n\nWe look forward to overcoming wars and \nanimosity. For centuries Arabs, Muslims, Christians \nand Jews lived side by side in the region and forged \ntheir common history in a framework of coexistence \nand tolerance based on mutual respect for each other\u2019s \nbeliefs, culture and religion. The Arab Peace Initiative \nstipulates that the Palestinian people must enjoy all \nthe full and legitimate rights enjoyed by other peoples \nof the world. It reaches out to the Israeli people with \nguarantees of security designed to reassure them \nagainst any threat or danger to their existence. In that \nrespect, we fully support President Mahmoud Abbas in \nhis sincere endeavours to achieve the aspirations of his \npeople. He is one of the best leaders ever born in the \nland of Palestine and deserves our support in each of \nhis steps toward the attainment of the desired peace.\n\nToday, we reaffirm our support for the tireless and \nsincere efforts of United States Secretary of State John \nKerry to relaunch the peace process between Israel and \nPalestine in order to reach a permanent solution on the \nbasis of international law, the relevant United Nations \nresolutions, the two-State solution, the creation of an \nindependent Palestinian State on the basis of the 4 June \n1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, and \nany agreed swaps of territory between the two parties. \nWe look forward to seeing an end to the oppression of \nPalestinians, the lifting of the Gaza blockade and to \na halt in the building of settlements. We welcome the \ncorrect stance of the European Union whereby it refuses \nto acknowledge the legitimacy of Israeli settlements \nbuilt on Palestinian territory and suspends all financial \ndealings with such settlements.\n\nThe third pillar is the need to attain the aspirations of \nour peoples. Foremost among these are the need to raise \nliving standards, to bring about peace and stability, and \nto ensure respect for human rights through pluralism, \ndemocracy and the participation of all in a continued \ndialogue that takes into account the cultural values of a \nsociety and the levels of political, economic, social and \ncultural development of its peoples.\n\n\n\f\nThroughout the modern history and for over \ntwo centuries, the Kingdom of Bahrain has been \neager to interact with its people and to engage in a \ndialogue with them based on full transparency and \ncommitment. Ever since His Majesty King Hamad bin \nIssa Al-Khalifa assumed the leadership of the country, \nthe Kingdom has pursued a steadfast policy of laying \nthe foundations of a modern, independent, sovereign \nState based on sustainability, competitiveness, justice \nand a commitment to constitutional and legislative \nreforms. Such reforms have encompassed every aspect \nof political, economic, social and cultural life, as well \nas human rights and an enhanced role for women \nin building a society faithful to its values, culture, \naccomplishments and heritage.\n\nThe King\u2019s achievements are attributable to \ngood governance and to his support for intellectual, \npolitical and organizational efforts to create \ndemocratic institutions that give everyone a chance \nto use their talents and creativity as active citizens of \nthe contemporary world. That has made our country \nimmune to the sectarian tensions and conflicts \nwitnessed in many other countries of the region, \nnotwithstanding the acts of violence perpetrated by \nsome extremist and terrorist groups targeting security \nofficers, residents and expatriates in their quest to \nspread terror and discord and to sabotage the national \neconomy and development efforts. Such acts are being \ndealt with according to the law and justice system in a \nmanner that protects the rights of all.\n\nConvinced that Bahraini citizens have a role to play \nin building and developing their society, we seek to \ncooperate closely with national and international civil \nsociety and human rights organizations in an ongoing \ndialogue based on an exchange of experiences and \nopinions and in a spirit of cooperation, not confrontation. \nWe are all parties to the same cause in which we all \nbelieve \u2014 support and respect for and protection of \nhuman rights. In that context, the Kingdom of Bahrain \nhas achieved concrete results in the field of enhancing \nhuman rights, notably through the establishment of \na commission for prisoners and detainees, a national \nfund to compensate those affected by events, and a \ngeneral secretariat for grievances within the Ministry \nof Interior.\n\nIn that spirit, a historic initiative proposed the \ncreation of an Arab human rights court that was \nendorsed at the meeting of the League of Arab States \nheld in Qatar in March in response to the aspirations of \nthe Arab peoples. This initiative represents a qualitative \nstride for the region and conforms to the rule of law \nand similar practices in other parts of the world. For \nthe first time in modern Arab history, we will have a \ncourt to establish a solid foundation for the protection \nof human rights in the Arab world.\n\nOur national fund will compensate those affected \nby events, and the general secretariat will address \ngrievances within the Ministry of Interior operating as \nan autonomous body within the framework of national \nlaws and professional policing standards, as stipulated \nin the police code of conduct.\n\nIn response to the aspirations of the Arab peoples, \nthe GCC countries have spared no effort to achieve \npeace and security and to restore stability in some \nArab countries facing serious challenges of late. In that \nrespect, in Yemen a GCC initiative led to the national \nconsensus dialogue towards a peaceful settlement of \nthe crisis, in line with the aspirations and expectations \nof the brotherly Yemeni people to achieve security and \nstability in their land.\n\nEager to see stability restored in the Syrian Arab \nRepublic, and cognizant of the right of the Syrian \npeople to choose their own political system, we support \nthe current diplomatic steps towards destroying the \nSyrian chemical arsenal and the agreement reached \nin Geneva between the United States and the Russian \nFederation. We welcome Security Council resolution \n2118 (2013) of 27 September, which calls on all parties \nconcerned to take serious and concrete steps to address \nthe Syrian crisis and its repercussions, particularly \nparagraphs 16 and 17 related to the transitional period \nand the implementation of the Geneva communiqu\u00e9 \n(S/2012/523, annex).\n\nAll of these efforts should be complemented \nby an integrated political process so as to meet the \naspirations of the Syrian people to democracy and \npolitical pluralism. We call on the United Nations \nand the international community to shoulder their \nresponsibilities by taking the appropriate deterrent \nmeasures to halt the serious violations of human rights \nto which the Syrian people have been subject, and to put \nan end to the crimes of genocide being perpetrated with \nall kinds of lethal weapons, which have claimed more \nthan 100,000 martyrs, injured many more, and created \nmillions of refugees and internally displaced persons.\n\nI will not speak at further length, but I would like \nto assure the Assembly that the Kingdom of Bahrain, \n\n\n\f\nout of a sense of international responsibility and in \nall honesty and sincerity, wishes to play an active role \nin promoting international cooperation and strategic \npartnerships with the international community. Bahrain \nlooks forward to a better and brighter tomorrow in \nwhich individual dignity and fundamental freedoms are \na reality, and an individual\u2019s just and legitimate rights \nare protected. Bahrain rejects conflicts and wars and \nseeks to maintain friendly relations with all countries of \nthe world within the framework of respect for national \nsovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs, as \nstipulated by the principles and purposes of the Charter \nof the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "I should like \nto begin by congratulating the President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session, Ambassador \nJohn Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda. We are fully \nconvinced that he will be a manifest example of how \nsmall States can shoulder the responsibilities deriving \nfrom participating in the international community. It is \nboth an honour and a great responsibility to address the \nAssembly on behalf of the people and the Government \nof the Principality of Andorra. It is doubly an honour as \nwe are celebrating 20 years since our country became a \nMember of the United Nations.\n\nIn 1993, with the approval of the Constitution and \nour entry into the United Nations, Andorra\u2019s 700-year \nreality as a sovereign, democratic country that had no \narmy and had remained neutral \u2014 few countries can \nmake such a claim \u2014 in the heart of the Pyrenees \nwas formally recognized. The visit of the Secretary-\nGeneral to our country in April on the occasion of \nthe twentieth anniversary of our Constitution served \nto reiterate once again Andorra\u2019s commitment to the \nprinciples and values of the United Nations. Those \nprinciples and values must not remain mere high-\nsounding declarations and founding charters, but must \nbe translated into greater effectiveness in improving \npeople\u2019s lives. \n\nIt is particularly worth noting the emphasis that the \nUnited Nations has placed on development in recent \nyears. I refer to the Millennium Development Goals \nadopted in 2000, which are to be assessed definitively in \ntwo years\u2019 time. It was particularly relevant to directly \nlink the main principles of peace, democracy and the \nnegotiated resolution of conflicts and human rights \nwith more specific matters of extreme importance, \nsuch as the eradication of poverty and hunger, universal \nprimary education and the sustainability and protection \nof the environment.\n\nAt this session of the General Assembly, we have \ndiscussed and we will continue to discuss the definition \nof new goals to be introduced after 2015. However, we \nmust not forget that all reports indicate that we shall \nreach that date without having accomplished most of \nthe Goals set in 2000. Over the past 13 years we have \nadvanced very little with respect to the sustainability \nand protection of the environment. Child mortality \ncontinues to increase in the poorest regions and \ncountries. Achieving universal primary education \nby 2015 is totally unviable, and progress towards \npreventing and treating AIDS in the poorer countries \nremains inadequate. A great deal of work remains to \nbe done.\n\nIt would not, however, be fair to emphasize only \nwhat we have not done and to forget all the progress \nthat has been achieved in other areas. Since 2000, the \nproportion of people living in extreme poverty has \nbeen halved. The share of the world\u2019s population with \naccess to safe drinking water rose from 76 per cent in \n1990 to 89 per cent in 2010. Notable progress has been \nachieved in the fight against malaria and tuberculosis, \nand the goal of reducing hunger by 50 per cent in 2015 \nwould appear to be achievable, which would be a great \nsuccess. Andorra applauds the decision to conjoin the \nUnited Nations main principles with specific objectives \nto solve the great problems faced by humankind. \n\nWe must not give the impression that we are just \na group of Heads of State and Government who have \nmet in a First World city, full of fine words and good \nintentions, but completely ineffective when it comes to \nsolving the problems threatening the lives and dignity \nof millions of people all over the world. Unfortunately, \nthat is the image that we have at times projected to \nthe international community. That is why I said that \nwe applaud the fact that specific objectives have been \nset, that we evaluate progress towards meeting them \nand that we come here to explain that progress and \nshortcomings. \n\nI hope the goals of the post-2015 agenda will be \neven more ambitious and that we will be able to dedicate \neven more effort to realizing them. That is because \n\n\n\f\nthe citizens of the world need to know that those who \nproclaim the expansion of democracy and the rule of \nlaw are the same people who have striven to reduce \npoverty, hunger and child mortality and to promote \ngender equality and universal education, which are so \nimportant. Otherwise, we will run the risk of citizens \nperceiving their institutions and the United Nations as \nbeing far removed from their everyday lives and real \nproblems. Even more seriously, we would run the risk \nof words such as \u201cdemocracy\u201d, \u201chuman rights\u201d and \n\u201cinternational law\u201d becoming meaningless.\n\nA year ago, on the occasion of the sixty-seventh \nsession of the General Assembly, we condemned and \nrepudiated the Benghazi attack. Today, one year later, \nwe must all feel that we are citizens of Nairobi. We \nmust stand with those who condemn terrorism and \ndefend the principles of the United Nations. A year \nago we used this platform to express our deep concern \nabout the civil war in Syria, in particular the conflict\u2019s \ndevastating effects on the Syrian population. We said \nthen that the conflict was creating a terrible dilemma \nfor the international community \u2014 that of finding \nthe right balance between a diplomatic resolution and \nrespect for the rule of law. \n\nThe use of chemical weapons against civilians, \nwhich we condemn and which is contrary to all the \nvalues that the General Assembly upholds, places the \ninternational community in a scenario that requires \nfirm and strong answers. The strong reaction to the \nsituation led by the United States and France, along \nwith the pragmatic attitude of Russia, has generated \nthe momentum to advance in the search for that fair \nbalance. \n\nFirst is the issue of reaching agreement on the \nevidence and destruction of such chemical weapons; \nsecond is the issue of taking advantage of this dynamic \nin order to make greater diplomatic efforts to achieve a \npeaceful solution to the conflict. That will require new \nsteps towards furthering the Geneva process. Nor must \nwe forget the humanitarian dimension of the Syrian \nconflict, which is not only a priority but a terrible loss \nand a cruel emergency. \n\nThe resumption of negotiations between Palestinians \nand Israelis can also be included in the dynamic \nof our quest for the right balance, based on a two-\nState-solution, between the legitimate demand of the \nPalestinian people for a peaceful and democratic State \nand the desire of Israelis to obtain assurances for their \nexistence, safety and security.\n\nEach and every time we are unable to resolve a \nconflict, we are jeopardizing the principles and values \nthat are most valued by the international community: \npeace, security, dialogue, human rights and democracy. \nIt is not always easy for the international community \nto find a fair and effective way of responding, perhaps \nbecause we are responding to the problems rather than \npreventing them. Therefore, I would like to return to \nwhat I said at the beginning of my speech. We cannot \nallow the principles and values of the United Nations \nto be relegated to high-flown declarations that have \nno positive impact on people\u2019s lives. Peace, the rule of \nlaw and democracy must be accompanied by effective \nrespect for human rights and a substantial improvement \nin the living conditions of people, which means less \npoverty, less hunger, more education and more gender \nequality. An ambitious development agenda that is \nimplemented effectively is the best way of preventing \nconflicts and ensuring peace and security.\n\nEarly in my statement, in recalling Andorra\u2019s \nadmission into the United Nations 20 years ago, I \nreferred to the more than seven centuries of peace \nin our country, which is a relevant point to make at \nan event such as this. I am sure that other Andorran \nrepresentatives have raised this point. We are proud of \nour country\u2019s peaceful history, but we are also keenly \naware that Andorra, a small State, would probably not \nhave enjoyed more than 700 years of peace had there \nbeen any great inequalities among its inhabitants, had \nthe laws not been fair or had tyranny reigned instead \nof a parliamentary regime, since there cannot be peace \nwithout justice in Andorra or anywhere else. \n\nAll of us who are here today, all of us who have \nspoken from this rostrum this week, are obligated to \nensure peace and justice, democracy and development, \nhuman rights and the peaceful resolution of conflicts. \nAll the principles and values to which we are firmly \ncommitted must always go hand in hand. It is a long and \ndifficult path, but it is the only way in which a better \nworld can possibly come about. \n\nReferring to what President Obama said a few \ndays ago (see A/68/PV.5), it is obvious that we live in \na world of imperfect choices. This difficulty must not \nbe used as an excuse for our failure to act. As President \nHollande stated from this very rostrum (see A/68/PV.5), \n\n\nthe United Nations has a responsibility to act, and the \nworst decision is to take no action at all. \n"

        "file_text": "Twenty years ago \nI took the floor for the first time before the General \nAssembly. A few months before that, on 28 May 1993, \nMonaco had become the one hundred and eighty-third \nState Member of the United Nations, the smallest \nMember State of the only universal Organization. The \ndecision of Prince Rainier III, my father, reflected \nthe will to fully assume our role as a responsible and \ncommitted State within a changing world, where new \nopportunities and new challenges were becoming \ninterdependent and transcending borders. \n\nThat vision remains unchanged over the passage \nof time. My country continues to shoulder all its \nresponsibilities on the major issues that bring us \ntogether here today. Faithful to its principles and to \nits past, the Principality of Monaco wishes to make \nits contribution in the most effective way possible to \nthe task of building peace, to which we have been so \nattached over the centuries. \n\nTherefore, inspired by a conviction that our shared \nhumanity requires that each of us treat our fellow \nhuman beings with respect and dignity, tolerance \nand comprehension, we have endorsed the values and \nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, which \nwe aspire together to defend and to promote. That \nimportant decision to fulfil the responsibility that each \nMember State has is strengthened by the conviction, \noriginating from the holding of the first Earth Summit, \nin 1992, that sustainable development, without which \nwe cannot aspire to our ideal of peace, must be planned \nwith respect for the environment of our planet. \n\nIt is in a sombre international context that we are \ngoing to define the post-2015 development agenda, \nan agenda that will be the cornerstone of the work of \nthe Organization and will be crucial to establishing \nits political legitimacy for decades to come. The \ngrowing insecurity in the world, characterized by the \nfragmentation of societies, threatens the progress made \nin many fields and causes multidimensional regional \ninstability that is likely to further deepen existing \ndifferences. \n\nThe recent attacks perpetrated in Kenya, Pakistan \nand Iraq are another shocking illustration of that \nproblem. They remind us that many parts of the world \nare still subject to deadly terrorist attacks. Allow me \nto extend to the families of the victims and to their \nGovernment my deepest condolences. \n\nI must also speak out against persisting conflicts, \nwhich hamper development and cause an unacceptable \nhumanitarian situation. With regard to Syria in \nparticular, the number of displaced civilians and \nrefugees in bordering countries is of great concern. A \nnew threshold was crossed with the use of chemical \nweapons, an extremely serious violation of international \nlaw that cannot be tolerated. Monaco associates itself \nwith those who continue to advocate for a political \nsettlement of the conflict, especially in the light of \nthe recent agreement on the control and destruction \nof chemical weapons stockpiles in Syria. Those \nresponsible for the use of chemical weapons cannot go \nunpunished. \n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross, \nwhich I wish to pay tribute to for its determination to \nfulfil its mandate in spite of difficult circumstances, \nmust be given access to populations in need and must \nbe assured that it is able to conduct its activities in full \nsecurity.\n\nThe tenth anniversary of the attack on United \nNations staff in Baghdad is a sad reminder that we \nneed to relentlessly continue with our efforts on \nbehalf of United Nations staff, who too often have \nbecome deliberate targets. That deplorable situation \nwill be given attention in the coming world summit \non humanitarian aid to be held on the initiative of the \nSecretary-General, which we fully support.\n\nThe evolution of factors that lead to humanitarian \nemergencies forces us to examine the ways in which \nthe Organization can act in such circumstances, which \ninclude conflicts, natural disasters, climate change and \n\n\n\f\nenvironmental degradation. We must recognize that the \nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, to \nwhich I express my deepest gratitude, needs to be given \nthe means and the resources required for it to carry out \nthe mandate we have given it.\n\nTo those who criticize or threaten the progress of \nthe United Nations, the results accomplished show that \nour courageous political decisions, in the fields of both \nsecurity and development, are timely and positive. \n\nTogether, in the year 2000, we defined the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), which today \nhave made it possible for billions of people to live \nbetter. Those successes are all the more remarkable \ngiven that progress has been achieved in spite of the \neffects of many crises of a financial, economic, food \nand energy nature, some of whose consequences linger \nand are even worsening. \n\nTomorrow, the special event devoted to the \nMDGs will be an opportunity to reiterate our priority \ncommitment to eliminating poverty and an opportunity \nfor us to redouble efforts to hasten the achievement of \nthe Goals. \n\nThe Millennium Development Goals Report 2013 \nindicates the areas that require urgent action and the \nsignificant gaps that exist, not only among countries \nbut within their borders. We cannot tolerate the fact that \nthere are still people who have been rejected by society, \npeople for whom the hope born of a new millennium \nremains a broken promise. It is not acceptable that in \ntoday\u2019s world human beings still live close to complete \ndestitution, where even their basic needs go unmet. \nThat is why we applaud the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts \non behalf of his mobilization campaigns \u2014 Education \nFirst, \u201cEvery woman, every child\u201d and Scaling \nUp Nutrition \u2014 which push us to shoulder our \nresponsibilities towards the world\u2019s most vulnerable.\n\nEducation, the promotion of women, the protection \nof children, public health and the conservation \nof natural resources are priority elements in the \ninternational cooperation policies that I have outlined. \nThey are structured around the eight MDGs, especially \nmaternal and child health, the fight against pandemics \nand neglected diseases and the promotion of food \nsecurity, and in particular they are geared towards the \nleast developed countries. It seems to me that a policy \nof international cooperation should respond as much \nas possible to their interests, so that a virtuous circle \nof development can be launched and help build a more \njust, stable and less unequal world.\n\nImportant advances have often been accompanied \nor completed by the adoption of measures emerging \nfrom the Organization\u2019s major conferences and \nsummits. By strengthening the treaty regime on human \nrights, disarmament and the fight against terrorism, and \nthrough the regimes established by the Security Council, \nMember States have endowed themselves with the \nmeans to reaffirm their faith in multilateralism, which \nis the reason for the Organization\u2019s existence, and in \nthe rule of law, which is the foundation of our collective \naction. It is vital that we speed up the implementation \nof the Programme of Action adopted in Istanbul in 2011 \nat the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least \nDeveloped Countries.\n\nThe work that lies ahead for the President of the \nGeneral Assembly comes at a turning point in our \nhistory. Under his leadership, the General Assembly \nmust not only speed up the implementation of the MDGs \nbut also prepare the post-2015 development agenda and \ndefine the sustainable development goals in accordance \nwith this session\u2019s theme \u201cThe post-2015 development \nagenda: setting the stage\u201d.\n\nHis valuable experience and unreserved dedication \nto the Organization, and to sustainable development in \nparticular, will guide our deliberations. We are grateful \nto have him, a son of Antigua and Barbuda, a small \nisland developing State, presiding over the upcoming \ndiscussions, since we are confident that he is all too \nfamiliar with the issues at stake.\n\nHe should also rest assured that Monaco\u2019s \nrepresentative, in its capacity as Vice-President, is \nready to support him in his noble task.\n\nBased on lessons learned from the MDGs, together \nwe will build an ambitious new development programme \ncapable of responding effectively to the demands of our \nnew reality. I have climate change in mind in particular. \nGreenhouse-gas emissions continue to increase at the \nglobal level, despite the fact that we have identified \nclimate change as one of the greatest dangers of our \nera. The Secretary-General can count on my country\u2019s \ncontribution to the upcoming summit on climate \nchange, which he intends to hold next September. His \nwillingness to bring together leaders from every sector \n\n\n\f\nof society \u2014 civil society, the private sector, the world \nof business and finance and, above all, young people, \nall of them agents of change \u2014 is the only path of hope \nfor the radical transformation that is needed. There is \nno alternative to defining a new programme and a new \nparadigm.\n\nAt the current rate, if we do not change our \nbehaviour, we will need the equivalent of two planet \nEarths to meet the needs of the world\u2019s population, \nwhich, as we know, will reach 9 billion in 2050 and \nhas always been concentrated in urban and coastal \nzones, whose natural resources are particularly \nvulnerable. That simple fact should prompt us to adopt \nsustainable modes of production and consumption, \nin accordance with the decisions taken at the United \nNations Conference on Sustainable Development. That \nessential change of mindset presupposes that we place \nhuman beings at the heart of the development issue. It is \nno longer a question of agreeing on development plans \nfor agricultural, artisanal and industrial capacities. We \nmust consider that it is human societies and individuals \nwho deserve all of our attention. We must study \neconomic and environmental issues in the light of their \nimpact on the lives of people and communities. Taking \nthose needs into account means that we must reflect \nfurther on how to ensure responsible development that \nrespects the environment and is truly sustainable.\n\nThe Assembly is aware of my personal commitment \nto issues involving the oceans and seas. In accordance \nwith the Monaco Message on the acknowledged \nimportance of the oceans in \u201cThe future we want\u201d \n(resolution 66/288, annex), which was adopted in \nNovember 2011, I am once again committing to \npromoting the role of the oceans in the definition of \nthe post-2015 agenda and to reiterating my support for \na sustainable development goal focusing on the oceans. \nClimate regulation, food and nutrition security, energy, \ntourism, transport and international trade \u2014 all areas \ndirectly or indirectly affected by the oceans \u2014 are \nlinked to the three pillars of sustainable development. \nI think it is also essential to reaffirm how fundamental \nthe oceans are to the world and how serious are the \nrisks presented to them through the excessive human \nactivity that contributes to their acidification and the \nacceleration of the drop in the resources they contain.\n\nIn that context, I would like to say how crucial I \nbelieve it is that the international community address the \nstatus of the high seas without delay, and how urgent it \nis that protected marine areas be established, especially \nin the polar regions. If the viability and sustainable \nmanagement of the oceans are to be achieved, only \nan unswerving political willingness to form strong \npartnerships that unite all the parties concerned will be \nable to combat the effects of the overfishing, pollution \nand acidification of the oceans and restore them to \nhealth and productivity.\n\nStrengthening cooperation and partnerships, as well \nas deciding on concrete action, are also at the heart of \nthe preparations for the third International Conference \non Small Island Developing States, to which I want to \ngive my full support, along with a needed boost in the \nsolidarity that is essential to promoting sustainable \ndevelopment.\n\nThe stakes are clear. Let us, who wish to reaffirm \nthe central place that the Organization occupies in \ninternational governance, give it the means to assure \nthat leadership role by being ambitious and resolute \nin our task. Let us remember the words of the novelist \nAntoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry: \u201cBeing a human being \nmeans being responsible\u201d.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to begin \nby congratulating you, President Ashe, from our sister \nisland of Antigua and Barbuda, which is also a member \nof the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States and \nthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM), on your well-\ndeserved election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. The Government \nand the people of the Commonwealth of Dominica are \nproud of your appointment and wish you success in \npresiding over the General Assembly. We also express \nour appreciation and gratitude to your predecessor, His \nExcellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi., for his guidance during \nthe sixty-seventh session.\n\nThirteen years after collectively committing to \nmeeting the needs of the poorest among us by attaining \nour noble Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \nwe have made some progress globally, but we are \nstill far from fully reaching our targets. Despite the \nchallenges brought about by an increasingly hostile \nglobal environment, Dominica has made meaningful \nprogress towards the achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. The Government of Dominica \nhas accepted that it is through the development of our \nhuman resources that we will be able to truly attain \ndevelopment that is inclusive and sustainable. As a \nresult, our Government has kept our people at the centre \nof development.\n\nWe have been able to bring significant \nimprovements in the lives of our people and to attain \nall the Millennium Development Goals, despite our \nlimitations. We have reduced poverty and hunger \nby more than half. Our children, boys and girls, now \nhave universal access to both primary and secondary \neducation, as well as expanded access to post-secondary \neducation and training. Our girls and women are not \nonly being treated as equals with boys and men but have \nreceived tremendous support in improving their living \nconditions. Our elderly people and children enjoy free \naccess to public health care.\n\nDominica has continued to maintain its coveted \ntitle of \u201cnature island of the Caribbean\u201d by adhering to \nself-imposed sustainable environmental practices over \nthe past several decades, a model that we hope more \nStates around the world can emulate.\n\nAs we approach 2015, we must resolve to take \nstock. We must be forever mindful that those who are \ncondemned to poverty still await our intervention. \nThe more than 1 billion people who have known only \ndarkness at the end of each day long for at least one \nlight bulb in a rural home so that their children can have \nopportunities for a brighter tomorrow. We have run out \nof excuses for why we are still waiting to act or cannot \nact. Rest assured that our people will judge us harshly \nfor failing to make a difference in their lives.\n\nDespite the current global challenges, South-South \ncooperation continues to play a significant role in \nhelping small countries like Dominica to achieve their \nMillennium Development Goals. The Government and \npeople of Dominica express their sincere gratitude to \nthe Governments of the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nVenezuela, Cuba, Morocco, the European Union, the \nBolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America \nand other bilateral and multilateral partners for the \ntremendous contributions they have made, and continue \nto make, in the development of our human-resource \ncapacity and infrastructure and in the implementation \nof our public-sector investment programme.\n\nOur commitment to the MDGs should consist of \na redoubling of efforts towards a post-2015 agenda \nthat will bring about development that is inclusive and \nsustainable. The outcome of the 2012 United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development (resolution \n\n\n\f\n66/288, annex) initiated an inclusive intergovernmental \nprocess for preparing a set of sustainable development \ngoals (SDGs). My delegation believes that in order to \narrive at a global development agenda for the post-\n2015 period, there must be close linkages between \nthe processes of the MDGs and the SDGs. The \nCommonwealth of Dominica therefore aligns itself \nwith the theme set by you, Mr. President, \u201cThe post-\n2015 development agenda: setting the stage\u201d.\n\nIt is imperative that the development agenda \nbeyond 2015 remain the focus of the United Nations, \nparticularly in terms of relieving poverty and protecting \nour planet. A meaningful agenda must take into account \nthe significance of the need for an international legally \nbinding commitment to combating climate change, the \ndevelopment and deployment of sustainable energy, the \nsustainable use of the oceans and marine resources, \nsustainable industrial development, and international \npeace and security.\n\nMy delegation applauds the leadership and vision \nshown by the Secretary-General in declaring sustainable \nenergy to be one of the priorities of his second term. \nWe also congratulate the Secretary-General\u2019s Advisory \nGroup on Energy and Climate Change, as well as \ncolleagues within and outside the United Nations \nsystem, for their timely recommendations and for \nbringing needed visibility to the subject of sustainable \nenergy. Their recommendations form the basis for one \nof the most important initiatives ever launched by a \nSecretary-General, namely, the Sustainable Energy for \nAll initiative, launched in 2011. Through that visionary \nstep, the Secretary-General has closed the gaping \nenergy-poverty gap in the MDGs.\n\nActions that will benefit our peoples should be \nat the heart of the functions of the Assembly. The \nCommonwealth of Dominica and other small and low-\nlying developing States that are members of the Small \nIsland Developing States Sustainable Energy Initiative \nare grateful to the Secretary-General for his dedication, \npersonal commitment and actions in helping to make \nthe Sustainable Energy for All initiative a reality. \nThat initiative stands to benefit our people across the \ndeveloping world and to contribute to more efficient \nenergy systems in developed countries.\n\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica maintains that \nsustainable energy is the foundation for long-term \nsocioeconomic development. For that reason, Dominica \nis pleased to have joined the Sustainable Energy for All \npartnership. My Government, with assistance from \nits development partners, is committed to increasing \nrenewable energy generation from the current 30 per \ncent from hydro to 100 per cent by adding geothermal \nenergy to the mix. Our goal is to become not only \ncarbon-neutral but carbon-negative by 2020. That \nambition will be achieved by exporting renewable \nenergy to our neighbours, Guadeloupe and Martinique, \nvia submarine cables. We thank our partners, and \nespecially the Clinton Climate Initiative, part of the \nClinton Foundation, for their support in this endeavour.\n\nThat transformation to a sustainable energy \nsector will deliver multiple significant benefits for \nDominica, including increasing employment from \nnew energy-service companies, minimizing foreign \n-exchange transfers for petroleum imports, reducing \nthe cost of energy and minimizing the volatility and \nunpredictability of energy prices. Recognizing the \ninextricable link between energy and development, we \nexpect that sustainable energy will find its rightful place \non the agenda of the third International Conference on \nSmall Island Developing States, to be held in Apia, \nSamoa, in 2014.\n\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica is privileged to \nbe the chair of the 31-member Steering Committee \nof the Small Island Developing States Sustainable \nEnergy Initiative, which is charged with guiding the \ndevelopment of the Initiative. I would therefore, on \nbehalf of our members, like to express our sincere \nappreciation to the Governments of Denmark and Japan \nfor their recognition and their financial support to the \nInitiative. The Initiative is well positioned to help tackle \nthe effects of climate change while at the same time \ntransforming energy sectors in small island developing \nStates such as Dominica.\n\nOur Danish partners took the first bold move to \nsupport the Initiative, which was the catalyst for support \nfrom the Government of Japan. Assistance from Japan \nwill be invested in the first-ever ocean thermal energy \nfeasibility study in the Republic of the Marshall Islands. \nOcean thermal energy is a resource common to all \nSIDS and represents a vast sustainable energy resource \nthat, once developed, could also address a number of \nkey climate-change adaptation challenges for islands, \nspecifically in the area of fresh water and improved \nfood security.\n\nAbout two thirds of the world\u2019s surface is covered \nby oceans and seas connecting almost 90 per cent of the \nworld\u2019s population. Oceans and seas remain the source \nof food and livelihood for nearly 1 billion people. A post-\n\n\n\f\n2015 agenda must address the important role of seas and \noceans to the survival of peoples throughout the world, \nespecially those who live on islands. A sustainable \ndevelopment goal on oceans should therefore ensure that \nall fish stocks are harvested sustainably and preserve \nthe health of the marine environment. That will require \nthe protection of marine areas, the reduction of ocean \nacidification, the elimination of marine pollution and \nthe cessation of disruptive fishing practices.\n\nThere is general consensus that sustainable \ndevelopment and poverty eradication should form \nthe core of the SDGs and the post-2015 development \nagenda. We cannot address the issue of poverty \neradication without addressing the issues of wealth \ncreation and economic growth. Developing countries, \nSIDS in particular, will be able to secure inclusive \nand sustained economic growth only through the \ndevelopment of the energy, agriculture and tourism \nsectors and associated industries. Broad-based job \ncreation and the achievement of social goals, such as \neducation, women\u2019s empowerment and health care, \nrequire sustainable industrial development.\n\nIt must be underscored that, in the twenty-first \ncentury, industrialization must be inclusive and \nsustainable if all our present and future generations \nare to benefit. It must incorporate all citizens and be \nstrategically tailored to preserve livelihoods for future \ngenerations.\n\nSustainable development goals, however, cannot \nbe achieved in the midst of wars between or within \nnations. The Commonwealth of Dominica condemns \nthe act of terrorism at the Westgate Shopping Mall in \nNairobi. We extend our condolences to the Government \nand the people of Kenya and to the families of the \nKenyans and the foreign nationals who met their deaths \nat the hands of those who have no respect for human \nlife. We must continue to fight terrorism in all its forms \nand manifestations.\n\nThe economic embargo against our brothers and \nsisters in Cuba continues to be a concern for us in the \nCaribbean. Unilateral actions by the United States of \nAmerica continue to be the root cause of the suffering \nof our brothers and sisters in the Republic of Cuba. \nOur region of the Caribbean continues to witness the \nunheeded call for the lifting of a half-century economic \nembargo on our brothers and sisters. We call on the \nGovernment of the United States to support the full \nintegration of the Cuban people into the global trading \nsystem. That will help to improve their lives and allow \nthe world to benefit from the tremendous contributions \nthey are capable of making, especially in the areas of \nscience and technology.\n\nThe ongoing civil war in Syria continues to present \na major challenge to the international community. \nThe Commonwealth of Dominica joins CARICOM in \nunreservedly condemning the use of chemical weapons, \nwhich is a gross violation of international law. We call \non all parties involved in the conflict to bring an end \nto the hostilities, which have claimed the lives of far \ntoo many innocent civilians, especially children. The \nworld is watching. The role of the United Nations is \ncentral to resolving the Syrian conflict. My delegation \nsupports the call of the Secretary-General for resolution \nthrough dialogue and not through the use of military \nforce or any other such action. Lasting peace can be \nachieved in Syria only through a negotiated political \nsettlement that will facilitate reconciliation. What is \nrequired is the will of the international community to \nfurther that process. We commend the efforts of the \nUnited States of America and Russia in attempting to \neliminate chemical weapons in Syria and move towards \na peaceful resolution of the conflict.\n\nAs we prepare for Samoa 2014, the Commonwealth \nof Dominica is keen to make concrete progress for \nSIDS aimed at creating a future of prosperity and \nopportunity for all of our peoples. In that regard, my \nGovernment calls for a renewed political commitment \nby all countries to effectively address the special needs \nand vulnerabilities of SIDS. We believe that this will \nrequire consolidated effort focused on pragmatic actions \nfor the further implementation of the Barbados Plan of \nAction and the Mauritius Strategy. Dominica laments \nthe fact that international financial mechanisms have \nfailed to fully recognize and support the vulnerabilities \nof SIDS, which must be allowed access to financing \nfor development. The United Nations system needs to \nbe strengthened to implement the Barbados Plan and \nMauritius Strategy.\n\nOn 2 April, the Commonwealth of Dominica was \none of an overwhelming majority of Member States \nthat voted in favour of the first international treaty to \nregulate the trade of conventional weapons \u2014 the Arms \nTrade Treaty (ATT). Today, we are pleased that the ATT \nis now a reality. That is a significant milestone, as such \nregulations will serve to curb the illicit international \nsale of conventional weapons to unscrupulous parties. \nMoreover, the Commonwealth of Dominica is satisfied \nthat the ATT will close loopholes that allow terrorists \n\n\n\f\nand other criminals to arm themselves and endanger \ninnocent lives. To that end, my delegation is pleased to \nannounce that Dominica has added its name to the list \nof signatories to that Treaty.\n\nDominica, the nature island of the Caribbean, \ncontinues to navigate through waters made turbulent \nby a hostile international financial and trading system, \nthe continued impact of climate change, the movement \nof small arms and light weapons from North to South, \nand the international trade in illegal drugs and the \nviolence that they visit upon us. For those reasons, we \nagain reiterate the importance of international support \nfor SIDS. A post-2015 global development agenda \nmust continue to build on the gains achieved under the \nMillennium Development Goals. It must focus on the \nsustainable use of resources to reduce the impact of \nclimate change, to protect our seas and oceans and to \npromote the transition from fossil fuels to renewable \nsources in the generation of energy able to power \nsustainable industrial development.\n\nThe International Conference on Small Island \nDeveloping States, to be held in Samoa in 2014, presents \nan ideal opportunity for the international community \nto collectively chart a path towards the sustainable \ndevelopment of SIDS and to set the stage for the post-\n2015 development agenda. The Commonwealth of \nDominica remains committed to the progress made \nthus far, and it looks forward with eager anticipation \nto the forging of durable and sustainable partnerships.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the Government \nand people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, I salute \nthe President as he presides over the General Assembly \nat its sixty-eighth session. I assure him of the full \nsupport and cooperation of the Nigerian delegation. I \nalso wish to extend our commendation to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon and to place on record Nigeria\u2019s \nappreciation of his focused and committed leadership \nof the United Nations system.\n\nThis session comes at a particularly trying period \nwhen our world faces a number of critical challenges, \nwhich make it imperative for us to work within \nthe Charter of the United Nations to address them \nmeaningfully. It is therefore apt that the theme for this \nsession, \u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: setting \nthe stage\u201d, signposts our desire and determination to \nactively cooperate for the improvement of the overall \nwelfare and well-being of the most vulnerable citizens \nof the States Members of the Organization.\n\nNigeria appreciates the consultative nature of \ndesigning the post-2015 development agenda. Earlier \nin the year, we supported this global outreach through \ninclusive consultations and surveys of a number of \nNigerians, who expressed their aspirations with respect \nto the world they expect beyond 2015. A major highlight \nof that process, which has increased national ownership \nof the agenda, is the emphasis on the eradication of \n\n\n\f\npoverty as the overarching principle in the formulation \nof the successor framework. Tomorrow, Nigeria will host \na side event on the implementation of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), in collaboration with the \nUnited Nations, a number of African countries and our \ndevelopment partners.\n\nAs I had cause to say before the Assembly at its \nprevious session (see A/67/PV.8), the year 2015 is not \na destination but only a milestone to a better, safer, \nhealthier and more compassionate world. Let us \ntherefore renew our commitment to the processes that \nwill develop the post-MDG framework.\n\nThat objective is of particular resonance to us in \nAfrica, where the challenges of poverty, illiteracy, \nfood insecurity and climate change continue to engage \nthe attention of the political leadership. The good \nnews, however, is that in the past decade, a sustained \ndemocratization process across the continent has \nmade significant difference in governance processes, \ninstitutions and structures. Today, we have a renascent \nAfrica, which has moved away from the era of \ndictatorship to a new dawn, where the ideals of good \ngovernance and an emphasis on human rights and \njustice are beginning to drive State-society relations. \nThis is the present reality of Africa that must replace \nthe old prejudices and assumptions about the continent.\n\nWe are firm in our conviction that democracy is \nfundamental to achieving the requisite stability that \nwill enable the realization of a sustainable post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda in Africa. This emergent Africa \nwill require the continued support and partnership of the \ninternational community \u2014 an Africa that is no longer \nmerely a destination for aid but one that is involved in \nconstructive, multi-sectoral exchanges on the global \nstage. Our continent stands ready to continue to engage \nthe rest of the world as a partner in formulating a global \ndevelopment agenda that will guarantee peace, security \nand stability.\n\nI wish to express my appreciation at Nigeria\u2019s \nselection as co-Chair of the Intergovernmental \nCommittee of Experts on Sustainable Development \nFinancing. The importance of the Committee\u2019s \nassignment cannot be overstated. For the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda to be realistic, it must be backed \nby a robust financing framework, which I hope will \nreceive the strong backing of the Organization\u2019s better-\nendowed Members.\n\nNigeria\u2019s commitment to sustainable peace and \nsecurity propels the country to action along with \nmember States of our subregional and continental \norganizations whenever stability is threatened in \nour continent. In recent years, Africa has had its \nshare of conflicts, notably in Mali, Guinea-Bissau, \nthe Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central \nAfrican Republic and Somalia. It is noteworthy that \nAfrican leaders, with the support of the international \ncommunity, have demonstrated the capacity to work in \nconcert and decisively in pursuit of long-term solutions \nin the affected States. While a lot more still needs to \nbe done, we are convinced that progress is being made.\n\nThe recent presidential elections in Mali herald \na new beginning that should translate into peace and \nprosperity for its people and provide a stronger basis \nfor stability within the subregion. I congratulate \nPresident Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, who is here with \nus today. Similarly, the political transition process in \nGuinea-Bissau holds much promise. Among African \nleaders, there is a greater determination and focus on \nthe transformation of the continent. That is the required \nimpetus for the achievement of development objectives \nthat will benefit the people, and rebrand the continent \neven more positively.\n\nAlthough our world has not witnessed a global \nwar since the establishment of the United Nations, \nthere have been several conflicts with devastating \nconsequences and impact in virtually all regions of \nthe world. As global citizens, we have a sacred duty to \nfree our world of wars, rivalries, ethnic conflicts and \nreligious divisions. Our collective effort in our drive for \na better world will continue to bind us together.\n\nNigeria continues to support the efforts of the \nUnited Nations in addressing the global initiative to \ncombat the menace of the illicit trade in small arms and \nlight weapons. We have redoubled efforts to address \nthis onerous challenge within our borders and across the \nWest African subregion. In doing so, we also recognize \nthe need for a broad-based global partnership in the \nongoing battle against transborder crimes, including \nterrorism and acts of piracy. It is regrettable that \nthese scourges are sustained by unfettered access by \nnon-State actors to illicit small arms and light weapons, \nwith which they foster insecurity and instability across \nour continent. For us in Africa, these are the weapons \nof mass destruction.\n\nIt is therefore in the light of our collective \nobligation and unceasing struggle to end this nightmare \n\n\n\f\nthat I congratulate Member States on the adoption of \nthe Arms Trade Treaty in April. Our hope is that, upon \nits entry into force, the Treaty will herald an era of \naccountable trade in conventional arms, which is critical \nto the security of nations. In line with our continued \ncommitment to that project, Nigeria has signed and \nratified the Treaty. We will continue to engage other \nMember States for its successful implementation.\n\nTerrorism constitutes a major threat to global peace \nand security and undermines the capacity for sustained \ndevelopment. In Nigeria, the threat of terrorism in \na few states in the north-eastern part of our country \nhas proven to be a challenge to national stability. We \nwill spare no effort in addressing this menace. We \nare therefore confronting it with every resource at our \ndisposal, with due regard for fundamental human rights \nand the rule of law. Nigeria would like to place on record \nits appreciation to the international community for its \nsupport in that regard. The reign of terror anywhere \nin the world is an assault on our collective humanity. \nThree days ago, the stark reality of that menace was \nagain brought to the fore by the dastardly terrorist \nattack in Nairobi. We must stand together to win this \nwar together.\n\nPiracy, like terrorism, is another menace that has \nattained worrying proportions, especially in Africa\u2019s \ncoastal waters. At the bilateral and multilateral \nlevels, Nigeria has promoted cooperation to mitigate \npiracy\u2019s impact on and consequences for the security \nand economies of affected coastal States. Indeed, in \nJune, the leaders of the Economic Community of West \nAfrican States, the Economic Community of Central \nAfrican States and the Gulf of Guinea Commission \nmet in Yaound\u00e9 and came up with practical steps to \ncollectively confront the menace of piracy in the Gulf of \nGuinea. That effort will no doubt require reinforcement \nand wider support and collaborative action on the part \nof our international partners.\n\nThe situation in the Middle East remains volatile. \nThe reported use of chemical weapons in the Syrian \ncrisis is unacceptable. Nigeria condemns, in the \nstrongest possible terms, the use of chemical weapons \nprohibited by international conventions. We applaud the \ncurrent diplomatic efforts to avert a further escalation \nof the crisis. We urge all parties involved to end the \nviolence and seek a negotiated solution, including \nthrough the instruments of the United Nations.\n\nThe threat that nuclear weapons pose to the \nsurvival of the human race is to be understood not just \nin the context of States that aspire to such weapons but \nalso of the nations already in possession of them. It is \nour collective responsibility to urge the international \ncommunity to respond to the clarion call for a peaceful \nuniverse in an age of uncertainty. We can attain that \nobjective if we adopt measures and policies that \npromote nuclear disarmament, protect and renew our \nenvironment and push towards an international system \nthat is based on trust, mutual respect and shared goals.\n\n\nI believe that I express the concern of many when \nI bring up the slow pace of effort and apparent lack of \nprogress in the reform of the United Nations, especially \nthe Security Council. We believe strongly that the call \nfor democratization worldwide should apply not only \nto States but also to international organizations such \nas the United Nations. That is why we call for the \nCouncil\u2019s democratization. It is desirable in order to \nenshrine justice, equity and fairness and to promote a \nsense of inclusiveness and balance in our world.\n\nOur support for the Security Council in its primary \nresponsibility \u2014 the maintenance of international peace \nand security \u2014 has been total and unwavering. In our \nprevious membership of the Council we demonstrated \nboth the political will and the capacity to engage in key \nCouncil responsibilities. Nigeria has therefore decided \nto seek election to a non-permanent seat on the Security \nCouncil for the period 2014 to 2015, for which I am \npleased to be able to say we have been endorsed by the \nEconomic Community of West African States and the \nAfrican Union. We urge the Assembly to endorse our \ncandidature.\n\nOur world continues to be confronted by pressing \nproblems and threats. No statement made during this \nsession can encompass the extent of those problems. \nThe world looks to us, as leaders, to provide hope in \nthe midst of crisis, to offer guidance through difficult \nsociopolitical divisions and to ensure that we live in \na better world. We have obligations to the current \ngeneration, but we have a greater obligation to those \nyet unborn, who should one day be able to inherit a \nworld of sufficiency, irrespective of the circumstances \nof their birth or where they stand on the globe. We must \nwork to make that world a reality in recognition of our \ncommon heritage. We must strive to eradicate poverty, \nhunger, disease and human misery; we must eliminate \nthe scourge of nuclear, chemical and biological warfare, \nas well as that of small arms and light weapons. We \nmust dedicate ourselves to working together to address \n\n\n\f\nglobal, regional and national challenges and to deliver a \nmore peaceful, equitable and prosperous world for all. \nIt is our duty. We must not fail.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the \nSenegalese delegation, I would like to wish you, Sir, all \nthe best as President at the sixty-eighth session of the \nGeneral Assembly. \n\nBy focusing its debate on the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda, the General Assembly reminds us \nthat there is not much time left before attainment of \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is finally \nevaluated. Despite progress after more than a decade \nof implementing the MDGs, the magnitude of the \nchallenges is still overwhelming. In terms of access to \nfood, housing, education and healthcare, the daily lives of \nnearly one billion people have barely improved. Women \ncontinue to die in childbirth. Inequalities persist within \nand between countries. The economic crisis continues \nand environmental degradation is worsening. We need \nto take concrete and resolute actions to transform our \ncollective ambitions into reality. \n\nIn the quest for sustainable development, a \nconference on climate change in 2015 in Paris will \nprovides us with another opportunity to pull ourselves \ntogether, by reversing the negative effects of climate \nchange on Earth, our common habitat.\n\nAddressing the challenges of sustainable \ndevelopment and building the future we want, in \nthe spirit of the Rio+20 Conference, require a more \nsustained effort than the fight against poverty. \nWe should invest more in education, as the Global \nPartnership for Education expects of us. We need to \nmodernize agriculture, make electricity accessible to \neverybody and develop infrastructure to foster trade and \ninvestment. These are the pillars that underpin growth \nand prosperity. It is precisely this vision that the New \nPartnership for Africa\u2019s Development (NEPAD) seeks \nto promote through its Programme for Infrastructure \nDevelopment in Africa (PIDA).\n\nAs part of that programme, 51 priority projects \nhave been identified and established throughout the \ncontinent. Overall, they will cost $68 billion between \n2012 and 2020. As Chairperson of NEPAD\u2019s Orientation \nCommittee, I am pleased with the consensus that our \npartners have built around PIDA, namely, the Group of \nTwenty and the Group of Eight (G-8) and with Brazil, \nRussia, India and China.\n\nI also welcome the very strong signal which the \nG-8, meeting in June in Lough Erne, sent concerning \nthe need for a concerted campaign against tax evasion \nand other fraudulent practices affecting our economies. \nWe must now push ahead and launch the mechanisms \nwe have agreed on for improving transparency in \ninternational transactions, including the mining \nindustry. This is the best way to support Africa\u2019s efforts \nto mobilize domestic resources in order to finance its \ndevelopment.\n\nSimilarly, Senegal calls for the reform of \ninternational economic and financial governance, \nnotably the terms for accessing credit and obtaining \nfinancing for economic and social development \nprojects. Let us not pave the road to the future with \nthe instruments of the past. While plummeting official \ndevelopment assistance no longer meets Africa\u2019s needs, \nthe trend towards progress should lead us to explore \nother innovative financing mechanisms available to \nour countries. Africa is no longer a zone of turmoil \nand humanitarian emergencies. Africa has become an \nemerging centre of opportunities and investments for \ninnovative and mutually beneficial partnerships.\n\n\nThe world has changed; Africa has also changed. \nLet us therefore change our paradigms and visions; let \nus change the way we look at the continent. \n\nChange is also needed for the reform of the Security \nCouncil. The Council\u2019s legitimacy is not derived \nonly from its status as the guarantor of the collective \nsecurity system; it is also and especially derived from \nthe representativeness that justifies its action in the \nname of and on behalf of all Member States.\n\nThis time last year, Mali was doubly affected by \na coup and a terrorist attack reminiscent of a bygone \nage. They were a source of great concern for us. \nSenegal, which remains active within United Nations \nMultidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission \nin Mali, welcomes the restoration of the territorial \nintegrity and constitutional legality of Mali. We \ncongratulate the people of Mali and their political \nleaders for that happy outcome. We strongly support \nthe national reconciliation efforts being made by the \nGovernment in the spirit of the Ouagadougou Political \nAgreement.\n\nToday, while the armed groups have been \ndefeated, the terrorist threat to the Sahel has not yet \nbeen definitively ended. It is only through ongoing, \ncoordinated and sufficiently deterrent action that we \n\n\n\f\nwill be able to address the emerging security challenges \non the African continent. It is urgent to make operational \nthe African rapid response force, proposed at the last \nAfrican Union summit.\n\nIn Guinea-Bissau, Senegal is supporting the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to successfully carry out the \nelectoral process. We urge our partner countries and \ninstitutions to pursue their support for the definitive \nresolution of the Guinea-Bissau crisis through the \ncountry\u2019s economic recovery, the crucial reform of \nthe defence and security sector, and the fight against \nillicit drug trafficking. We hope that similar attention \nwill be paid to the Central African Republic and to the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo in the legitimate \naspiration to peace, stability and the preservation \nof territorial integrity. Throughout Africa, we are \ncommitted to upholding respect for the African Union \nprinciples against anti-constitutional changes of \nGovernment, regardless of the process used.\n\nIn regard to the Middle East, Senegal expresses its \ndeep concern over the untold suffering of the Syrian \npopulation. We urge the Syrian Government to exercise \nrestraint and to comply with the Chemical Weapons \nConvention in the control and destruction of its arsenal \nof chemical weapons.\n\nIn its capacity as Chairman of the Committee on \nthe Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \nPeople, Senegal is following the resumption of the \nIsraeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. It is a courageous \nand responsible act because it translates the vision of \ntwo States, Israel and Palestine, living within secure \nand internationally recognized borders. We therefore \ncall for a halt to acts likely to affect that perspective, \nnotably the ongoing establishment of settlements on \nPalestinian land by the Israeli Government.\n\nOn 24 September, Senegal joined other countries \nin launching the international campaign for the fight \nagainst sexual violence in armed conflict. Sexual \nviolence in conflict is an act of unbearable cruelty for \nthe victims and their families. It is a war crime and \na serious violation of human dignity and universal \nconscience. In the name of our common humanity, it \nis time to act to prevent and stop such horrors. It is \ntime to act so that victims will no longer feel alone in \ntheir suffering, which destroys the very foundations of \nsociety. It is time to act so that the perpetrators and \ntheir accomplices in those crimes are tracked down \neverywhere, prosecuted and punished in a manner \ncommensurate with the atrocities of their crimes.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to join other delegations \nat this gathering in congratulating you, Mr. President, on \nyour election to the presidency of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-eighth session. I am sure that under your \nguidance and through your excellent diplomatic skills \nwe will have a rich exchange of ideas and a fruitful \noutcome. I also wish to extend my congratulations and \ngratitude to your predecessor, Vuk Jeremi., for his \nsuccessful stewardship of the previous session of the \nGeneral Assembly. My deepest appreciation also goes \nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, whose \npassion and commitment have been instrumental in the \nwork of the organization.\n\nI will start by taking the Assembly back a few years. \nAll here will certainly remember how not too long ago \nthe world waited in anticipation and hope for the clock \nto push past midnight to the year 2000. As with most \nfresh starts, the new millennium brought with it a sense \nof promise and, indeed, something extraordinary was \ntaking place.\n\nFor the first time in history, Governments \nhad committed themselves to \u201cwalk the talk\u201d by \nadhering to a set of measurable targets aimed at \nlifting millions out of poverty by the year 2015. The \nso-called Millennium Development Goals were bold \nand ambitious. They became national and global \npriorities, setting Government policies and generating \na strong commitment across wide areas towards their \nattainment. Failure, it was felt, was not an option.\n\nUndoubtedly, there have been remarkable \nsuccesses. The number of people living in extreme \npoverty has fallen, as have poverty rates. Access to \nsources of clean water has improved. The proportion \nof urban slum dwellers has declined substantially, and \nthere has been visible improvement in the areas of \nhealth and education.\n\nYet, as significant as those achievements are, we \nare now at a watershed moment. The international \ncommunity has already recognized the need to push \nthe Goals further, beyond 2015, and to see that they \nbecome sustainable development goals. An important \nstock-taking exercise has been taking place so as to \nensure that no one is left behind, that no human being \nfeels merely like a scrap of life, living at the edge of \nexistence.\n\nIt would be easy for us to think of poverty as \nbelonging elsewhere, if we did not see it all around us. \nWe have the luxury of exercising wilful blindness to \nmalnutrition and disease, pretending that they belong \nto a different culture, to a different nationality, to a \nfictitious world that is wiped away as easily as flipping \na television channel. It would also be easy for us to think \nthat we can be altruistic, since we are lucky enough to \nlive without want. \n\nBut we are not here today to be blind. What brings \nus together at the General Assembly, year after year, \nto hear speech after speech, is a longing to belong. We \nwant to be part of something bigger, something that \ngoes beyond our self-imposed borders of language, \nculture and tradition. We want to belong to that global \nsea of peoples sharing a single purpose. That longing or \nneed to come together tugs at our hearts with hope and \nempathy for those at the margins of humankind. We \nwant to do something worthwhile. We want to commit \nour intelligence to being effective agents of change. \n\u201cMake poverty history,\u201d we once heard, and indeed we \nhave worked towards that aim. \n\nBut, as we hold those noble aims high, we also \nquestion whether our plan is a priority, whether it \nwill fit within our national budget or our political life \ncycles. And then we pause to consider our options, to \nchoose what will hurt us the least. The poor do not have \nthe luxury of granting us time to take our decisions. \nHumankind cannot wait for a better time, when there \nis no financial crisis. We, the international community, \nneed to forge ahead with determination to reach all our \ngoals. \n\nI am proud to note today Malta\u2019s long-standing \nhistory of solidarity with other nations all over the \nworld. Our accession to the European Union took that \nsolidarity a step further, and my country assumed \n\n\n\f\nresponsibilities and obligations in the context of \nproviding overseas development assistance to \ndeveloping countries. That remains a cornerstone of \nMalta\u2019s international relations, and we remain firmly \nengaged in seeking the eradication of poverty and the \nsustainable development of societies in need. We are \nproud to form part of the European Union, which is the \nworld\u2019s largest donor of development aid, and we are \ncommitted to reaching the goals that we have set and to \nbeing a reliable partner for those in need.\n\nI am equally proud to recall that this year marks the \ntwenty-fifth year since Malta proposed to the General \nAssembly that climate conservation should be part of \nhumankind\u2019s shared concerns, a concept that launched \nthe process leading to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change. Malta is proud to have \nbeen at the forefront of that discussion. We are adamant \nabout keeping the issue alive, for we are conscious of \nthe fact that climate change hits hardest the world\u2019s \nmost vulnerable.\n\nIn defining a common vision for the future, we \nbelieve that the eradication of poverty and the promotion \nof sustainable development must be at the heart of the \npost-2015 development framework. In the words of the \nformer President of South Africa, Mr. Nelson Mandela, \n\n\u201c[o]vercoming poverty is not a gesture of charity. \nIt is an act of justice. Like slavery and apartheid, \npoverty is not natural. It is man-made and it can be \novercome and eradicated by the actions of human \nbeings.\u201d \nMalta is committed to continuing to engage with its \ninternational partners in developing a post-2015 global \ndevelopment agenda that delivers on the promise of a \nbetter and fairer world for all.\nMalta also understands the need to act in other \nvery tangible ways. When rickety boats laden with \nirregular migrants reach our shores, which happens \neach and every day, we see the suffering, we feel the \nloss of dignity etched on people\u2019s faces. We understand \nthat they are caught in a web of poverty and criminal \nexploitation. We feel for those fleeing persecution and \npoverty. They are desperately searching for safety and \nprosperity. We do everything we can to provide them \nwith the help they need, offering refuge and respite.\n\nYet Malta cannot do that alone. The international \ncommunity must do more in the face of an ongoing \nsituation that is nothing but tragic evidence of our global \nfailures. It would be easy to flip channels once again, \nto \u201cpark it in someone else\u2019s back yard\u201d. But it is not \nsomeone else\u2019s problem. Irregular immigration, human \ntrafficking and modern-day slavery are everyone\u2019s \nproblem. We all have to play a part in solving it, not \nonly regionally but also globally.\n\nThere needs to be a sustained evolution in our \nthinking. At the threshold of the year 2015, we urge \nfellow nations not only to think beyond the current \nMillennium Development Goals and how to ensure \ntheir sustainability, but also to think of other goals that \ncould be included. There can be no unfinished business. \nThere can be no sustainable development goals without \npeace, without fighting corruption, without respect for \nhuman rights and without economic equality, which is \nthe social justice issue of our time. \n\nThe news headlines may not shock us anymore, but \nthose living in fear of losing their lives and those of \ntheir families do not live in order to make news. They \nlook to survive. Whether scrapping for food or seeking \nshelter from bullets, whether hiding their daughters to \nprevent them from falling victim to rape as a tool of \nwar or keeping sons from being forcibly recruited as \nchild soldiers, millions of people all over the world live \ndreading tomorrow. Each day they die a little bit more.\n\nWe bear responsibility for not safeguarding their \nsense of belonging as equal human beings on this planet. \nMalta firmly believes that the United Nations can and \nmust do more to safeguard human dignity and stir the \nconscience of humankind. No undertaking can be as \nfundamental as addressing the needs of the peoples of \nthe world, and no organization is better situated to see \nthat that can be done than the United Nations.\n\nMalta\u2019s geostrategic location makes it look most \nclosely at that which surrounds it. We are proud to be a \npeople of the sea, of a Mediterranean Sea that has given \nus life and marked our history. We are proud of our \ncontributions towards the health of that sea, the many \nexchanges that we support and the good relations we \nmaintain with all our neighbours, North and South. \n\nBut we are also troubled by the conflicts and \nsuffering that we see around us. Waves of new \ntomorrows and hopeful struggles for democracy in \nNorth Africa have given way to new realities that were \nunthinkable when the Millennium Development Goals \nwere drawn up. Sectarian strife, religious tensions and \npower struggles have halted or reversed the progress \nof development. It is almost correct to say that the \n\n\n\f\nMediterranean Sea is at a boiling point and that the \nnext conflict \u2014 one over scarce resources, contested \nborders or even cultural offences \u2014 is just waiting to \nhappen. But there can be no stalemate or acceptance of \nthe status quo if we truly believe that the peoples of the \nMediterranean deserve better. No violations of human \nrights or shaky institutions can be accepted if we are \nto look truly holistically at a new positive agenda for \nhumankind. The deepening links between the lives of \npeoples across countries demand coordinated global \naction. We must face that challenge.\n\nMalta firmly believes that more can be done by \nthe community of nations gathered here to support the \nfragile democracies that are struggling to take root \nwhere dictators formerly ruled. More can and should \nbe done to ensure that the economies of the region are \nable to flourish, that intraregional trade is supported \nand that cultural exchanges are fostered. More needs \nto be done to stop the violence and bloodshed that risk \nbecoming the norm for those of us who see the evolution \nof events.\n\nMalta calls upon the international community to \nlook with compassion on the innocents in Syria. That \nis a humanitarian catastrophe with no end in sight \u2014 a \nhorrendous and indiscriminate tragedy. Each child\u2019s \ndeath and each mother\u2019s wail should shame us all. People \nare morally outraged around the world, and justifiably \noutraged, for there can never be any justification for the \nappalling suffering that is taking place. \n\nThe Mediterranean Sea basin remains awash with \npromise but polluted with pain and prejudice. The \nMiddle East remains a hate-filled maelstrom and the \nmost explosive region in the world. How many more \nneed to die, not just in that region but everywhere \nelse because of conflict and terrorism? How many \nmore need to leave all their belongings to join hurried \nconvoys, fearful of losing their lives? How much longer \ncan the rights of others be ignored and trampled upon \nwhile others enjoy their perceived rights? We need to \nstop that wildfire. We need to stop the further descent \ninto brutality and carnage. Those responsible must be \nbrought to international justice.\n\nMalta is convinced that we cannot start talking of \na post-2015 agenda if we cannot solve our differences \ntoday. We do not have a carte blanche privilege to be \nimmune and indifferent, for the cost of our inaction \nis greater than the cost of our effort and commitment. \nConflict saps the focus from our goals. It drains our \nresources and stifles our potential. The United Nations \nfamily, committed as it is to the purposes of peace and \nprosperity among nations, understands that. \n\nMalta firmly believes that true peace in our time \nneeds to be the overriding goal, the one target to which \nwe should all aspire and for which we should all work. \nWe need to ensure stable and peaceful societies if \nwe want to take the Millennium Development Goals \nfurther. The opportunities for all to thrive are at hand. \nThe United Nations is and should be the force field to \nwhich all nations gravitate in order to solve differences \nand push boundaries together. \n\nOur global goals and commitments cannot be solely \ntime-bound but must also be outcome-oriented. We \nneed to think inclusively and holistically. Post-2015, we \nshould not be looking towards rebooting, but towards \ncontinuity with greater purpose and greater ambition. \nFewer people dying every day is a great achievement, \nbut more people truly living is an astounding victory \nfor all.\n\nHowever, to get there we have to realize that \neveryone has an equal voice. People need to be involved \nin decision-making, since it affects their lives and their \nlivelihoods. They should be foremost in our minds as we \nconsider the world\u2019s natural resources and tackle global \nconcerns such as climate change. There is never only \none way of doing things. We can achieve our targets \nonly if we listen to the people whom we are meant to \nrepresent and make them part of the decision-making \nprocess.\n\nA few weeks ago, a young girl, Malala, from \nPakistan, spoke in this very Hall of her dream for \ngirls to get an education and wield the power of the \npen. Yesterday, at a gathering I attended, she said that \neveryone should send books, not bombs. \n\nThirteen years ago, our leaders had a dream: to live \nup to the millennium moment and to better peoples\u2019 lives. \nAs we approach the year 2015, we need to remember the \nhope and determination we felt as we crossed into the \nnew millennium, that determination to make the world \na somewhat better place through the goals we reach \ntogether. We need to carry that forward and continue \nto make dreams happen. Every day, millions of people \naround the world dream of something more than a scrap \nof a life. Indeed, there are no scraps of life.\n"

        "file_text": "I have \ngreat pleasure in participating in the current session of \nthe General Assembly to discuss the vital issue of post-\n2015 sustainable development and the achievement of \nits goals, which we all hope to be able to accomplish.\n\nHaving overcome the serious consequences of \nthe economic, political and social policies pursued by \nthe former regime, which were not based on scientific \ngrounds but on the regime\u2019s personal reckless whims, \nIraq has sought to translate what was agreed upon \nby world leaders in 2000, notably the development \ngoals, into practical and concrete steps. By adopting \nplans, strategies and enacting laws that provide for \nthe necessary mechanisms, Iraq has endeavoured to \nachieve the essence of sustainable development, namely, \nthe integration of its three dimensions: economic, \nenvironmental and social.\n\nIraq has been working on financial and monetary \npolicies to increase the financial flows to its public \nbudget, which is expected to reach approximately \n$150 billion in 2015, 40 per cent of which is envisioned \nto be allocated to the requisite investment expenditure in \norder to provide basic services, improve infrastructure \nand strengthen the Iraqi economy.\n\nIraq is expected to achieve steady growth in the \neconomic sectors through its 2013-2017 development \nplan. However, oil is still the main engine driving the \nother sectors, thanks to Iraq\u2019s abundant oil and gas \nreserves, which surpass confirmed reserve estimates \nby a very large margin. Estimates put the potential of \nextractable oil reserves at 250 billion barrels and that of \ngas at more than 250 trillion cubic feet.\n\n\n\f\nWe expect to double oil production by the end of the \n2013-2017 development plan, with a steady increase in \noil exports, which are expected to reach approximately \n3,750,000 barrels per day in 2015. Therefore, the 2010-\n2014 development plan focuses on environmental \nsustainability and the green economy in Iraq. Strategic \ngoals have been identified for the aforementioned \nplan and for the 2013-2017 National Development \nPlan, which was recently approved by the Council of \nMinisters, as follows:\n\nFirst, a poverty alleviation strategy will be \nadopted as one of the components for the attainment \nof sustainable development. The poverty rate fell from \n23 per cent in 2007 to 19 per cent in 2012, and it is \nhoped that it will fall further, to 16 per cent, in 2017.\n\nSecond, the unemployment rate was reduced from \n15 per cent in 2007 to 11 per cent in 2012, with an \nexpected decline to 6 per cent in 2017.\n\nThird, the average per capita income increased \nfrom $3,000 in 2009 to nearly $6,000 in 2012, with an \nannual growth rate of 15.9 per cent, clearly indicating \nnoticeable economic progress.\n\nFourth, infant mortality must be reduced to \n18 deaths per 1,000 births in 2017. It is noteworthy that \nthose figures fell from 32 deaths per 1,000 births in \n2011 to 22 deaths per 1,000 births in 2013. The plan also \naims at reducing the mortality rate for children under \nfive years of age to 24 deaths per 1,000 live births in \n2017, following the decline from 37 in 2011 to 28 deaths \nin 2013.\n\nFifth, primary school enrolment must increase to \n95 per cent in 2017 from its 2012 figure of 92 per cent.\nSixth, the plan focuses on increasing secondary school \nenrolment to 40 per cent and that of universities to \n20 per cent by 2017.\n\nSeventh, the plan works to curb desertification \nthrough the expansion of land reclamation, where \napproximately 4 million dunums have been reclaimed. \nWe hope to reclaim 2.5 million additional dunums by \nthe end of the plan.\n\nEighth, it also advocates utilizing modern \ntechniques in irrigation and increasing the latent \nenergy of water resources by focusing on the economic \nexploitation thereof.\n\nNinth, it plans to minimize the quantities of burned \ngases associated with oil production by devising plans \nfor full investment therein in 2015.\n\nTenth, it is hoped that, by beginning the \nimplementation of a housing programme for the poor \nand limited-income people, 1 million housing units will \nbe available by the end of the plan.\n\nEleventh, the plan also includes achieving self-\nsufficiency in terms of electricity production, which \nis envisioned to reach 22,000 megawatts in 2015. That \nmeans a 15 per cent surplus over peak consumption, \nwhile the production of electricity in 2003 was around \n2,500 megawatts.\n\nIn that connection, we deem it necessary to \nemphasize the following significant points during the \nsixty-eighth session.\n\nFirst, Iraq calls for strengthened international \ncooperation, particularly South-South cooperation, and \nwe call upon the international community to fulfil its \nfinancial obligations in relation to achieving sustainable \ndevelopment.\n\nSecond, we favour facilitating the transfer of \ntechnology to developing countries, so as to reduce \nthe gap between them and the developed world and \ncontribute to solving the problems caused by global \nwarming and climate change.\n\nThird, we aim to address the problems caused by \nwater scarcity, which has destabilized certain regions \nof the world, and we stress the need to determine fair \nwater quotas among riparian States on international \nrivers.\n\nFourth, we want to extend special support for people \nsuffering from the effects of international conflict and \ninternational economic sanctions, which constitute \nsignificant obstacles to the attainment of sustainable \ndevelopment.\n\nFifth, we intend to appropriately address pressures \ncaused by unsustainable production and consumption \npatterns, particularly in the areas of deforestation, water \nscarcity, food waste and elevated carbon emissions.\n\nSixth, we will focus on building effective and \naccountable institutions; promoting the rule of \nlaw, property rights, the freedom of expression and \ninformation, in addition to the administration of justice \nand the fight against corruption.\n\nSeventh, we want to ensure that the post-2015 \nplan is underpinned by a new spirit of solidarity, \nresponsibility, cooperation and integration built on a \ncommon understanding of our humanity and on mutual \n\n\n\f\nrespect through the involvement of more participants \nfrom among women, the poor, civil society and local \ngovernments, academia and philanthropic institutions \nand charities.\n\nEighth, we will advocate for the need for \nGovernments to play a leading role in the field of \neducation and the need to recognize that education \nis a shared responsibility between families, local \ncommunities and civil society organizations, which all \nmust contribute to the improvement and development of \neducation and its ways and means.\n\nNinth, in addition to securing international \ncooperation and integration to help address the issues of \nsustainable development and the fight against extreme \npoverty, we hope to include, as one of the priorities, \nthe achievement of the objectives of sustainable \ndevelopment beyond 2015 and the elimination of \nviolence against women, and to achieve gender equality \nwith appropriate work and decision-making positions, \nas well as comprehensive economic and social security..\n\nTenth, we stress the importance of existing \nstandards in the field of human rights, the right to \ncompensation for victims and equity in cases of human \nrights violations.\n\nEleventh, we look forward to the completion of \ntasks by the Working Group that came out of the United \nNations Conference on Sustainable Development, on \nfinancing for development, as well as to the creation \nof sound foundations in the field of financing the \nsustainable development goals and the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda in a sustainable and predictable \nfashion.\n\nI must stress, however, that no pre-2015 or post-\n2015 development is attainable with the existence \nof organized terrorism, which thrives on the blood \nof innocents and claims their lives. That scourge \nhas adopted extremism as its approach, death as its \ncraft, violence as its means, hatred as its culture and \nsenseless and indiscriminate murder as its hobby and \npastime. Such a phenomenon calls for a strict and \npragmatic stance by the entire world, so as to face up \nto terrorism\u2019s brutal, ferocious, crazed and destructive \nattacks. International cooperation must seek to dry up \nthe financial, intellectual and armament resources of \nterrorism, so as to save humanity from that scourge and \nthe universe from its effects and dangers and the harm \nit inflicts.\n\nWe also wish to reiterate that no sustainable \ndevelopment can be achieved while the drums of war \nare beating in more than one place in the world, because \nthe concepts of peace, development and life cannot be \nupheld in conjunction with the will to bring about death, \nwar and genocide. Nor can development be achieved in \nthe absence of peace and security. There will therefore \nbe no political stability or social development without \npeaceful coexistence, security and stability, where \nhuman beings can rest and have shelter.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Iraq reiterates its calls and \ninitiatives for a peaceful solution for each and every \nland where gunfire, bloodshed and the smell of death \nprevail, and where people witness scenes of destruction. \nThat is because the logic of force cannot produce peace, \nnor can instruments of death or war mills bring about \nsecurity or create development or growth.\n\nHence, we in Iraq, whose people have suffered \ntremendously from the horrors of war caused by the \nrecklessness and folly of the defunct Saddam regime, \nare deeply concerned by the worsening events and \ntense situation on our borders with Syria, a country \nwith which we have borders over 600 kilometres long. \nThat is why we consider the Syrian armed conflict a \nserious threat to our security and stability and to the \nintegrity of our land and people.\n\nFor that reason, we insist on putting forward our \ninitiative to resolve the Syrian crisis politically in order \nto avoid a devastating humanitarian disaster unfolding \nin our neighbouring country and on our borders, which \ncould undermine all aspects of the development, \nstability and prosperity that we and other States aspire \nto achieve in our vitally important region. Therefore, \nI invite the Assembly to support the Iraqi initiative \nin its effort to ensure peace, security and stability. \nOtherwise, developments in the region could take an \nunpredictable turn.\n\nOur region is beleaguered by concerns that regional \nand large-scale wars may erupt or be triggered by a small \nspark. No one can guess the scale, trends, trajectory or \nduration of such conflicts. There can be no hope for \nsustainable development, stability or prosperity in a \nregion that is already fragile, volatile, explosive and \ncomplex. That is the message of the Government and \nthe people of Iraq to the Assembly.\n\nIn the aftermath of the fall of the dictatorial regime, \nIraq has opted for democratic mechanisms as the sole \nmeans of ensuring the peaceful rotation of power, for \n\n\n\f\nwe believe in the freedom, dignity and rights of human \nbeings. We have adopted an open-door foreign policy in \nour relations with the international community, and are \nalways looking for common denominators to overcome \ndisagreement through positive dialogue based on \njustice and responsible involvement with neighbouring \ncountries, our region and the world.\n\nWe are firmly convinced that peaceful solutions \nare the most effective means to settle all problems \nbetween peoples, nations and Governments. We reject \nviolence, terrorism and aggression, irrespective of \ntheir sources. Internally, we have called for tolerance, \nnational reconciliation and cooperation, with a view to \nattaining communal coexistence, social peace, stability \nand prosperity. These principles were formally adopted \nby the National Conference for Social Peace that was \nheld recently in Baghdad and signed with the code of \nnational honour by most of Iraq\u2019s leaders and national \nrepresentatives.\n\nIraq suffered more than two decades under \ninternational sanctions because of the invasion of \nbrotherly Kuwait under the previous regime. However, \ntoday the new Iraq has managed, through its cooperation \nwith the international community and the development \nof good-neighbourly relations with Kuwait, to overcome \nthe effects of the sanctions. Furthermore, Iraq worked \nwith the Security Council towards the adoption of \nits resolution 2107 (2013), of 27 June 2013, which put \nan end to Iraq\u2019s obligations under Chapter VII of the \nCharter of the United Nations. Thus, the crises and \nproblems suffered by the two brotherly countries of \nIraq and Kuwait are now part of the past. Today, we \nlook forward together to developing our new relations \nas a springboard and a solid foundation for a prosperous \nfuture for generations to come that will have positive \neffects on the entire region.\n\nOur faith in humankind does not preclude us \nfrom taking up the just cause of the oppressed, the \ndisadvantaged and the vulnerable, or from showing \nsolidarity with the just causes of our Arab and Islamic \nnation, raising our voices in defence of their rights, their \nhumanity and their causes. Foremost among those is the \ncause of the Palestinian people, who are still suffering \nfrom systematic oppression and ongoing settlement \nactivities that violate their rights and threaten their \nidentity and existence. The situation requires the world \nand its international institutions to assume their due \nroles and responsibilities and stand by a people who \nseek only the realization of their rights, freedom, \njustice and independence and the establishment of a \nviable Palestinian State, without which the Middle East \nregion will remain prone to tension and instability.\n\nFor the sake of a Middle East living in peace and \nsecurity, we reiterate the call for the establishment of a \nMiddle East free of nuclear weapons, with an emphasis \non the need to hold the Helsinki conference on the \nestablishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone as soon \nas possible. The failure of international efforts in that \narea would adversely affect the credibility of the Treaty \non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which in \nturn could lead to an arms race, raising the levels of \nviolence, tension and instability.\n\nWhile the United Nations is our agreed forum \nfor international cooperation to address the problems \nand challenges that we face through multilateral \nnegotiations, we believe that the time has come to \nreform its bodies, in particular the Security Council, \nas the primary body responsible for international peace \nand security, in order to make them consistent with the \naspirations of the peoples of the world in the twenty-\nfirst century and more representative, transparent and \nable to meet the challenges they face.\n\nIn conclusion, I take this opportunity to express, \non behalf of the Iraqi people, our sincere thanks and \nprofound appreciation to all those who have contributed \nto helping Iraq lift the burden of Chapter VII from its \nshoulders. We wish each and every nation all over the \nworld a free, safe and secure life with dignity and a \npromising prosperous future. Peace be upon the \nAssembly.\n"

        "file_text": "I am extremely \npleased that a son of the Caribbean \u2014 and one with such \na wealth of experience and tested diplomatic skills \u2014 is \npresiding over the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth \nsession. I commend the Secretary-General, His \nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his untiring efforts \nto promote international peace and development, and I \nthank him for his exemplary leadership.\n\nThe theme for our debate, \u201cThe post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage\u201d, catapults \ndevelopment to the centre of the United Nations \nagenda, impelling us to elaborate a meaningful and far-\nreaching development framework for the benefit of all. \nOur deliberations and actions during this session must \ntherefore send a clear message of hope to the many \nmillions who, sadly, are still living in poverty and \ninequity. Let us redouble our efforts to fight against the \nscourge of poverty. It was the late Jamaican national \nhero, Marcus Mosiah Garvey, who aptly said:\n\n\u201cPoverty is a hellish state to be in. It is no \nvirtue. It is a crime. To be poor is to be hungry \nwithout possible hope of food; to be sick without \nhope of medicine; to be tired and sleepy without \na place to lay one\u2019s head; to be naked without the \nhope of clothing; to be despised and comfortless. \nTo be poor is to be a fit subject for crime and hell.\u201d\nToo many of the world\u2019s citizens are facing that \nreality. We need to fulfil the Millennium Declaration \n(resolution 55/2), which entrusted to us the responsibility \nto chart a path towards development underpinned by \na commitment to eradicate poverty on the basis of a \nglobal partnership.\n\nAs the deadline for the attainment of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals draws near, with under 1,000 days \nremaining, we face many challenges, including the \nglobal economic and financial crisis, climate change, \nnatural disasters, high levels of debt and conflict. \nWith the limited time remaining, it is imperative for \nus to accelerate our efforts. Anything less would be a \ndisservice to our people.\n\nWhile we contemplate a post-2015 development \nframework, we must also complete unfinished business \n\nin the reduction of extreme poverty and hunger, \ncombating HIV/AIDS, halting and reversing the \nincidence of malaria and tuberculosis and increasing \naccess to reproductive health care. In our deliberations \non a post-2015 development agenda, we must determine \nhow best to shape a global compact that is universal and \npeople-centred and that strikes the balance between \nthe need for robust economic growth, job creation \nand poverty eradication and the equally important \nneed to preserve and protect the environment. Our \ndeliberations have to take into account the special needs \nof disadvantaged groups of countries, in particular the \nvulnerable group of small island developing States \n(SIDS), which are grappling with climate change, sea-\nlevel rise and the need to deal with new and emerging \neconomic and social situations.\n\nWe are pleased that international attention will \nbe focused on small island developing States in 2014, \nwhen the international community will observe the \nInternational Year of Small Island Developing States. \nThe success of the Samoa Conference in 2014 will \ndepend on strong international support for and the \nmainstreaming of SIDS issues in all activities across \nthe United Nations system.\n\nA sustainable approach to development should \ninclude people with disabilities in the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda. It should also provide for the \nprevention and control of non-communicable diseases \nand additional financial resources to sustain the global \nfight against HIV/AIDS.\n\nAnother major threat to development is the high \nincidence of road crashes. I call on all countries to \ntake the challenge of reducing injuries and fatalities \nresulting from road crashes and traffic accidents more \nseriously as a crucial policy issue.\n\nThere is an urgent need for innovative and \nsustainable financing to underpin our development \nefforts. Reforms should be undertaken in a manner \nthat will assist middle-income developing countries \nto deal with the challenges they face. Those reforms \nmust address public debt sustainability and review the \nclassification system of middle-income developing \ncountries with a view to coming up with more relevant \nand appropriate measures of development.\n\nThere is an urgent need for greater focus on job \ncreation, including for unemployed youth. I note that \nthe International Labour Organization has estimated \nthat global unemployment will rise to 202 million \nthis year. That alarming statistic is overshadowed by \nestimate of the global working poor, which is in the \norder of 869 million, almost 400 million of whom \nlive in extreme poverty. Growth in joblessness is \nreflected in rural and urban pockets of poverty and \nsocial deprivation. Increased investment in developing \ncountries with a focus on job creation is an avenue that \nmust be actively pursued.\n\nWe need to provide more assistance for people \nto cope with daily life, as growth and prosperity are \nunevenly distributed and the most vulnerable are at \nrisk of falling through the cracks, being overlooked \nand failing to achieve a decent quality of life. Social \nprotection schemes should work effectively to provide \nfor basic needs and encourage target groups to pursue \nself-advancement while facilitating empowerment \nand fostering greater inclusiveness. As countries like \nJamaica implement strategies to deal with indebtedness \nand also encourage growth and investment, it is \ncritical that international financial institutions and \nmultilateral and other development partners recognize \nthe importance of social protection mechanisms.\n\nAs we forge the agenda for development for the \nnext decade and beyond, we do so in part on behalf of \na group that is very close to my heart \u2014 our children. \nThe future we want, the future we craft, the future we \nachieve will be our legacy to our children. We must \nredouble our efforts to safeguard their rights and \nenhance their development. Despite limited resources, \nJamaica continues to make every effort to meet its \nobligations to its children. We condemn violence and \nabuse against our children and reaffirm our commitment \nto safeguarding and promoting the rights of children \neverywhere. We must leave no child behind.\n\nThe issue of human trafficking is of paramount \nconcern. I am always mindful of the horrors and evils \nof slavery, both in history and in its modern-day form. \nI am particularly moved by the knowledge that young \ngirls and boys are torn daily from the bosom of their \nfamilies, taken to strange lands, placed in subhuman \nconditions and forced to perform unspeakable acts. We \nmust unite in our efforts to eliminate that transnational \nscourge and bring an end to human trafficking among \nour women, men and children. We must ensure that in \nthese modern times we do not have a re-enactment of \nslavery.We must stamp it out wherever it exists and bring \nthe perpetrators to justice. We must protect our future \ngenerations. Never again should anything resembling \nslavery be tolerated anywhere.\n\n\n\f\nJamaica is proud to lead the efforts, in collaboration \nwith the countries of the Caribbean Community and \nmembers of the African Union, to have the permanent \nmemorial to the victims of slavery and the transatlantic \nslave trade erected here at the United Nations. The \nunveiling of the winning design of the permanent \nmemorial earlier this week signals an important chapter \nin our journey to honour the memory of the millions of \nmen and women who were subject to untold atrocities. \nWhen I attended the unveiling I was reminded of the \nwords of our reggae icon, Bob Marley:\n\n\u201cOld pirates, yes, they rob I;\nSold I to the merchant ships,\nMinutes after they took IFrom the bottomless pit.\nBut my hand was made strongBy the hand of the Almighty.\nWe forward in this generationTriumphantly.\u201d\nWe are grateful for the generous contributions \ntowards the erection of the memorial, and we encourage \nthe international community to continue to show \nfinancial support for that important initiative.\n\nJamaica supports the call for an international \ndiscussion in a non-confrontational manner on the \nquestion of reparations. We fully support the initiative \nto proclaim a decade for people of African descent.\n\nThe quest for development will not be complete \nwithout requisite attention being paid to peace and \nsecurity. My heart goes out to the families of the victims \nof the horrific attack in Kenya. Transnational organized \ncriminal enterprises wreak havoc on economies and \nchallenge the capacity of States to deal with those \nthreats. No country is immune to the direct or indirect \neffects of the scourge of transnational crime. Increased \ncollaboration is necessary in confronting such threats \nto human development. To that end, we welcome the \nrecent opening for signature of the landmark Arms \nTrade Treaty in June of this year, which represents one \nof many steps that the international community must \ntake towards defeating terrorism, crime and violence. \nJamaica is currently embarking on the process leading \nto ratification of the Treaty.\n\nBilateral and regional cooperation through \ninformation-sharing, capacity-building and assistance \nare integral to dealing with crime, violence and security \nissues. \n\nWe remain deeply concerned about the suffering of \nthe people in Syria and join the international community \nin condemning the use of chemical weapons. We \nwelcome the recent positive steps taken by the Security \nCouncil. Jamaica remains firmly committed to a just, \nlasting and peaceful solution to the situation in the \nMiddle East.\n\nTurning closer to home, the trade and economic \nembargo against our neighbour Cuba has caused its \npeople untold hardship. It has no place in the twenty-\nfirst century. We reiterate our call for an end to the \nembargo against Cuba and to extraterritorial measures \nthat target third-party countries.\n\nJamaica has never lost faith in the influence for \ngood that exists here at the United Nations. We are \nfully aware that the expectations and aspirations of \npeoples rest in our hands. At this pivotal moment in \nhistory, let us revitalize the partnership on which this \ngreat institution is built. I draw on the words of the civil \nrights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., when he said,\n\n\u201cThe ultimate measure of a man is not where he \nstands in moments of comfort and convenience \nbut where he stands at times of challenge and \ncontroversy.\u201d\nThe challenges and expectations of our time are \nindeed great. It falls to our generation to take a stand. \nNow is the time to act.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour for me to be \nhere today, as this it is my first time addressing this \nesteemed and respected body, the General Assembly, \nas President of Somalia. First, let me congratulate the \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth \nsession. \n\nI would also like to take this opportunity to thank \nthe United Nations for its unwavering support to \nSomalia. On 10 September 2012, when I was elected \nPresident of Somalia, it was the first time that we \nhad had a permanent Government following 22 years \nwithout a functioning State. Somalia could not have \ncompleted the transition last year without the assistance \nof the United Nations and all the countries that stood \nwith us during those difficult times.\n\nOne of the main purposes of the United Nations is \nto maintain international peace and security. Therefore, \nit is imperative that we stand together to ensure that \nthe world is peaceful and stable. Somalia and other \ncountries are still suffering and need the support \nof friends, allies and all members of this body, who \nmust come together to find ways to overcome all the \nchallenges that exist in this universe. \n\nIt is time to reflect on our collective progress and \nthe challenges and opportunities before us in our efforts \nto ensure that the world is free from conflict. I have no \ndoubt that if we collectively work hard and understand \nthe issue, become self-critical with our strategies and \nprovide all the necessary support and assistance to \nall countries that are struggling to bring peace and \nstability, we will prevail in achieving our main purpose \nin that universe. That struggle must be redoubled. \n\nWe strongly condemn the cruel and terrible attack \nin Nairobi\u2019s Westgate Mall and send our condolences to \nthe Kenyan people and the Government. The Westgate \nshopping mall attack in Nairobi demonstrates to the \nworld a number of important points.\n\nFirst, the battle against Al-Qaieda and its offshoots, \nsuch as Al-Shabaab in the Horn of Africa, is far from \nover. Al-Shabaab is indeed a national threat, but its \nconsequences have negative impacts on the region and \nthe entire world, not just for Somalia alone.\n\nSecondly, the fight against Al-Shabaab must be \nfought on many fronts \u2014 military, economic, political \nand ideological. Military, security and intelligence \nforces are crucial elements in the battle, but they are \nonly one part of the solution.\n\nThirdly, Al-Shabaab is down but it has not died. \nWe now need the tools to finish the job, and we call on \nour friends to remain resolute and to help us end the \nsituation. Our brave Somali forces, the African Union \n\n\n\f\nMission in Somalia (AMISOM) and Ethiopian forces \nneed help in fighting our enemies inside Somalia, yet \nthat is simply not enough. AMISOM must be reinforced \nand expanded. The small investment required for those \nenhancements is insignificant compared with the great \nexpense that will be needed later if the international \ncommunity does not help finish the job right now. \nFurthermore, we must not overreact but remain focused \non weakening and uprooting the terrorist bases, \nmilitarily and ideologically. In doing so, we must not \nunderestimate them, nor should we overestimate them \nand fall for their childish, irresponsible and useless \npropaganda.\n\nThose brutal terrorist organizations, wherever they \nmay be \u2014 in Nairobi, Mogadishu or elsewhere in the \nworld \u2014 have no mercy for humankind. But I reassure \nthe Assembly that we will fight and defeat Al-Shabaab \nin the deserts and in the towns, on digital and on social \nmedia. We will fight them on the airwaves and in the \nnewspapers. We challenge them in schools, colleges \nand universities, and we will overcome them. We have \ndefeated them militarily on the battlefield, and we must \nnow defeat their poisonous ideology with innovative \nstrategies, cutting-edge technologies, comprehensive \neducation and vigorous communication. That is the \ncommitment that we will fulfil, and I call on our partners \nto remain strong and stand shoulder to shoulder with \nKenya and with Somalia. Only if we remain resolute \nand together will we prevail.\n\nIn just one year, the cornerstones of a new Somalia \nhave been successfully and peacefully laid down. We \nhave made milestone achievements in security, public \nfinance management, reconciliation, political outreach \nand laying the foundations of good governance \nwith appropriate legislation in place. The federal \nGovernment of Somalia has now established the basis \nof a new public finance management system, which \nwe believe will enable our donors to agree to funding \narrangements with the confidence that funds will reach \ntheir intended recipients.\n\nThat is at the heart of the New Deal compact we \nsigned in Brussels earlier this month. The compact \nrepresents a paradigm shift in how the international \ncommunity engages with Somalia, and I welcome \nthat transformation wholeheartedly. The New Deal \nwill help Somalia preserve its unity and sovereignty \nand lay a strong foundation, 22 years on, for building \nreliable, transparent and accountable functioning State \ninstitutions that are respectful of the fundamental rights \nand freedoms and equality of its citizens.\n\nTo succeed, the New Deal must be more than words \nand frameworks. It must deliver on the ground. There are \nhuge expectations that the compact will revolutionize \nthe service-delivery efforts of the Government. We \nneed to transform the lives of our people, connect \nwith our citizens and enhance their well-being. In the \nmeantime, we have started a campaign to revitalize \nservice delivery in districts and regions throughout \nSomalia, to provide health care, and to enable access \nto clean water. We have launched, for the first time, an \ninitiative called \u201cGo to School\u201d. Under its auspices, we \nare planning to enrol 100,000 students in the schools \nin the current academic year, and 1 million students \nwill eventually be in school within the coming three \nyears. That is not without challenges, but we commit \nourselves and we will prevail.\n\nOn the other hand, I would like to present to the \nAssembly the political progress that we are making in \nSomalia. We believe that a political solution is the first \nstep in building a stable governance framework in our \ncountry. We have begun to lay the foundations for the \nreturn of effective, stable and representative governance \nin Somalia, the cornerstone of lasting peace.\n\nTo that end, Somalia should possess a full-\nfledged constitution reflecting a broad national \nconsensus on how we wish to govern ourselves. We \nmust complete the establishment of our federal system \nand advance the process of democratization through \nthe development of a multiparty electoral system. \nAccordingly, our Parliament has already passed \nlegislation establishing an independent Constitutional \nReview and Implementation Commission, as required \nby the provisional Constitution. We must move quickly \nto put in place other critical statutory bodies, including \na boundaries and federation commission and a national \nindependent electoral commission, the tasks of which \nwill be to guide our thinking and inform our actions \nand decisions in order to complete Somalia\u2019s journey to \nunity, stability and democracy.\n\nIn March, my Government signed an agreement \nwith the authorities in Puntland, framing our shared \ncommitment to implementing a federal system of \ngovernance, as agreed. On 27 August, we signed an \naccord that establishes an interim Juba Administration, \nwhich also aspires to become a federal member state \nin accordance with the Constitution. The agreement, \n\n\n\f\nachieved after long months of painstaking negotiations, \ndemonstrates what can be achieved through the \ncombination of Somali political leadership and the \nsteadfast support of our close neighbours.\n\nWe have begun similar processes elsewhere \nin Somalia, establishing interim administrations \nin the remaining regions to pursue the twin goals \nof peacebuilding and State-building across many \nregions in Somalia. Members of Parliament have also \nplayed a key role in all of those processes, working \nwith their constituencies and serving as a critical \nchannel of communication between the people of their \nconstituencies and the federal Government.\n\nWith the good offices of the Government of Turkey, \nwe have continued our dialogue with the authorities in \nSomaliland, underscoring our determination to preserve \nthe unity of the country, not by force and coercion, but \nthrough dialogue, mutual respect and understanding. \nSomali unity must be more than a rhetorical device; \nit must preserve and promote the dignity, equality \nand legitimate aspirations of all Somali citizens. By \nadhering to such principles, we are confident that our \ndialogue with Somaliland will not only continue, but \nwill eventually bear fruit.\n\nThose are major milestones, but enormous \nchallenges still lie ahead. These challenges were \nclearly articulated by the participants at the Vision 2016 \nConference convened on 2 September in Mogadishu, \nwhere some of the best minds in the country and from \nSomali communities living abroad came together \nto offer their remarkable experience, insights and \nexpertise in charting the way forward for the future \nof Somalia. At another major gathering just last week \nin Mogadishu, respected Somali religious leaders \nand elders from across the country announced their \ndetermination to have a future free from the intolerance \nand extremism that have taken root in recent years.\n\nWe are committed to ensuring that, in the course \nof the daily struggle to rebuild our country, we do not \nlose sight of the longer-term challenges ahead. We \nare announcing the Vision 2016 initiative, which is \na concerted effort under my leadership to complete \nthe Constitution, organize the federal system and \nprepare the ground for elections in 2016. We will need \ndirection, determination, discipline and human and \nfinancial resources if we are to succeed as we roll out \nthe concrete objectives and benchmarks set forth in the \ninitiative.\n\nFinally, people may ask why Somalia matters at this \ntime, but there is a huge amount at stake right now \u2014 the \nfuture of our country, the security of the region and the \nwider world, in the light, in particular, of the war against \nAl-Qaida in Somalia and the removal of the piracy \nstranglehold on the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean, \nwhich are indeed challenges that we share with the \nworld. The progress that has been made in Somalia on \nthose critical issues over the past years would not have \nbeen possible without the courageous support of the \nmember countries of the Intergovernmental Authority \non Development, the African Union through its troop-\ncontributing countries, and the ultimate sacrifice made \nby many brave African soldiers. We pay tribute to them, \nand we owe it to their memory to ensure that we do not \ntake a single step backwards.\n\nI would equally like to thank the European Union \nfor its leadership in organizing the recent conference in \nBrussels. I would also like to thank the Member States \nthat not only made the commitment to take part in the \nmeeting, but also showed great generosity in making \npledges to help the development and reconstruction of \nSomalia. We hope that others will do as they have done.\n\nWe welcome the new United Nations Assistance \nMission in Somalia (UNSOM), with which we are now \nworking to bring peace and stability to the country. \nUNSOM is doing a great job, and we look forward to \naddressing all outstanding issues together. UNSOM \nhas shown a commitment to bringing its offices back to \nSomalia. Tragically, the extremists, who are terrified of \nprogress, were able to kill innocent people in an attack \nagainst the United Nations compound in Mogadishu. \nI offer my sincere condolences to the United Nations \nand the families of the victims. The United Nations \nhas reacted mindfully and reiterated its support for \nSomalia. I thank the Organization for that courage and \ncommitment.\n\nWar is something we Somalis have experienced too \nmuch of in recent years, and we feel particular sadness \nwhen we look at Syria and see our brothers embarking \non a civil war that will only bring the ruin of the country. \nIt is much easier to start a war than to end one. After \ntwo years, the conflict in Syria is already entrenched. \nHatred has taken hold of the hearts of too many men \nand women, while a new generation of children has to \nendure a childhood full of suffering, with no education.\n\nAs a Somali who has lived through the world\u2019s \nlongest, most devastating civil war, I can speak with \n\n\n\f\nbitter experience of the legacies of war. We must not \nallow the use of chemical weapons against human beings \nin war or otherwise, let alone against children, women \nand vulnerable people. The international community \nmust assume its responsibility and send a powerful \nmassage to those who are responsible for the continued \nconflict in Syria. We must continue to encourage all \nsides in Syria and their international allies to realize \nthat the only way out of the tragedy is dialogue and \nnegotiation.\n\nBefore I conclude, let me reiterate that impunity has \nno place in the world, but selective justice and targeted \ntrials are against the principles of peace, justice and \nreconciliation. Regrettably, the trials of African leaders \nat the International Criminal Court have become \npolitically motivated, in contravention of agreed \nobjectives and principles. As a result, the wounds of \nconflict remain unhealed and the national unity and \ncohesion of many African countries is jeopardized.\n\nI would like to conclude by thanking the General \nAssembly and paying tribute to the dedicated support \nof its members. Together we can make Somalia strong \nagain. We have planted the seeds of a new Somalia. \nWe wish to see it grow into a tree standing tall in the \nAfrican bush, with deep roots binding it securely to its \nregion and offering shade and protection to its people \nas they rebuild their lives.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow \nme, at the outset to extend sincere my congratulations \nto Ambassador John Ashe, President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. We are confident \nthat he will ably guide the work of the Assembly during \nthis session. I also extend my thanks and gratitude \nto Mr. Vuk Jeremi., President of the Assembly at \nthe previous session, for his efforts. We wish to \nthank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his wise \nleadership of the Organization and for his interest in \nthe developments taking place in the world and in my \ncountry. \n\nIt is a felicitous coincidence that the sixty-eighth \nsession of the General Assembly coincides with the \ncelebrations in my country in honour of the September \nand October revolutions. Allow me, from this important \ninternational rostrum, to congratulate the great and \nvaliant people of Yemen on this important occasion \nand to commend the country and people of Yemen for \ntheir resilience and their sacrifices in emancipating \nthemselves from the yoke of colonization, injustice, \noppression and despotism. \n\nI also wish to congratulate the people of Yemen for \nwisely and patiently forging ahead on the path of change \nand modernization for more than 50 years and for their \ndetermination to rid themselves of all the remnants \nof the past. I commend them on their stewardship of \nthe historic political change, chief among them the \nimplementation of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) \ninitiative, with the support of international and regional \ncommunities. From this rostrum, I wish to commend \nmy country\u2019s youth for its leadership throughout the \ntransition process in building institutions, enhancing \nand promoting freedom and democracy, and building a \nnew Yemen where justice, liberty and good governance \nprevail. \n\nThe values of justice, freedom and equality, respect \nfor human rights and the maintenance of international \npeace and security are the main pillars and principles \non which the United Nations was established. Because \nof our firm belief in those values and principles, we \nhave always sought to implement and promote United \n\n\n\f\nNations instruments and to support peaceful coexistence \namong nations. Perhaps the lofty and noble purposes \nand principles enshrined in the Charter of the United \nNations and all its instruments served as inspiration in \nthe political settlement and the comprehensive national \ndialogue that we have been pursuing for more than six \nmonths.\n\nThose purposes and principles are also reflected in \ntwo aspects of the current situation. First is our desire \nfor coexistence and consensus, our rejection of violence \nand our preference for the language of dialogue and \nlogic and reason. The second aspect is the fact that \nYemen is considered a unique model that should be \nfollowed, given the tremendous change being witnessed \nin our region. The acute crisis that befell Yemen in 2011 \nreflected internal understanding and tolerance and a \ndesire for coordination with regional and international \npartners. \n\nIn that context, we wish to reiterate our thanks \nand appreciation to all those who stood by the people \nof Yemen and by the political settlement embodied in \nthe Gulf initiative, chief among them the Custodian of \nthe Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz \nAl-Saud; the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council \nand the GCC Secretary General, Mr. Abdul Latif bin \nRashid Al Zayani. I also extend my thanks to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon and to Security Council members \nfor visiting Yemen on two occasions. \n\nAs my country is a unique model among the \ncountries in which the Arab Spring is unfolding, those \nvisits have enhanced the new approach, which is based \non the GCC initiative and Security Council resolutions \non Yemen. We thank the five permanent members of the \nSecurity Council for their unified vision with regard to \nYemen, which made it possible for us to forge ahead \nwith the political process and crown it with success. \nWe also extend our appreciation to the League of \nArab States, the European Union, Germany and all the \nrelevant international organizations and institutions, as \nwell as to the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General \non Yemen, Mr. Jamal Benomar, for his efforts to achieve \nreconciliation between the parties in Yemen. \n\nAs the Assembly is aware, my country has made \ngreat strides in the implementation of the GCC initiative \nand its mechanisms. We are now turning to the second \nphase, that of concluding the work of the comprehensive \nNational Dialogue and forging ahead with our plan to \nshape our future. The results of this endeavour will lay \nthe foundations for the establishment of a new, modern \nYemen where democracy, the peaceful transfer of \npower, the promotion of freedom, justice, partnership, \nequality and equal opportunities for all citizens prevail. \nThose foundations will enhance the authority of the \nState, the rule of law, security, stability and the unity \nof Yemen. \n\nWe are also forging ahead with strengthening \nsecurity and stability in our country and restructuring \nthe military and security institutions, so as to bolster \ntheir main national task \u2014 to be loyal to the State \nrather than to parties or individuals. We are certain that \nour brethren and our friends will assist us in our new \nendeavour, namely, the drafting of the new constitution \nand the holding of a referendum on it, as well as in our \npreparations for the next presidential and parliamentary \nelections. \n\nThe achievements being made and that will be \nmade, in the ongoing political process depend heavily \non the support of the international community and on \nenhanced partnership and cooperation between the \ninternational community and Yemen, especially as \nthere are internal and external parties that continue \nto attack the will of the Yemeni people. Those parties \nare making every effort to obstruct the achievement \nof political settlements and to target all the factors of \nstability and the foundations of development in my \ncountry. Such acts require the appropriate international \nmeasures so as to deter and punish all those who are \ntrying to defeat this unique model in the region. \n\nThere are a multitude of factors at play, particularly \nthe increasing unemployment rate, growing levels \nof poverty, and poor social services in general. All \nthose factors exacerbate instability and create a fertile \nenvironment for the actions of extremist groups such \nas Al-Qaida. However, eliminating them effectively \nrequires all kinds of logistical, financial and technical \nsupport through practical programmes and plans that \ndo address not only the symptoms, but also the root \ncauses of those phenomena. \n\nWe need the international community\u2019s support \nin implementing our national counter-terrorism \nstrategy. That is why the fulfilment of pledges by donor \ncountries and the Friends of Yemen must be accelerated, \nparticularly since the Government of Yemen has been \nworking in partnership with donors to earmark and \nallocate all those funds to various development areas. \n\nI wish to take this opportunity to thank all our \ndonors, especially those who have already made good \n\n\n\f\non their pledges and financial commitments to Yemen. \nThat is particularly important in view of the fact \nthat Yemen, owing to its geographic location, social \ncomposition and economic status, has been plagued \nby various problems and challenges. They include the \nactivities of Al-Qaida and of cross-border organized \ncrime and national and international criminal groups \ntrafficking in drugs, weapons and people, as well as \nthe piracy off Yemen\u2019s coasts. Addressing all those \nproblems requires international cooperation for the \nsecurity of the country and the region as a whole.\n\nWe would also like to bring up the issue of refugees \nin Yemen, especially from the Horn of Africa. We \nhave been hosting more one million of them, with \nall the economic, social and security difficulties that \nsuch a situation entails. We are therefore calling on the \ninternational community and relevant organizations to \nhelp us to deal with the issue and mitigate its negative \nimpact on Yemen. We must find new ways and means \nto help the Government care for the refugees and help \nthem to return to their homes, especially since those \ncountries have lately seen their stability restored to \nsome degree.\n\nConflicts and bloody events, especially in the \nMiddle East, are contrary to the lofty goals of the United \nNations, which is why the international community \nmust revisit the structure and working methods of the \nOrganization and make the reforms necessary to enable \nit to effectively discharge its responsibilities for the \nmaintenance of international peace and security and \nto revitalize its role. In that regard, we should mention \nthe despair and frustration of many Arab and Muslim \nnations over the failure to end the Israeli occupation \nof Palestine, arrive at a just solution to the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict and put a stop to all the occupying \nPower\u2019s oppressive measures and practices and attempts \nto Judaize the holy city of Jerusalem, expand settlement \nactivities, detain Palestinian citizens and excavate \nillegally around the Al-Aqsa Mosque.\n\nWe also wish to denounce the use of chemical \nweapons, especially in Syria, by any party. We \ncall on all the parties in the Syrian conflict to stop \nthe bloodshed, agree to a dialogue and to work \ntowards a political settlement and reconciliation \nand reconstruction. We call on the international and \nregional parties concerned to intensify their efforts to \nachieve a peaceful settlement of the crisis. A \u201cGeneva \nII\u201d conference should be convened as soon as possible \nin order to put an end to the violence, killings and \nbloodshed in Syria. Recent events have demonstrated \nthe challenges facing the United Nations in this area, \nparticularly regarding the disagreement between \npermanent members of the Security Council, which was \na pretext for certain groups to opt for unilateral action \noutside the international legitimacy represented by the \nUnited Nations. The Council needs thorough reform for \nit to be able to carry out its primary task, which is the \nmaintenance of international peace and security and \nthe peaceful settlement of conflicts.\n\nConcerning the brotherly country of Somalia \nand our support for it, we call on the international \ncommunity to continue to stand by it in order to enable \nit to overcome its long legacy of conflict and suffering.\n\nFinally, I would like to thank the President and the \nSecretary-General once again."

        "file_text": "It is a great honour for me to address the Assembly \ntoday on behalf of Montenegro and to reaffirm our \ncommitment to the United Nations and its Charter.\n\nI wish to congratulate President Ashe on his \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-eighth session and to express the full support \nof the Montenegrin delegation to him personally and \nfor the programme he has put forward. I wish also to \nextend my gratitude to the President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session, Mr. Vuk Jeremi., \nour neighbour, for his energetic efforts and leadership, \nwhich contributed to dynamic and constructive \ndiscussions on various issues on the United Nations \nagenda. It is a special pleasure for me to pay tribute \nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his \ntireless efforts to build a safer and more prosperous \nworld.\n\nThe numerous challenges that the United Nations \nis currently facing are far more complex than previous \nones. Those challenges are such that all of us have to \nensure, through joint efforts, coordinated and efficient \naction to overcome them. That is our moral, collective \nobligation towards the well-being of future generations.\n\nThe challenge of achieving sustainable development \nand integrating its three dimensions is the greatest of \nthem all. It is encouraging that the General Assembly, \nbound by the Rio outcome document (resolution \n66/288, annex), is successfully addressing this priority. \nWith the establishment of the Open Working Group on \nSustainable Development Goals, the Intergovernmental \nCommittee of Experts on Sustainable Development \nFinancing and the High-level Political Forum, the \ninstitutional framework as a platform for substantive \nwork has been strengthened.\n\nIn that context, the role of the United Nations \nand the results of efforts to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015 are becoming \nmore important than ever. I am certain that the United \nNations, guided by the synergy and pragmatic approach \nof its Members and all stakeholders, will be able to \nrespond to that highly complex challenge. Such an \napproach will contribute to our well-being and a safer \nfuture for all of us, further strengthening the central \nrole of the United Nations in the system of global \ngovernance. \n\nTo that end, poverty eradication and the other \nunmet MDGs must remain at the heart of the post-\n2015 development agenda. We must define future \nsustainable development goals on the basis of the \nexperience and lessons learned from our success or \nfailure in accomplishing the tasks set by the Millennium \nDeclaration (resolution 55/2). Montenegro is working \ndiligently on the MDGs and is close to meeting them.\n\nOur sustainable development goals must be clear, \nuniversal, flexible and coherent, and represent a central \npart of the post-2015 global development agenda. They \nmust clearly reflect political commitment to sustainable \ndevelopment and promote economic development, \nsocial inclusion, the sustainable use of natural resources \nand protection of the environment as well peace and \nsecurity. As a member of the Open Working Group \non Sustainable Development Goals, Montenegro is \nworking assiduously to define those goals, taking into \n\n\n\f\nconsideration national characteristics and capacities \nand individual countries\u2019 development priorities.\n\nAfter three years of strong economic growth in \nMontenegro, the global economic and financial crisis \naffected us, too, leading to a drop in investment, banks\u2019 \ncredit activities and foreign trade. The patterns of \neconomic growth have changed, so we have adapted \nour economic policy to the new circumstances. At the \nsame time, the Government has adopted a medium-\nterm development plan modeled on the European \nUnion\u2019s Europe 2020 strategy. The three pillars that \nMontenegro will base its sustainable development on \nare smart growth, sustainable growth and inclusive \ngrowth. The national plan will make our structural and \ninstitutional reforms more consistent with development-\noriented public measures and investments. Aware of \nthe importance of that issue, we are setting up a centre \nfor sustainable development in Montenegro that will \nbecome operational in early 2014. We hope that in time \nit will take on a regional role and become part of the \nSustainable Development Solutions Network, based on \nthe outcome of the 2012 United Nations Conference on \nSustainable Development.\n\nOne issue that is inseparable from the post-2015 \ndevelopment framework is that of climate change. \nMontenegro is committed to intensifying its efforts \nto promote the adoption by 2015 of a comprehensive \nand legally binding agreement that would apply to all. \nWe call on every country, in particular the major world \neconomies, to step up their efforts related to mitigating \nthe impact of climate change and reaching a global \nclimate agreement. In that regard, we emphasize our \nfull support for the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative in \nconvening a conference on climate change in September \n2014.\n\nThe maintenance and promotion of international \npeace and security is a continuing challenge for the \nUnited Nations. We note that in some crisis areas, such \nas Mali, significant progress has been made in reducing \nviolence and instability, while the situations in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African \nRepublic, the Sudan and South Sudan still need the \ncontinued attention and efforts of the Security Council \nand other relevant actors.\n\nDue to the overall consequences for the country \nitself and for the broader region, the crisis in Syria \nregrettably still monopolizes the attention of the global \nbody politic and is at the top of the agenda of the United \nNations. We are deeply concerned about the continuing \ndeterioration of the situation in Syria and most strongly \ncondemn any form of violence, killing of civilians and \nviolation of human rights. We especially condemn the \nuse of chemical weapons confirmed by the United \nNations inspection team, which Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon has labeled a war crime. We urge that those \nresponsible for crimes in Syria and for violations of \ninternational law be brought to account. \n\nThe agreement reached between the United \nStates and the Russian Federation gives us hope for \na diplomatic solution to the crisis and an end to the \nconflict in Syria through resolute action on the part \nof the Security Council. We believe that a political \nsolution and a democratic transition are the only way \nto end a tragic conflict that has led to a humanitarian \ncrisis of incalculable proportions, affecting the whole \nregion.\n\nThe case of Syria, among others, highlights the \nimportance of preventive measures and mediation \nin preserving international peace and security. \nStrengthening the capacity of the United Nations to \nachieve an early response and suppress threats before \nthey become a source of conflict will be key to dealing \nwith similar situations in future. Montenegro supports \nthe promotion of the concept of the responsibility to \nprotect and its operationalization, with prevention as \nan integral element. We are in favour of continuing the \ndebate on the international community\u2019s responsibility \nfor taking timely and decisive action to prevent mass \nsuffering.\n\nIn the context of the situation in the Middle East, \nwe are particularly pleased by the resumption of \nPalestinian-Israeli negotiations after several stalled \nyears, and we commend the mediation efforts of the \nUnited States Secretary of State. Montenegro believes \nthat direct negotiations are the best way to reach a \ncomprehensive and sustainable settlement.\n\nWith the intention of taking on additional \nresponsibilities and contributing to the promotion \nof global peace and security and the observance of \nuniversal values, rights and freedoms as a responsible \nand proactive member of the international community, \nMontenegro is seeking a non-permanent seat on the \nSecurity Council for 2026-2027.\n\nBesides its strong support for improving the \nconception and structural development of United \nNations peacebuilding and peacekeeping capacities, \nMontenegro recognizes the importance of the rule of \n\n\n\f\nlaw and the protection of civilians, particularly women \nand children, and urges United Nations missions to \nconsistently fulfil their mandates in that area. We \ncondemn all forms of violence, especially sexual \nviolence against women and girls in conflict situations, \nand we therefore support the implementation of the \nagenda on women and peace and security and, in that \ncontext, Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and \nother relevant resolutions.\n\nThe adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty as the first \nlegally binding instrument in that area will undoubtedly \ncontribute to global efforts in the field of disarmament \nand non-proliferation. I am pleased to emphasize that \nMontenegro was a firm supporter of a comprehensive \nand strongly worded Arms Trade Treaty from the outset \nand was among the first 65 countries to sign it. We are \nconscious of how important it is that the Treaty enters \ninto force as soon as possible and will therefore make \nevery effort to ensure its speedy ratification.\n\nThe increased integration of human rights into \nevery aspect of the work of the United Nations, ensuring \nuniversal respect for human rights, and the effectiveness \nof the United Nations system in the area of human rights \nconstitute the guidelines for action for Montenegro, \nespecially through the Human Rights Council, of which \nmy country is a member. By cooperating actively with \nthe Council and its special proceedings, as well as with \nMember States, we contribute to timely and efficient \ndeliberations on issues relating to the promotion of \nhuman rights and responding adequately to cases of \nhuman rights violations. \n\nAt the national level, we are striving to strengthen \na political, social and economic environment that \nallows for the free exercise of human rights without \nany form of discrimination. We focus particularly \non strengthening the position and role of women in \nsociety and on preventing violence against them and \nother vulnerable groups, including children, disabled \npersons and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and \ntransgender community. As Chair of the Decade of \nRoma Inclusion for 2005-2010, Montenegro has also \nfocused particularly on improving the position of Roma \nin our society.\n\nMontenegro remains committed to an effective \nmultilateral system in which the United Nations plays \na central role, and we support pragmatically oriented \ninitiatives and actions for its reform. We believe that \nreforming and reorganizing the Security Council, as \nthe key actor in the maintenance of international peace, \nis essential, as are revitalizing the General Assembly \nand reforming the Economic and Social Council. In \ngeneral, such reform, particularly of the Security \nCouncil, would contribute greatly to strengthening the \nposition, relevance and authority of the Organization \nas a whole and bringing it into harmony with modern \ngeopolitical processes and challenges. \n\nMontenegro\u2019s work within the Organization is \nbased on the principle of multilateral cooperation and \nrespect for the principles and values enshrined in the \nCharter of the United Nations. We are aware of the \nimportance to our visibility and effectiveness at the \ninternational level of strong and stable neighbourly \nrelations and of strengthening cooperation in all areas.\n\nWe are successfully implementing the internal \nreforms required for the achievement of our main \nforeign policy priorities \u2014 membership in the European \nUnion and NATO. The accession negotiations with the \nEuropean Union, after the provisional closing of two \nchapters, are entering a new and more demanding \nphase. The new approach in that phase of the process \nis based on reforms in the areas of the rule of law, \nstrengthening judicial processes and the protection of \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, which are of \nparticular importance for the citizens of Montenegro.\n\nIn parallel, my country is strongly committed to \nEuro-Atlantic integration. As a country that will soon \nbecome a NATO member, we are working devotedly \non the fourth annual national programme and reform \nimplementation in order to be fully ready by the time \nour invitation for alliance membership is formalized. \nWe believe that membership will also contribute to \nreinforcing security in the Balkans, where events of the \nrecent bitter past can be attributed, in part, to a lack of \nstrong security arrangements.\n\nMontenegro is seen as a stability factor in our \nregion, as confirmed by continuing advances in \npolitical, economic, social and cultural cooperation \nwith all of its neighbours. With regional cooperation \nhigh on our agenda, Montenegro actively participates \nin regional organizations. We believe that the recently \nlaunched West Balkans 6+2 initiative, the modalities of \nwhich are the subject of intense discussion, will help \nus to focus regional activities on specific development \nprojects of common interest to participating States that \nare aimed at speeding up European integration and \nimproving the quality of life of our citizens. We believe \nthat those efforts, together with European Union \nsynergy, the South-East European Cooperation Process \n\n\n\f\nand the Regional Cooperation Council, will draw the \nStates of the region closer together and to the common \ngoal of the European Union.\n\nThe international community, led by the United \nNations, with the active participation and decisive \ncontributions of all stakeholders, must continue its \nsearch for adequate responses and channel its efforts \ntowards solving the increasingly complex issues and \nchallenges that we are facing. Each and every country, \nirrespective of size, has, without any doubt, a part to \nplay in finding such solutions, based on the mutual \ntrust and cooperation necessary to build a better world.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, it is with pleasure that I extend, \non behalf of the Government and people of the State of \nKuwait, our sincere congratulations to Mr. Ashe and \nto his country, Antigua and Barbuda, upon his election \nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\neighth session. We are certain that his vast experience \nin international affairs will enable him to conduct the \ndeliberations of this session wisely and ably, and we \nwish him success in that endeavour. We extend our \nthanks to Mr. Vuk Jeremi. for his great efforts as \nPresident at the previous session. \n\nI should also like to pay tribute to the tremendous \nand tireless efforts by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \nin leading the Organization and disseminating its lofty \nmessage and in seeking to maintain international peace \nand security, in fulfilment of the aspirations of the \nStates and peoples of the world for a better world that \nguarantees a life of dignity for all human beings.\n\nThe State of Kuwait condemns the acts of terrorism \ncommitted in a shopping centre in Nairobi on Saturday, \n\n\n\f\n21 September. We extend our sincerest condolences to \nthe people and Government of Kenya and to the families \nof the victims. We also underscore again our support \nfor Bahrain and all of the measures being undertaken \nthere to strengthen security.\n\nThe maintenance of regional and international peace \nand security occupies a position of great importance \namong the priorities of the foreign policy of the State \nof Kuwait, based on its principles and objectives, the \nCharter of the United Nations and the provisions of \ninternational law, which call for the building of bridges \nof confidence, good-neighbourly relations, mutual \nrespect and non-interference in the internal affairs of \nStates, as well as for the promotion of the concepts \nof peaceful coexistence and the pursuit of peaceful \nsettlements to conflicts and disputes.\n\nIn November 2012, the State of Kuwait celebrated \nthe fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of its \nConstitution, which was the result of a distinctive \nexperience reflecting relations between ruler and \nsubject. It evolved in a historically seamless manner \ninto a democratic mechanism involving popular \nparticipation. That process has embodied the essence \nand values of political growth based on a commitment \nto working for peace, as well as developing and \nstrengthening relations with neighbouring countries \nin accordance with the principles of mutual respect, \ncommon interests and rising above the wounds of the \npast in order to chart a better future for the region and \nthe world.\n\nIn that context, I would highlight our bilateral \nrelations with the Republic of Iraq and to commend the \nefforts of the Iraqi Government to fulfil its international \ncommitments to the State of Kuwait, in implementation \nof the relevant Security Council resolutions. Our \nbilateral relations have developed in positive and \ntangible ways through communications at the highest \nlevel between the leadership of both countries. We \nhave overcome our past differences and are looking to \nthe future to strengthen and develop future bilateral \nrelations for the welfare and interests of the peoples of \nboth countries.\n\nWe also look forward to genuine cooperation \nwith the Republic of Iraq in order to find the remains \nof missing Kuwaitis and third-country nationals and \nundertake a serious search for the national archives \nof the State of Kuwait, in implementation of Security \nCouncil resolution 2107 (2013). That resolution was \nadopted following the understanding reached to transfer \nfollow-up responsibility for these matters from the \nHigh-level Coordinator on the issue of the repatriation \nor return of all Kuwaiti and third-country nationals or \ntheir remains to the United Nations Assistance Mission \nfor Iraq. In this regard, we commend the efforts of \nthe Secretary-General and his concern to accelerate \nthe closure of these two issues, discover the fate of \nthe remaining missing persons and put an end to their \nfamilies\u2019 suffering.\n\nMore than two and a half years have passed since \nthe eruption of the crisis in Syria. This crisis is more \nthan a humanitarian disaster; it is fast approaching the \ndefinition of a catastrophe, with the increasing numbers \nof victims and missing persons, both internally and \nexternally, and the recurring scenes of bloodshed, \nviolence, destruction, oppression and violation of \nthe most basic principles and values of humankind. \nThe scale of the crisis has become an obstacle to any \npossible solution that could contain it, despite the great \nand continued efforts at the regional and international \nlevels. The Security Council has been faced with a \nhistoric and decisive responsibility: to start taking \nserious and tangible steps to ensure solutions that can \nguarantee an end to the bloodshed of the brotherly \nSyrian people, achieve their demands and restore \nsecurity and stability in their country.\n\nIn January 2013, in response to the suffering of the \nSyrian people owing to the exacerbation of the crisis \nand its destructive consequences, the State of Kuwait \nhosted an international donors conference to support \nthe humanitarian situation in Syria. This conference \nachieved the desired results, and pledges surpassed \nthe targeted amount of $1.5 billion, of which the State \nof Kuwait contributed $300 million. This amount has \nbeen disbursed in full to a number of United Nations \nbodies and agencies, which converted it into emergency \nrelief assistance to the Syrian people, inside and outside \nSyria. The State of Kuwait would like to thank all \ncountries that participated in the donors conference. \nTheir participation reflected their care and concern \nregarding the deteriorating humanitarian situation in \nSyria.\n\nWe all recognize that the maintenance of peace and \nsecurity is the key that opens the doors to a dignified \nlife, prosperity and human creativity. This is because \nfactors such as development, in all its economic, social, \nenvironmental, political and cultural aspects, cannot \n\n\n\f\ntake place when peace and security are lacking or \nebbing.\n\nTurning to the Middle East region, Palestine is still \nfacing chronic challenges that have disrupted the vision \nof a future based on development and regional and \ninternational cooperation. The political and security \nconditions in the region have also been disrupted by \nthe lack of confidence created by Israel\u2019s continued \npolicy of building illegal settlements on occupied \nPalestinian lands, its continued siege of the Gaza Strip \nand the detention of thousands of Palestinians and their \nimprisonment in subhuman conditions, in contravention \nof the most basic rules of international humanitarian \nlaw. Such practices reached their peak after Palestine \nreceived Observer State status in the Organization.\n\nIn this regard, we reiterate that only the international \ncommunity will be able to find the difficult formula for \npeace. We value in this respect the ongoing efforts of \nthe United States of America to achieve a breakthrough \nin the peace process and hope that persistent efforts and \npressure on Israel will make it accept the resolutions of \ninternational legitimacy.\n\nAt the regional level, concerning Iran\u2019s nuclear \nprogramme, the State of Kuwait supports the ongoing \nefforts to peacefully resolve this issue in a manner a \nthat will preserve the right of the Islamic Republic \nof Iran and all countries in the region to use nuclear \nenergy for peaceful purposes under the supervision and \nmonitoring of the International Atomic Energy Agency \n(IAEA). We also call upon the Islamic Republic of \nIran to cooperate fully with international efforts and \nwork on implementing the relevant Security Council \nresolutions. We also call on Iran to cooperate with the \nIAEA and implement its resolutions to find a definitive \nsolution to this crisis, which had cast it shadow on this \nregion for many years, given rise to doubts and created \nan atmosphere of instability and tension.\n\nThis year, the State of Kuwait celebrated the \nfiftieth anniversary of its membership in this enduring \nOrganization. Ever since then, and driven by its belief \nin the importance of common international action, it has \nsought to provide highly effective support to many of \nthe agencies, bodies and entities of the United Nations \nsystem. This is particularly true in view of the growth \nand increase in challenges facing the Organization at \nall levels and putting the international community, \nrepresented by the United Nations, to the test, a test of \ninternational will and global partnership in facing these \nchallenges.\n\n\n\nThe adoption of the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) represented a major shift in the ability \nof the United Nations to mobilize the global will to \neradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development, \nthus clearly expressing how ambitious the will of the \ninternational community really is and the feasibility of \nthis global partnership.\n\nHowever, major new challenges have emerged \nthat are related either to security disruptions resulting \nfrom instability and the violations of human rights \nthat accompany them, or to the steady environmental \ndeterioration that threatens our world, together with \nother serious and urgent challenges. This requires the \ninternational community to take up the inevitable task \nof rethinking our preparations for a comprehensive and \nambitious development plan. \n\nWe must complement the efforts aimed at achieving \nthe MDGs by formulating new goals and incorporating \nthem in the post-2015 development plan. This will enable \nus to take a quantum leap towards a renewed global \npartnership that will complete the process under way \non the scientific bases of the Millennium Declaration \n(resolution 55/2) and the principles and outcome of the \nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \n(resolution 66/288, annex) held in Brazil. It should help \nour peoples, to whom those goals represent the hope of \ncreating an ideal world and a better life, particularly in \nthe least developed countries or those still recovering \nfrom wars and conflicts. In this respect, we refer to \nthe importance of the international community paying \ncareful attention to supporting the foundations of \ndevelopment in order to achieve security and stability \nin Somalia and Afghanistan.\n\nWhile the State of Kuwait is considered a \ndeveloping country, it has been independent since \n1961 and given a great deal of attention to providing \nfinancial and material assistance to the developing \nand least developed countries, through many different \nmechanisms and initiatives. The Kuwait Fund for Arab \nEconomic Development is a central Kuwaiti institution \nfirmly committed to implementing its promises and \npolicies on international cooperation and assistance to \nneedy people by on the ground. Since its establishment, \nand having outgrown its regional Arab scope, the Fund \nhas expanded its activities and development assistance \nto Asian, African and Central and Latin American \ncountries.\n\n\n\f\nIn that regard, the State of Kuwait has provided \nprovisional funding of $500 million to the Republic \nof Yemen for development projects in the 2012-2014 \nprovisional programme. The contribution seeks \nto support a peaceful transition of power pursuant \nto the Gulf Cooperation Council initiative and its \nImplementation Mechanism, which are aimed at \nending the crisis in Yemen, re-establishing security \nand stability there, and rehabilitating the development \nsectors in order to fulfil the legitimate aspirations of \nthe Yemeni people to live in peace and security through \nthe consolidation of democracy and good governance.\n\nThe State of Kuwait, through its great interest in \npromoting and intensifying regional and international \nmultilateral activities by reviewing cooperation and \ncoordination measures in many important and political \nfields, has hosted many regional and international \nsummits, meetings and conferences. All haved focused \non a multiplicity of issues, challenges, hopes and \naspirations and supported initiatives aimed at creating \nbetter conditions for the peoples of the region and the \nworld.\n\nIn order to expand that approach, built on \ncoordination and a spirit of entrepreneurship, in \nNovember the State of Kuwait will host the third \nArab-African Summit under the theme \u201cPartners \nin Development and Investment\u201d. We hope that \nthis initiative will achieve results that deepen the \nfoundations of Arab-African cooperation and open \nnew horizons in the name of stability, development \nand cooperation between the people and countries of \nthese two regions. The State of Kuwait will also host \nthe thirty-fourth session of the Supreme Council of the \nCooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf \nin December, as well as the twenty-fifth Summit of \nLeague of Arab States in March 2014.\n\nIn conclusion, I reiterate the commitment of the \nState of Kuwait to the international multilateral system \nand to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations, as well as its belief in the importance \nthat all States fulfil the obligations to which they \nhave committed in international agreements and \nconferences. That will help in the search for just and \nequitable solutions to the global threats and challenges \nconfronting us in order to achieve the lofty objective of \nmaintaining international peace and security.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I would like to \ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth \nsession, as well as members of your team, and to extend \nto you my full support in your future work. \n\nPlenary meetings of the General Assembly have \nalways been an opportunity for Heads of State to gather \nand exchange their opinions about the world situation \nin order to try to find solutions for contemporary global \nproblems.\n\nMy country\u2019s strategic goal of establishing a formal \nrelationship with and membership in the European \nUnion (EU) is based upon its ambition to become part \nof the big family of democratic States and therefore \nassure the full functionality of its own institutions and \nits further development on the basis of a free market \nand the rule of law, and especially human rights. Based \non the direction and foreign policy activities of Bosnia \nand Herzegovina, our focus remains on furthering \nour relationship and institutional relationship with the \nEuropean Union, according to the Stabilization and \nAssociation Agreement and its full implementation. \nBosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s aspiration to become a \nmember of the European Union is based upon broad \npolitical census.\n\nThe fact that the process of European integration \ndemands comprehensive political, institutional and \nlegal adjustments in order to reach European standards \nin all areas is of fundamental importance to my country. \nWe are also fully aware that the active participation \nof all segments of society of Bosnia and Herzegovina \nis necessary to expedite the process of European \nintegration. I expect that expediting the remaining \nactivities and the implementation of the Sejdi.-Finci \nruling of the European Court of Human Rights will \nlead to the fulfilment of the requirements for Bosnia \nand Herzegovina\u2019s application for accession to the \nEuropean Union.\n\nI also hope for a positive development in the process \nof fulfilling the conditions for activating the NATO \nmembership action plan and further integrating Bosnia \nand Herzegovina into NATO security structures. I would \nalso like to emphasize that Bosnia and Herzegovina is \nin the final phase of negotiations for accession to the \nWorld Trade Organization.\n\nAllow me to emphasize again that Bosnia and \nHerzegovina has a very clear stance with regard to war \ncrimes. All those accused of war crimes will be held \nresponsible for the crimes of which they are accused \nbefore either international or domestic courts.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina puts great emphasis on \nregional and subregional cooperation and dialogue \namong neighbouring countries, whose cultures \nand traditions have been present in the Balkans for \ncenturies and who are currently at different stages \nof transition and democratic reform. Bosnia and \nHerzegovina is turned towards the future and to \ncooperation with neighbouring countries on the basis \nof mutual respect, as well as respect for sovereignty \nand territorial integrity. The development of bilateral \nrelations with all of our neighbouring countries and \nother countries in the region is focused on several key \nareas: Euro-Atlantic integration, advancing economic \ncooperation, strengthening regional cooperation and \nfinding constructive solutions for current issues.\n\nOur emphasis on regional cooperation is on the \ndevelopment of communications infrastructure as a \nbasis for better economic, cultural and scientific ties, as \nwell as overall regional development. The potential for \nregional economic ties is especially strong in the areas \nof industry, tourism, agriculture and energy.\n\nI would like to especially emphasize our bilateral \nrelations with the Republic of Croatia, which gained \na new dimension and dynamic with the Croatian \naccession to the EU, which was marked by eagerness \non both sides to find solutions that are in best interests \nof both our countries.\n\nI must point out that we continue to live during \none of the greatest economic and financial crises in \ncontemporary history, which is certainly the greatest \nthreat to global peace and security. We must do \neverything in our power to tackle its negative effects \nand consequences. Although the latest indicators show \nthat some developing countries are coming out of the \nrecession, that is not the case in poor and developing \ncountries, where the consequences of the crisis are very \nharsh.\n\nThe institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina have \nbeen strategically working towards achievement of \n\n\n\f\nthe Millennium Development Goals. We believe that, \ndespite the difficulties caused by the world economic \nsituation, there will be no obstacles in reaching our stated \ntargets by 2015. Bosnia and Herzegovina has finalized \nthe development strategy for Bosnia and Herzegovina \nand the social inclusion strategy for Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, while the strategy for poverty eradication \nhas already been designed and implemented. All of that \nhas been done in cooperation with the relevant United \nNations agencies in the country, whom we would like to \nthank for their close cooperation.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina is ready to contribute to \nglobal efforts to define a development framework and \nthen to implement it in order to readily face economic, \nsocial and environmental challenges. Considering \nthat the importance of the three aspects of sustainable \ndevelopment I have mentioned crosses national \nborders, Bosnia and Herzegovina believes that regional \ncooperation is crucial for the successful preparation of \nthe new post-2015 development framework.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina, as well as all the other \nWestern Balkan countries at this stage of integration, \nfollows European Union policy and views with regard to \nthe new development agenda. Bosnia and Herzegovina \nconsistently supports the position that sustainable \ndevelopment is possible only in harmony with nature. \nI am of the opinion that economic and political \ninterests must not be an obstacle to achieving global \nconsensus on a true beginning of the global fight for the \npreservation of the natural balance of planet Earth. It is \noften forgotten that climate change has a direct impact \non development, poverty and hunger, and consequently \non global peace and security. Short-term solutions will \nhave long-term consequences, and the steps we take \ntoday will be our legacy for generations to come.\n\nAll of us present here agree that the United Nations \nneeds continuous and comprehensive reform, which \nshould be conducted with great caution, assuring a \nwide consensus of Member States. United Nations \nreform should provide for efficient and coordinated \nfunctioning of all segments and bodies of the system. \n\nIt is a widely held belief that Security Council reform \nis crucial for core reform of the world Organization. \nThat reform, carried out with the consensus of the \nMember States, is necessary for reasons of efficiency \nand credibility, and it can be achieved only by taking \ninto account the contemporary geopolitical reality, \nwhich differs from that of 1945. Only a Security \nCouncil reformed in that way can have full authority \nand responsibility in addressing the most important \nissues of international peace and security. That is the \nmandate entrusted to the Council by the Charter of the \nUnited Nations.\n\nDialogue and compromise are the best way to \nensure the widest possible support, and Bosnia and \nHerzegovina supports the opinion that Security \nCouncil reform should be moved from a standstill \nas soon as possible. We also believe that a reformed \nSecurity Council should have an additional seat for a \nState from the Eastern European Group, as the number \nof countries in that group has more than doubled in the \npast two decades.\n\nIn accordance with that position, I would also like \nto emphasize that more engagement in preventative \ndiplomacy is expected from the Security Council. We \nbelieve that more activity in the area of preventive \ndiplomacy would help solve many problems and crises \nbefore they intensify, which would be a more efficient \nway for the Council to work. Encouraging dialogue \nto resolve critical issues by compromise, while acting \nagainst any kind of exclusiveness, especially in the \narea of human rights and human life, is of the utmost \nimportance. Timely and efficient conflict prevention, \nrather than reaction to a crisis that has already escalated, \nis definitely a more effective and less costly approach \nto international peace and security. \n\nWe are eager to share with others the positive and \nthe negative of our post-conflict and peacebuilding \nexperience. Bosnia and Herzegovina believes that \nevery crisis should be studied carefully, with careful \nconsideration for the roots of conflict, the culture, \nreligion and local customs and every other factor in \norder to find a just and long-term solution. There are no \nuniversal solutions for any crisis, and each one should \nbe attended to and considered separately.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina believes that it is necessary \nto take concrete steps to prevent nuclear proliferation \naround the world. In spite of visible obstacles of the \npast decade, there are new initiatives giving new \nmomentum to the disarmament and non-proliferation \nprocess. We believe that nuclear disarmament can be \nachieved by encouraging Member States parties to the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to \nrespect their obligations under the Treaty. \n\nBosnia and Herzegovina will sign the Arms Trade \nTreaty during the Treaty event.\n\n\n\f\nBosnia and Herzegovina is gravely concerned about \nthe continuing violence in Syria, which has worsened the \nhumanitarian crisis and caused unacceptable suffering \nfor the Syrian people. We call on all the parties to \ncomply with their obligations under international law \nand human rights law. \n\nResolving the crisis in the Middle East continues \nto be one of the most important priorities of the world \nOrganization. We believe that all possible steps should \nbe taken to create a positive climate in order to achieve \na just and comprehensive peace in the region. We expect \nall sides to refrain from any rash actions and to focus on \nlaunching this very important dialogue.\n\nIn order to play a constructive role in international \nrelations and to contribute to self-sustainable peace \nand stability, Bosnia and Herzegovina participates in \nthe International Security Assistance Force mission in \nAfghanistan. In support of international efforts, we also \nactively participated in the United Nations missions in \nLiberia, South Sudan and Cyprus. \n\nI would also like to emphasize that Bosnia and \nHerzegovina remains very concerned that terrorist \nattacks around the world continue to take the lives \nof innocent victims. We are committed to fighting \nterrorism and believe that results in that regard can be \nachieved only through comprehensive cooperation and \na partnership of as many Member States as possible.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina is also following the \nsituation on the African continent with great interest. \nWe expect that despite the world financial and economic \ncrisis, most developed countries will continue to \nincrease their contributions to the official development \nassistence that is essential for capacity-building in poor \nAfrican countries. Therefore, we welcome the activities \nof the United Nations through the New Partnership \nfor Africa\u2019s Development and other efforts aimed at \nputting Africa on the road to stable and sustainable \ndevelopment, especially with regard to achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals. That particularly \napplies to the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. \n\nWe also support all efforts of the African Union, \nAfrican Governments and the United Nations to improve \nthe rule of law and democracy and to strengthen civil \nsociety and its institutions, in order to improve all \naspects of society. We wish to point out that continued \nand greater financial aid to Africa is just as important \nas improving the efficiency and transparency of the use \nof aid funds for sustainable development.\n\nIn today\u2019s world, with political and social processes \nmore dynamic than ever, we face challenges quite \ndifferent from those of only a few decades ago. It is \nbecoming clear that only a strong multilateral approach \ncan produce good solutions. In its more than six decades \nof existence, the United Nations has seen many trials \nand tribulations, but it has always been, and continues \nto be, the only guide to a better future. It is still the \nonly organization capable of providing solutions to the \nglobal problems we face. \n\nIt is up to us to make it stronger and more efficient, \nfor only the United Nations \u2014 the most comprehensive \nand inclusive organization \u2014 can help bring progress \nand well-being to our planet. If we work together to \nimplement all our agreements reached in this hallowed \nplace, there is no doubt that we will live in better and \nmore just conditions than exist today. On that path, \nwe need to return to the basic values and principles \nof human rights, equality and world peace that are the \nfoundation of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, at the outset, I \nwould like to offer my most sincere felicitations on your \ndeserved election as President of the General Assembly \nand to seize the moment to express appreciation for the \nvaluable efforts of the Secretary-General.\n\nOur world today is replete with fear and hope \u2014 fear \nof war and hostile regional and global relations; fear \nof deadly confrontation between religious, ethnic and \nnational identities; fear of the institutionalization of \nviolence and extremism; fear of poverty and destructive \ndiscrimination; fear of decay and the destruction of \nlife-sustaining resources; fear of the disregard for \nhuman dignity and rights; and fear of the neglect of \nmorality. Alongside those fears, however, there are new \nhopes \u2014 the hope of the universal acceptance of \u201cyes \nto peace and no to war\u201d by the people and the elite all \nacross the globe; and the hope that dialogue will be \npreferred over conflict and moderation over extremism.\n\nThe recent election in Iran represents a clear, living \nexample of the wise choice for hope, rationality and \nmoderation by the great people of Iran. The realization \nof democracy consistent with religion and the peaceful \ntransfer of executive power showed that Iran is an anchor \nof stability in an ocean of regional instabilities. The \nfirm belief of our people and Government in enduring \npeace, stability, tranquillity, the peaceful resolution of \ndisputes and the reliance on the ballot box as the basis \nof power, public acceptance and legitimacy has indeed \nplayed a key role in creating such a safe environment.\n\nThe current critical period of transition in \ninternational relations is replete with dangers, albeit \nalso with unique opportunities. Any miscalculation of \none\u2019s own position, and of course those of others, will \ncause damage on a historic scale; a mistake by one actor \nwill have a negative impact on all others. Vulnerability \nis now a global and indivisible phenomenon.\n\nAt this sensitive juncture in the history of global \nrelations, the age of zero-sum games is over, even \nthough a few actors still tend to rely on archaic and \ndeeply ineffective ways and means of preserving their \nold superiority and domination. Militarism and the \nrecourse to violent and military means for the purposes \n\n\n\f\nof subjugating others have shown themselves to be \nfailed examples of the perpetuation of old ways in new \ncircumstances.\n\nCoercive economic and military policies and \npractices geared to the maintenance and preservation of \nold superiorities and domination have been pursued in a \nconceptual mindset that negates peace, security, human \ndignity and exalted human ideals. Ignoring differences \nbetween societies and globally imposing Western values \nas universal values represent further manifestations of \nthat conceptual mindset. Yet another reflection of the \nsame cognitive model is the persistence of the Cold \nWar mentality and the bipolar division of the world into \nthe \u201csuperior us\u201d and the \u201cinferior other\u201d. Fanning fear \nand phobia around the emergence of new actors on the \nworld scene is still another.\n\nIn such an environment, governmental and \nnon-governmental, religious, ethnic and even racial \nviolence has increased, and there is no guarantee \nthat the era of quiet among major Powers will remain \ninviolate under the pressure of such violent discourse, \npractices and actions. The catastrophic impact of \nviolent and extremist narratives should not \u2014 in fact, \nmust not \u2014 be underestimated.\n\nIn that context, the strategic violence that is \nmanifested in efforts to deprive regional players of \ntheir natural domain of action, containment policies, \nregime change from the outside and efforts to redraw \npolitical borders and frontiers, is extremely dangerous \nand provocative. The prevalent international political \ndiscourse depicts a civilized centre surrounded by \nuncivilized peripheries. In that scenario, the relation \nbetween the centre of world power and the peripheries \nis hegemonic. \n\nThe discourse that assigns centre stage to the North \nwhile relegating the South to the periphery has led to the \nestablishment of a monologue in international relations. \nThe creation of illusory identity distinctions and the \ncurrent prevalent violent forms of xenophobia are the \ninevitable outcome of such discourse. Propagandistic \nand unfounded faith-phobic, Islamophobic, Shiaphobic \nand Iranophobic discourse indeed represents a serious \nthreat to world peace and human security. That \npropagandistic discourse has assumed dangerous \nproportions through the portrayal and inculcation of \npresumed imaginary threats. One such imaginary \nthreat is the so-called Iranian threat, which has been \nemployed as an excuse to justify a long catalogue of \ncrimes and catastrophic practices over the past three \ndecades. The arming of the Saddam Hussein regime \nwith chemical weapons and support for the Taliban and \nAl-Qaida are just two examples of such catastrophes. \nLet me say in all sincerity before this world Assembly \nthat, based on irrefutable evidence, those who harp on \nthe so-called threat of Iran are either a threat against \ninternational peace and security themselves or promote \nsuch a threat. Iran poses absolutely no threat to the \nworld or to the region. In fact, in its ideals as well as in \nactual practice, my country has been a harbinger of just \npeace and comprehensive security.\n\nNowhere in the world has violence been so \ndeadly and destructive as in North Africa and West \nAsia. Military intervention in Afghanistan, Saddam \nHussein\u2019s imposed war against Iran, the occupation \nof Kuwait, military interventions against Iraq, the \nbrutal repression of the Palestinian people, the \nassassination of ordinary people and political figures \nin Iran and terrorist bombings in countries such as Iraq, \nAfghanistan and Lebanon are examples of the acts of \nviolence committed in that region in the past three \ndecades.\n\nWhat has been and continues to be practiced \nagainst the innocent people of Palestine is nothing less \nthan structural violence. Palestine is under occupation; \nthe basic rights of the Palestinians are being tragically \nviolated, and they are deprived of the right of return \nand access to their homes, birthplace and homeland. \nApartheid as a concept can hardly describe the crimes \nand the institutionalized aggression committed against \nthe innocent Palestinian people.\n\nThe human tragedy in Syria represents a painful \nexample of the catastrophic spread of violence and \nextremism in our region. From the very outset of the \ncrisis, when certain regional and international actors \nhelped to militarize the situation through the infusion \nof arms and intelligence into the country and active \nsupport for extremist groups, we emphasized that there \nwas no military solution to the Syrian crisis. The pursuit \nof expansionist strategies and objectives and attempts \nto change the regional balance through proxies cannot \nbe camouflaged behind humanitarian rhetoric. \n\nThe common objective of the international \ncommunity should be a quick end to the killing of \nthe innocent. While condemning any use of chemical \nweapons, we welcome Syria\u2019s acceptance of the \nChemical Weapons Convention and believe that access \n\n\n\f\nby extremist terrorist groups to such weapons poses \nthe greatest possible danger to the region and must be \nconsidered in any disarmament plan. Simultaneously, \nI would underline that any illegitimate and ineffective \nthreat of use, or the actual use of, force will only lead \nto the further exacerbation of violence and crisis in the \nregion.\n\nTerrorism and the killing of innocent persons \nrepresent the ultimate inhumanity of extremism and \nviolence. Terrorism is a violent scourge and knows no \nnational borders. But violence and extreme actions, \nsuch as the use of drones, against innocent people \nin the name of combating terrorism should also be \ncondemned. Here I should also like to say a word about \nthe criminal assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists. \nFor what crimes were they assassinated? The United \nNations and its Security Council should answer this \nquestion \u2014 have the perpetrators been condemned?\n\nUnjust sanctions, as a manifestation of structural \nviolence, are intrinsically inhumane and against peace. \nContrary to the claims of those who pursue and impose \nthem, it is not the States and the political elite that \nare targeted; rather, it is the common people who are \nvictimized by such sanctions. Let us not forget the \nmillions of Iraqis who, as a result of sanctions cloaked in \ninternational legal jargon, suffered and lost their lives, \nand the many more who continue to suffer throughout \ntheir lives. Those sanctions are violent, pure and \nsimple, whether called smart or otherwise, unilateral \nor multilateral. They violate inalienable human rights, \ninter alia, the right to peace, the right to development, \nthe right to access to health and education, and, above \nall, the right to life. Sanctions, beyond any and all \nrhetoric, cause belligerence, warmongering and human \nsuffering. It should be borne in mind, however, that their \nnegative impact is not limited merely to their intended \nvictims; it also affects the economy and livelihood of \nother countries and societies, including the countries \nimposing sanctions.\n\nToday violence and extremism have gone beyond \nthe physical realm and, unfortunately, have afflicted and \ntarnished the mental and spiritual dimensions of life in \nhuman societies. Violence and extremism leave no space \nfor understanding and moderation as the necessary \nfoundations of the collective life of human beings and \nmodern society. Intolerance is the predicament of our \ntime. We need to promote and reinforce tolerance in \nthe light of the religious teachings and appropriate \ncultural and political approaches. Human society \nshould be elevated from a state of mere tolerance to one \nof collective collaboration. We should not just tolerate \nothers. We should rise above mere tolerance and dare to \nwork together.\n\nPeople the world over are tired of war, violence \nand extremism. They are hoping for a change in the \nstatus quo. This is a unique opportunity for us all. The \nIslamic Republic of Iran believes that all challenges can \nbe managed successfully through a smart, judicious \nblend of hope and moderation. Warmongers are bent \non extinguishing all hope. But hope for change for the \nbetter is an innate, religious, widespread and universal \nconcept.\n\nHope is founded on the belief in the universal \nwill of the people across the globe to combat violence \nand extremism, to cherish change, to oppose imposed \nstructures, to value choice and to act in accordance with \nhuman responsibility. Hope is without a doubt one of \nthe greatest gifts bestowed upon human beings by their \nall-loving Creator. And moderation means to think and \nmove in a wise, judicious manner, conscious of time \nand space, and to align exalted ideals with a choice \nof effective strategies and policies, while remaining \ncognizant of objective realities.\n\nThe Iranian people, in a judiciously sober choice \nin the recent elections, voted for the discourse of hope, \nforesight and prudent moderation, both at home and \nabroad. In foreign policy, the combination of those \nelements means that the Islamic Republic of Iran, as \na regional power, will act responsibly with regard to \nregional and international security and is willing and \nprepared to cooperate in these fields, bilaterally as \nwell as multilaterally, with other responsible actors. \nWe defend peace based on democracy and the ballot \nbox everywhere, including in Syria, Bahrain and other \ncountries of the region, and believe that there are no \nviolent solutions to world crises. The bitter and ugly \nrealities of human society can be overcome only through \nrecourse to and reliance on human wisdom, interaction \nand moderation. Peace, democracy and the legitimate \nrights of all countries in the world, including in the \nMiddle East, cannot and will not be secured through \nmilitarism.\n\nIran seeks to resolve problems, not to create them. \nThere is no issue or dossier that cannot be resolved \nthrough reliance on hope, prudent moderation, mutual \nrespect and the rejection of violence and extremism. \nIran\u2019s nuclear dossier is a case in point. As clearly \n\n\n\f\nstated by the leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, \nacceptance of Iran\u2019s inalienable rights constitutes the \nbest and easiest way of resolving this issue. This is \nnot political rhetoric. Rather, it is based on a profound \nrecognition of the state of technology in Iran, the \nglobal political environment, the end of the era of zero-\nsum games and the imperative of seeking common \nobjectives and interests in order to reach common \nunderstanding and shared security. Put otherwise, Iran \nand other actors should pursue two common objectives \nas two mutually inseparable parts of a political solution \nfor Iran\u2019s nuclear dossier.\n\nFirst, Iran\u2019s nuclear programme \u2014 and for that \nmatter, that of all other countries \u2014 must pursue \nexclusively peaceful purposes. I declare here, openly \nand unambiguously, that, notwithstanding others\u2019 \npositions, this has been and always will be the objective \nof the Islamic Republic of Iran. Nuclear and other \nweapons of mass destruction have no place in Iran\u2019s \nsecurity and defence doctrine, and contradict our \nfundamental religious and ethical convictions. Our \nnational interests make it imperative that we remove \nany and all reasonable concerns about Iran\u2019s peaceful \nnuclear programme.\n\nThe second objective \u2014 acceptance of and respect \nfor the implementation of the right to enrichment \ninside Iran and the enjoyment of other related nuclear \nrights \u2014 provides the only path towards achieving the \nfirst objective. Nuclear knowledge in Iran has now \nbeen domesticated and nuclear technology, including \nenrichment, has already reached an industrial scale. \nIt is therefore an illusion and extremely unrealistic \nto presume that the peaceful nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear \nprogramme could be ensured by impeding the \nprogramme via illegitimate pressures.\n\nIn this context, the Islamic Republic of Iran, \ninsisting on enjoying its rights and the imperative of \ninternational respect and cooperation in this exercise, \nis prepared to engage immediately in time-bound and \nresults-oriented talks to build mutual confidence and \nensure the removal of mutual uncertainties with full \ntransparency.\n\nIran seeks constructive engagement with other \ncountries based on mutual respect and common \ninterests and, within the same framework, does not \nseek to increase tensions with the United States. I \nlistened carefully to the statement made by President \nObama today in the General Assembly. With efforts \ncommensurate with the political will of the leadership \nin the United States, and hoping that they will \nrefrain from following the short-sighted interests of \nwarmongering pressure groups, we can arrive at a \nframework to manage our differences. To this end, equal \nfooting, mutual respect and the recognized principles \nof international law should govern our interactions. Of \ncourse, we expect to hear a consistent message from \nWashington, D. C.\n\nIn recent years, a dominant message has been heard \nreiterating again and again that the military option is \non the table. Against the backdrop of this illegal and \nineffective assertion, let me say loud and clear that peace \nis within reach. So, on behalf of the Islamic Republic of \nIran, I propose, as a first step, the consideration by the \nUnited Nations of a project to be known as \u201cA World \nAgainst Violence and Extremism\u201d. Let us all ride this \nwave. I invite all States, international organizations and \ncivil institutions to undertake a new effort to guide the \nworld in this direction. We should start thinking about \na coalition for enduring peace across the entire globe \ninstead of ineffective coalitions for war in various parts \nof the world.\n\nToday, the Islamic Republic of Iran urges the \nAssembly and the entire world community to take a \nstep forward by accepting our invitation to join A World \nAgainst Violence and Extremism. We should accept and \nbe able to open up new horizons in which peace will \nprevail over war, tolerance over violence, progress over \nbloodshed, justice over discrimination, prosperity over \npoverty and freedom over despotism. As beautifully \nstated by Ferdowsi, the renowned Iranian epic poet:\n\n\u201cBe relentless in striving for the cause of good;\nBring the spring, you must; \nBanish the winter, you should.\u201d\nNotwithstanding all the difficulties and challenges \nbefore us, I am deeply optimistic about the future. I \nhave no doubt that the future will be bright, with the \nentire world solidly rejecting violence and extremism. \nPrudent moderation will ensure a bright future for \nthe world. My hope, aside from personal and national \nexperience, emanates from the belief shared by all \ndivine religions that a good and bright future awaits the \nworld. As stated in the Holy Koran:\n\n\u201cAnd certainly We wrote in the Book after \nthe reminder that (as for) the land, My righteous \nservants shall inherit it.\u201d (The Holy Koran, XXI:105)\n"

        "file_text": "Last week a heinous terrorist \nattack was perpetrated against the Republic of Kenya, \n\n\n\f\nresulting in the death and injury of dozens innocent \ncivilians as well as the destruction of property. We \ncondemn this senseless attack and express our fraternal \nsolidarity with the people of Kenya.\n\nThe theme for the sixty-eighth session is \u201cThe \npost-2015 development agenda: setting the stage\u201d. It \nechoes the words of the Preamble to the Charter of the \nUnited Nations: \u201cto promote social progress and better \nstandards of life in larger freedom\u201d. As leaders, we \nare therefore challenged to ensure that the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda promotes sustainable development \nand a secure future for current and future generations.\n\nWhen the Millennium Summit adopted the \nMillennium Development Goals in 2000, it emphasized \nthe urgency of making the world a better place for all \nhumanity. That promise gave hope to millions who live \nin abject poverty and deprivation in many parts of the \nworld. As we approach the 2015 deadline, we should ask \nourselves whether we have lived up to the commitments \nthat we made in 2000. We believe that the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda should be people-centred and \ninclusive, with a focus on the provision of health care, \neducation, food security and nutrition, energy, potable \nwater, gender equality and the empowerment of women, \nyoung people and people with disabilities.\n\nThe challenges of climate change and \nenvironmental conservation should continue to be \na focus of our attention. During the United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development in 2012, we \nmade commitments to create a new global partnership \ncharacterized by a new spirit of solidarity, cooperation \nand mutual accountability. The outcome document of the \nConference, entitled \u201cThe future we want\u201d (resolution \n66/288, annex), identified poverty eradication as the \ngreatest global challenge facing the world today and an \nindispensable requirement for sustainable development.\n\nAs I speak, the eleventh session of the Conference \nof the Parties to the United Nations Convention \nto Combat Desertification is about to conclude its \ndeliberations in our capital city, Windhoek. We \nbelieve that the outcome of the Conference will further \nstrengthen the Convention\u2019s role in mitigating the \neffects of desertification and droughts, particularly on \nthe continent of Africa.\n\nWhile developing countries have made \ncommendable advances in the areas of social and \neconomic development, many challenges remain. \nNamibia holds the view that the post-2015 development \nagenda should take into account the valid concerns \nand challenges faced by middle-income countries, \nsuch as access to grants and concessional funding for \ndevelopmental purposes. The post-2015 development \nagenda should also embrace the protection of \nfundamental human rights and freedoms, the rule of law \nand the maintenance of international peace and security. \nI wish to emphasize that sustainable development \nrequires adequate and predictable financing at the local \nand international levels.\n\nNamibia is concerned about the conflict situations \nand growing instability in many parts of the world. \nWe welcome the signing of the Peace, Security and \nCooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic \nof Congo and the Region. Namibia urges all signatories \nto the Framework to work together in good faith \ntowards its full implementation. We commend the \nefforts of the Intervention Brigade to restore peace in \nthe eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and call on \nthe international community to give its full support to \nachieving the success of that important mission. We \nalso appeal to the international community to provide \nhumanitarian assistance to the communities affected by \nthe conflict.\n\nNamibia welcomes the decision of Madagascar\u2019s \nreformed special electoral court, paving the way for \nholding presidential and parliamentary elections there \nnext month. We call on the international community to \nprovide the financial, technical and logistical support \nnecessary for those elections to be successful.\n\nOur Government continues to support the efforts \nof the African Union (AU), through the African Union \nMission in Somalia, to stabilize the situation in Somalia.\n\nThe Southern African Development Community \nand AU election observer missions have declared \nthe harmonized elections that recently took place in \nZimbabwe to be free, peaceful and credible. In that \ncontext, Namibia calls for the unconditional lifting of \nall sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe.\n\nWe welcome the holding of democratic elections in \nMali and congratulate President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita \non his election. We commend the Economic Community \nof West African States and other international partners \nfor the leading role they have played in resolving the \ncrisis in that country.\n\nI take this opportunity to reiterate our steadfast \nsolidarity with the people of Cuba, who have endured \n\n\n\f\nharsh conditions due to the illegal economic blockade \nimposed on their country. We once again call for the \nunconditional lifting of the embargo on Cuba.\n\nThe attainment of self-determination of peoples \nliving under foreign occupation is one of the principles \nthat this Organization was founded on. In that regard, \nwe reaffirm our solidarity with the people of Western \nSahara, and call for the implementation of the United \nNations settlement plan for that country. Similarly, we \ncall for the implementation of relevant United Nations \nresolutions on Palestine.\n\nNamibia condemns the use of chemical weapons \nagainst the civilian population in Syria, as confirmed \nby the United Nations inspectors. We welcome the \nagreement reached between the Russian Federation and \nthe United States of America to place Syrian chemical \nweapons under the control of the Organization for the \nProhibition of Chemical Weapons. We also support \nthe efforts of the Joint Special Envoy of the Secretary-\nGeneral and the League of Arab States to help the \nSyrian parties find a peaceful solution to the conflict \nin their country.\n\nThe process of reforming the United Nations system, \nespecially the Security Council, must be accelerated in \norder to make it representative and democratic.\n\nThis session of the General Assembly presents an \nhistoric opportunity for the international community to \ntake concrete steps to eradicate poverty and enhance \ninternational peace and security in order to create a \nworld free of want, as envisaged in the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Let us summon the necessary \npolitical will to act now.\n\nI congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session and \nassure you of the full support of my delegation.\n"

        "file_text": "I am honoured \nto deliver this statement on behalf of Prime Minister \nPeter O\u2019Neill and the people of Papua New Guinea. I \nalso wish to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as \nPresident of the General Assembly. We welcome your \noverarching theme of \u201cThe post-2015 development \nagenda: setting the stage\u201d, advocating a solid global \nfoundation for a results-oriented partnership that is \npeople-centred and inclusive in our common pursuit of \nsustainable development. Papua New Guinea pledges \nits support to you as you take on that important task. \nWe acknowledge the contributions of your predecessor \nand wish him well in his future endeavours.\n\nI take this opportunity to address the Assembly \non the state of our economy, highlight the challenges \nbefore us and put forward the policies and development \nplans of my Government.\n\nPapua New Guinea continues to be a vibrant and \nthriving democracy. However, as experienced by other \ndeveloping nations, the road has not been easy in \nterms of the political, economic and social challenges \nthat have confronted us domestically and globally. In \nthe past, our development efforts have been littered \nwith missed economic opportunities. My Government \nis therefore determined to reset the development and \nwealth-creation direction for our nation.\n\nWe have set a transformative agenda for our \ncountry and people under our long-term Papua New \nGuinea Vision 2050 policy framework and five-year \n\n\n\f\nmedium-term development plan. We are determined to \nachieve those development plans, as they continue to \nreinforce our work aimed at achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and making progress on the post-\n2015 development agenda.\n\nOur economy continues to record unprecedented \ngrowth levels, which can be attributed to a stable \nGovernment with responsible and sound monetary \nand fiscal policies. Such positive economic growth \ncomplements the Government\u2019s long-term development \npolicies aimed at stimulating the economy and \nachieving our development aspirations. Strategies to \nstrengthen economic growth include reinvesting in key \nenablers, such as infrastructure, health and education, \nso as to maximize opportunities and improve the lives \nof our citizens.\n\nMy Government is harnessing that positive \neconomic growth to address and improve our social \nindicators, including low literacy levels and high \nmaternal and infant mortality rates. We have also \nembarked on a major strengthening of law-and-order \nenforcement infrastructure. This year, 50 per cent of \nour budget has been allocated to education and basic \nhealth care, law-and-order enforcement, and critical \ninfrastructure improvement.\n\nMy Government is committed to a public-private \npartnership model as an important catalyst for national \ndevelopment. We are also committed to strengthening \nexisting programmes and networks with the private \nsector, churches, donor agencies and non-governmental \norganizations through cooperative and mutually \nbeneficial arrangements.\n\nWe are equally committed to investing in provincial \nand local-level government so as to improve service \ndelivery for the majority of our population living in \nrural areas. We firmly believe that such partnerships \nwill create an enabling environment and empower our \npeople to take ownership of their lives and be proactive \nin nation-building.\n\nMy Government has also embarked on investor-\nfriendly policies, supported by public-private \npartnerships and prudent economic management, so \nas to promote growth in key non-mining sectors. In \nthat connection, my Government is reviewing taxation \npolicies with a view to providing incentives and \nconcessions and encouraging strategic investments in \nareas that are critical to driving our economic growth. \nExporting our raw materials is not an option. We \ntherefore encourage downstream processing through \ngenuinely joint ventures and other acceptable economic \ncooperation.\n\nMy Government is committed to strengthening \ngovernance at all levels by combating corruption. We \nhave adopted the principle of zero tolerance. To that end, \nthe Government has adopted a national anti-corruption \nstrategy and established an independent task force with \npowers to investigate and prosecute. An independent \ncommission against corruption will be established to \nenhance the implementation of the United Nations \nConvention against Corruption.\n\nGiven the importance of cross-border security \nand related issues, a national security policy is in the \nfinal stages of completion. The focus of that policy is \non dealing with national security issues as contained \nin pillar 4 of the Vision 2050 policy framework. In line \nwith our national security policy, we are committed to \nrebuilding our disciplinary forces and institutions as \nwell as continuing our participation in United Nations \npeacekeeping operations.\n\nMy Government is committed to addressing some \nof my country\u2019s unflattering international human \ndevelopment indices, including those regarding \nhuman rights issues. We recognize our development \nchallenges, including gender-based violence, sorcery-\nrelated deaths, access to social services and the low \nlevel of representation of our women in the public and \nprivate sectors. In our assessment, many of those human \nrights and human development reports are exaggerated \nand insensitive, with scant attention paid to the positive \nefforts by the Government to promote and protect basic \nrights for all our citizens. Over the past six months, \nmy Government has enacted the Family Protection \nLaw and repealed the Sorcery Act of 1971, effectively \nmaking domestic and sorcery-related violence criminal \noffences.\n\nI am pleased to announce that my Government has \nratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities. The instrument of ratification has been \ndeposited with the United Nations at this session.\n\nIn recent months, there have been many reports \nabout Papua New Guinea\u2019s bilateral agreement with \nAustralia on the regional resettlement arrangement for \nasylum-seekers. Papua New Guinea, as a State party \nto the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the \nStatus of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, recognizes \nthe importance of addressing that international \n\n\n\f\nhumanitarian issue. Our two Governments are jointly \nworking on the issue and call upon the international \ncommunity to support our efforts. Furthermore, we call \nupon like-minded Member States and other stakeholders \nto assist our efforts to address the root causes of the \ndisplacement and dislocation of people, as well as to \ncombat human trafficking and people smuggling.\n\nAs an emerging economy in the Pacific region, \nPapua New Guinea will enhance its level of engagement \non issues of mutual concern, both within the region and \nglobally. In the spirit of friendship and neighbourly \nSouth-South cooperation, we are committed to sharing \nthe benefits of our natural resources development with \nour Pacific island neighbours. We have embarked on \nthat path by providing development assistance to our \nneighbours, including the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Tuvalu, \nMarshall Islands, Tonga and Samoa.\n\nThrough the Melanesian Spearhead Group, we \nare forging dynamic and strong bonds in areas that \ninclude trade and investment, education and training, \njudicial support, sporting and cultural exchanges and \nvisa arrangements to facilitate the movement of skilled \npersons. To further consolidate such very important \npartnerships at the regional level, we are collectively \nreviewing the relevance of the Pacific plan in relation \nto regional integration. Papua New Guinea is playing a \nleading role in that review exercise.\n\nPapua New Guinea supports the outcome document \nof the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment (Rio+20), entitled \u201cThe future we want\u201d \n(resolution 66/288, annex), as the basis for the post-\n2015 development agenda. That agenda addresses \nbalanced human development, including issues relating \nto eradicating extreme poverty and improving living \nstandards for humanity. We also support inclusive \neconomic growth, while preserving the environment \nfor future generations. We welcome the work of the \nHigh-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 \nDevelopment Agenda and the creation of the High-\nLevel Political Forum on Sustainable Development, \nwhich succeeded the Commission on Sustainable \nDevelopment. Both serve as a good starting point for \ndriving the agenda forward.\n\nPapua New Guinea and the Pacific small island \ndeveloping States call on the international community \nto support the inclusion of the oceans as a stand-alone \nsustainable development goal. We are now in the initial \nstages of preparing a sustainable development policy \nand strategy for our country, which is to complement \nour long-term Vision 2050 policy framework. We \nwelcome support from the international community to \nenhance that work. \n\nPapua New Guinea is pleased to note that the \nsustainable development issues of small island \ndeveloping States are a priority on the General \nAssembly agenda, further reaffirming the importance \nof the Rio+20 outcome document and the relevant \nGeneral Assembly resolutions. Your two visits this year \nto our Pacific region, Mr. President, underscore your \ncommitment to small island developing States, for which \nwe applaud you. We look forward to the strengthening \nof that important work during your presidency.\n\nAs the global community prepares for the third \nInternational Conference on Small Island Developing \nStates in September 2014 in Apia, Papua New Guinea \nreiterates the call for small island developing States to \nremain a special case for sustainable development. The \nadverse impacts of climate change continue to be of \nserious concern to the global community, but especially \nfor small island developing States. While contributing \nthe least to that threat, small island countries are not \nonly suffering the most from the serious impacts of \nclimate change but also run the risk of being submerged \nby rising sea levels.\n\nWe support the Majuro Declaration for Climate \nLeadership, recently adopted by Pacific Island Forum \nleaders. We therefore reiterate the challenge to the \ninternational community to accept its responsibilities \nand its leadership role. We also urge the international \ncommunity to renew its political commitment to \nprioritize the sustainable development issues of small \nisland developing States in the post-2015 development \nagenda. As part of our continued efforts, I am pleased \nto note that Papua New Guinea has now become a \nmember of the Governing Council of the Global Green \nGrowth Institute.\n\nPapua New Guinea agrees that the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), despite their \nshortcomings, have galvanized the international \ncommunity\u2019s development efforts to shape the post-\n2015 development agenda. We agree with the view \nexpressed in the Secretary-General\u2019s 2013 annual report \non the work of the Organization (A/68/1) that we should \nremain focused and redouble our efforts to consolidate \nthe implementation of the Millennium Development \nGoals for improved outcomes. We also welcome the \n\n\n\f\noutcomes of the recently concluded high-level special \nevents on the MDGs and on disability and development \nduring the sixty-eighth session.\n\nPapua New Guinea is unlikely to achieve most of \nthe MDGs by 2015. However, my Government remains \ncommitted to implementing the goals beyond 2015. \nWe have tailored our Millennium Development Goals \ntargets and indicators in accordance with our 2011 to \n2015 medium-term development plan and the Vision \n2050 policy framework. We are making progress in \nthe areas of universal primary education enrolment, \npoverty reduction, reduced infant and maternal \nmortality rates, combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and \nother health issues and strengthening gender equality \nand empowerment.\n\nPapua New Guinea expresses its appreciation for \nthe support it has received from United Nations agencies \nand other development partners complementing \nour efforts to accelerate the implementation of the \nMillennium Development Goals.\n\nI am pleased to report on the continued progress \nin the implementation of the Bougainville Peace \nAgreement and the successful scaling down of the \nRegional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands. \nWe thank the United Nations, regional partners and the \ninternational community for their continued assistance \nin both instances.\n\nOn international peace and security issues, Papua \nNew Guinea remains concerned about conflicts and \ntensions in various regions of the world, including in \nthe Middle East, North Africa, the Korean peninsula \nand the South China Sea. We urge all parties involved \nto defuse the situation through peaceful dialogue.\n\nWe join the international community in condemning \nthe use of chemical weapons in Syria and urge full \ncompliance with the provisions of the Chemical \nWeapons Convention. We therefore commend the \nSecurity Council for adopting resolution 2118 (2013) \nwith a view to dismantling and eradicating Syria\u2019s \nchemical-weapons programme.\n\nSince October 2011, Papua New Guinea has \nbeen contributing to United Nations peacekeeping \noperations in the Sudan and South Sudan. Earlier this \nyear, we became the 148th State Member of the United \nNations to join the Special Committee on Peacekeeping \nOperations. We are now looking at expanding and \nincreasing our troop contributions. We also pay tribute \nto the United Nations peacekeepers serving around the \nworld, often in very trying conditions, and especially \nthose who have made the ultimate sacrifice with their \nlives.\n\nWe express our concern over the lack of progress \non disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation. As a \nstrong supporter of a nuclear-free world, Papua New \nGuinea calls on the United Nations and the international \ncommunity to address that serious lack of progress. We \nalso need to revitalize United Nations disarmament \nwork so as to foster international peace and security. \nPapua New Guinea welcomes the adoption of the Arms \nTrade Treaty, which will regulate the trade and transfer \nof conventional arms, including small arms and light \nweapons.\n\nFinally, Papua New Guinea welcomes the leadership \nof the Secretary-General in reforming the United \nNations system. We encourage robust and constructive \nreforms in the context of the growing budgetary \nconstraints faced by the United Nations in recent years. \nA lean, effective and responsive United Nations is \nimperative so that it can better deliver on its mandate. \nWe also call for the Security Council to be reformed in \norder to reflect today\u2019s geopolitical realities.\n"

        "file_text": "To address \nthe General Assembly on behalf of Slovak citizens is \na great responsibility. It is a great responsibility for all \nof us who have been entrusted with such a mandate by \nour citizens. They rightly expect that this unique global \nOrganization will seek and find effective solutions \nto bring greater peace, stability and prosperity to \nhumankind.\n\nI believe that with President Ashe\u2019s experience we \nwill succeed in that task. I wish to thank his predecessor, \nMr. Vuk Jeremi., for the vigour with which he presided \nover the General Assembly at its last session. I convey \nmy deepest respect to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, \nwhose foresight and impartial service epitomize the \nvalues of the Organization.\n\nWe have been going through a period of controversial \nchanges and unperceived opportunities, as well as \nunprecedented challenges. The one thing that remains \nunchanged, however, is the power of our joint efforts \nand cooperation. Thrown off balance, the world expects \nthat we will assume responsibility for taking resolute \naction together and on behalf of humanity, not governed \nsolely by our narrow national or corporate interests. \nThe time has come to learn to respect our diversity \nand become in truth the United Nations. Achieving the \ntwo primary goals of this Organization \u2014 peace and \nprosperity for all \u2014 remains our greatest challenge and \nour primary responsibility. Effective multilateralism is \ntherefore in the national interest of us all.\n\nOur resolve and ability to respond effectively are \nbeing tested by the current Syrian crisis. The conflict \nthreatens the entire region. It is frightening not only \nbecause of the number of casualties and refugees; what \nis equally alarming is the inability of the Security \nCouncil to take any effective action. Thoughtful \nreflection on all the possible consequences of a military \nintervention in Syria makes it clear that there is only \none good solution to this conflict, the diplomatic one. \nWe must not be afraid to choose compromise solutions \nthat could serve as a basis for positive resolution of the \nproblem in the future. \n\nThe United Nations plays a key role in ensuring that \ncivilians have access to humanitarian aid, and that those \nwho commit crimes against humanity are punished and, \nabove all, in enforcing a truce and launching talks on \nstable post-conflict arrangements under the \u201cGeneva \nII\u201d initiative. Slovakia condemns the use of chemical \nweapons on principle as a crime against humanity \nand requests urgently that the perpetrators be brought \nbefore the International Criminal Court. Continued \nengagement on the part of the United Nations is \nessential, since there is no functioning alternative to \nits role.\n\nOur recent experience in addressing international \nand national crises and conflicts in various regions of the \nworld, including the so-called Arab spring, encourages \nus to be extremely cautious when considering action \nby the international community. The analysis of the \nconsequences of such action must be at least as detailed \nand elaborate as that of how to conduct a potential \nintervention.\n\nSlovakia\u2019s involvement in international crisis \nmanagement and in building and maintaining \npeace, stability and prosperity has long focused on \nAfghanistan, where the Slovak Republic has provided \nmilitary as well as civilian and humanitarian aid. We \ngreatly appreciate the work done by the United Nations \nAssistance Mission in Afghanistan and its challenging \nrole in assisting the Afghan Government with its \nsecurity, political and economic transition. \n\nIndeed, security, economic development, good \ngovernance, the protection of human rights for all and, \nlast but not least, the preparation and organization of \nfree elections, must be the founding pillars in building \na new Afghan State. The upcoming presidential \nelection will be a milestone in Afghanistan\u2019s history. \nThe key to success of all these processes, even beyond \n2014, is national reconciliation, based on the principles \nof constitutionality and respect for human rights. \nAfghanistan needs consistent, predictable and targeted \nsupport and assistance both from its neighbours and \nthe entire international community. We consider \ncooperation between the United Nations and regional \norganizations pivotal in that regard.\n\nAfrica remains a vulnerable continent with a high \nconcentration of conflicts. We believe that it will be \nable to make progress towards stability, prosperity and \ngreater cooperation in a sustainable manner, with help \nfrom the United Nations and regional organizations \nsuch as the African Union. The 50 years of the African \nUnion\u2019s existence have contributed to increased \ncooperation and development throughout the continent, \nand I believe it will stay on that path. Preventing \nconflicts and resolving their primary causes are long \nand complex processes. Africa still needs attention and \n\n\n\f\nassistance from the international community, with a \nfocus on preventive diplomacy and national ownership \nof all processes. The Slovak Republic supports more \nintensive cooperation between the United Nations and \nthe African Union, as well as closer relations between \nthe African Union and the European Union.\n\nWe continue to pay close attention to the security \nsituation in the Middle East. We are glad to see some \npositive signals among the worrying news from this \npart of the world. Slovakia welcomes and supports \nthe renewal of talks between Israel and Palestine. It \nseems, however, that talks are not enough. A number of \nbinding agreements and resolutions have been agreed \non to date in order to resolve numerous issues, but they \nhave not been sufficiently complied with. We therefore \nexpect more in the way of implementation of agreed \nsolutions. That is vital to peace, security, stability and \nfurther development in the entire region.\n\nTerrorism remains one of the most serious threats to \npeace and security. It plays a key role in many conflicts \nand most of its victims are civilians. We should keep \nour resolve to do everything to reach an agreement on \na comprehensive convention on international terrorism. \nWe will find a solution only through joint efforts under \nthe auspices of the United Nations.\n\nWe cannot have a secure, safe and stable environment \nwithout effective arms control and disarmament \nprocedures in place as the basic instrument for conflict \nprevention. The signing of the Arms Trade Treaty has \nshown that the United Nations has the potential to \nmake history and contribute substantively to greater \nsecurity in the world through its shared commitment \nto a responsible approach to arms trading. Slovakia \nbelieves that the collective efforts of the international \ncommunity can ensure that the Treaty will soon enter \ninto force, and we are prepared to do whatever is \nnecessary to promote that. With regard to eliminating \nnuclear threats and their secondary consequences for \nhealth and the environment, Slovakia actively supports \nthe entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\nBan Treaty, which we consider to be an important pillar \nof nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.\n\nI wish to particularly stress \u2014 and I repeat this \nat every meeting here at the United Nations \u2014 that \nsecurity sector reform is a key component of post-\nconflict development and effective reinforcement \nof the rule of law. In the context of the consolidation \nprocess, we therefore consider it an inseparable part of \nthe security/rule of law/development structure. If we \ncannot give people security, safety, education and jobs, \nthey will be quick to draw guns again in desperation. \nUnfortunately, experience offers proof of that. Slovakia \nclosely cooperates with the United Nations in building \nthe effective and adequate capacity essential to \nsecurity sector reform and emphasizing national and \nlocal ownership of all processes. The United Nations \nis a guarantor of an impartial system of support to its \nmembers in that area.\n\nEnduring peace requires respect for freedom, \ndemocracy, the rule of law and human rights. The \nculture of impunity has no place in today\u2019s world. \nThe role of the International Criminal Court in the \nmultilateral system is irreplaceable in that regard, as \nit focuses on preventing the perpetrators of the most \nserious crimes from going unpunished. But its decisions \nmust be unquestionable. The Slovak Republic welcomed \nthe adoption of amendments to the Rome Statute of the \nInternational Criminal Court in June 2010. Therefore, \nwe call on all United Nations Members that have not yet \ndone so to ratify the Rome Statute and its amendments.\n\nThis year, we celebrate the twentieth anniversary \nof the World Conference on Human Rights and the \nadoption of the Vienna Declaration and Programme \nof Action. Those historic documents are still relevant \nand represent a priority objective that the activities \nof the international community should pursue. They \nconfirm that the universal nature of all human rights \nand fundamental freedoms is beyond question. At the \nsame time, they emphasize the interconnection between \npeace and security, economic and social development, \nand respect for human rights.\n\nThere can be no peace without economic stability \nand prosperity. Ensuring sustainable development and \nsocial stability is beyond doubt the most effective way \nto prevent conflicts. That is an agenda in which the \nUnited Nations has enormous potential; however, it is \none of the most fragmented within the United Nations \nsystem. We appreciate that this issue is among the key \npriorities of the current session.\n\nIts relevance is also evident in a series of important \nside events that focus on meeting the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and the development agenda in \ngeneral. We particularly appreciate the initiative of \nthe General Assembly in organizing the High-level \nMeeting on Disability and Development with the aim \nof ensuring the inclusion of people with disabilities \n\n\n\f\nin the development agenda beyond 2015. There are \nsome 1 billion people with disabilities worldwide, \nmany of them living in poverty, who are still excluded \nfrom equitable access to education, health care, jobs, \nand social and legal support systems. This dialogue \nis another step forward towards the empowerment \nof people with disabilities. We want to stress the \nimportance of including this issue in the development \nagenda beyond 2015. We are also paying increased \nattention to ensuring access to energy supply, water and \nsafe food for all.\n\nSlovakia wants to actively participate in the \npreparation of the development goals beyond 2015 \nand is getting ready for a new stage in development \ncooperation. We have only recently become a \nmember of the Development Assistance Council of \nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment, reflecting our commitment to becoming \na full-fledged member of the international community \nof donor countries. Slovakia has thoroughly studied \nthe report of the High-Level Panel on the Post-\n2015 Development Agenda, which sets out a global \nframework for development cooperation goals. The \ngoals and measures must be coherent with and integrate \ndevelopment, social and environmental aspects in line \nwith the outcome of the United Nations Conference on \nSustainable Development in Rio. \n\nThe new goals must ensure effective and measurable \nresults. The crucial task will be identifying resources \nto meet the new sustainable development goals. Our \nefforts to meet the Millennium Development Goals \nhave been hindered by the ongoing lack of public funds \nand resources. The economic and financial crisis has \nhelped to reveal a number of systemic deficiencies in \nthe distribution and control of resources, in particular \npublic ones, as well as the need to draw on innovative \nresources, including private ones, in the process. \nSlovakia wants to contribute to the discussion through \nits work in the Committee of Experts on Sustainable \nDevelopment Financing.\n\nUntil recently, Slovakia was a recipient of \ndevelopment assistance. Naturally, it now wants to give \nback by supporting countries dependent on assistance \nfrom the international community. This year, we \ncelebrate the tenth anniversary of the establishment of \na national system for official development assistance. \nThe focus of the development assistance provided by \nSlovakia reflects the needs of countries that rely on such \nassistance and responds to the global challenges within \nthe international community. Slovakia has experience \nin political and economic transition and integration \ninto European and trans-Atlantic structures. Slovakia \nnow primarily shares the lessons it has learned from \nbuilding civil society and public governance reforms \nwith the countries of the Eastern Partnership and the \nWestern Balkans, as well as others, including Kenya \nand Afghanistan. Slovakia concentrates on poverty \neradication by facilitating access to health care and \neducation and by enhancing the status of women and \nyoung people in those countries.\n\nWe are going through turbulent times. The United \nNations has the potential to be a global leader in ensuring \npeace and prosperity for all. But if its effectiveness is \nnot enhanced, the Organization\u2019s relevance will be \nat risk. In order to perform all its tasks, the United \nNations must be strong, inclusive and open. Global \nlinks require strengthening existing partnerships with \nregional organizations, partners from the private sector \nand, last but not least, civil society. We understand \nthat the United Nations needs sufficient financial and \nhuman resources to effectively fulfil its mandates, but \nwe call for their more efficient use.\n\nThis year, Slovakia celebrates the twentieth \nanniversary of its sovereign existence. It was only \nnatural that the first steps of Slovakia as a sovereign \nState led to the United Nations. The principles and \nobjectives of the United Nations represent the firm \ncornerstone of Slovak foreign policy, based on the \nvalues of effective multilateralism. Over these 20 years, \nSlovakia\u2019s cooperation with the United Nations has \nstrengthened and intensified as Slovakia has grown \nand as its position as a stable democratic country and a \nreliable, proactive partner at the international level has \nbeen strengthened. Thanks to that development, in June \nI was able to host a summit of 20 Eastern and Central \nEuropean presidents in Bratislava, where we discussed \nways to address the current financial and economic \ncrisis and on good regional cooperation.\n\nSlovakia has been contributing to a wide range \nof United Nations activities through its work in the \nOrganization\u2019s main bodies and its direct involvement \nin more than 17 peacekeeping operations, as well as by \nimplementing over 400 humanitarian and development \nprojects in more than 20 countries worldwide. Having \nwon the trust of its partners, Slovakia has been elected \nto all relevant United Nations bodies, enabling it to \npromote and enforce even more effectively the values \nof the United Nations in all three main pillars of its \n\n\n\f\nwork. I can assure the General Assembly that Slovakia \nwill continue its tireless efforts to serve and assist in \nmeeting the United Nations goals as a reliable partner.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the people and Government of Nicaragua, \nComrade President Daniel Ortega Saavedra and \nComrade Rosario Murillo, I want to begin by paying \ntribute to the Commander of the revolution of our \nAmerica and the Caribbean, leader of the free men and \nwomen of the world, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez Fr\u00edas, who has left \nus a legacy of strength, hope and certainty of victory \nin defending the inalienable rights of humankind, such \nas sovereignty, justice, freedom, democracy, solidarity \nand peace.\n\nOn behalf of the people and the Government of \nreconciliation and national unity of Nicaragua, led \nby Comrade Daniel Ortega Saavedra, I congratulate \nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. We are pleased \nthat a representative of a brother country and member of \nthe Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America, \nPetrocaribe and the Community of Latin America and \nthe Caribbean States will guide us in the activities of \nthis important organ so that our efforts may contribute \nto the purposes and principles of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations, which must be implemented by the \nOrganization.\n\nThe United Nations continues to require profound \nreform that cannot be delayed any longer. The position \nof some permanent members of the Security Council on \nthe issue can no longer be an insurmountable obstacle. \nWe continue to support the proposed reinvention of the \nUnited Nations proposed by our colleague Father Miguel \n\nd\u2019Escoto Brockmann. The power of the Organization \nmust rest completely with the General Assembly.\n\nThe economic and financial situation imposed by \nglobal capitalism continues to rapidly dismantle the \nwelfare State in developed countries and seriously \naffects developing countries. Now more than ever, it \nbecomes essential to establish a new global economic \nmodel that is sustainable, based on justice, solidarity, \ncomplementarity and committed to the defence of the \nEarth and the environment.\n\nInternational democracy cannot exist without \nrespect for international law. Nicaragua continues \nto demonstrate with reliable facts its adherence to \ninternational law and its respect for the principle of \nresolving our differences through dialogue, negotiation \nand recourse to international bodies such as the \nInternational Court of Justice to settle territorial and \nother types of disputes.\n\nWe welcome the central theme selected by you, \nMr. President, for the Assembly\u2019s sixty-eighth session, \nnamely, \u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: setting \nthe stage\u201d. It is important, therefore, that we agree to \nlaunch an intergovernmental process for that new phase.\n\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean, we are \ndeepening our political, economic, social and cultural \nintegration process, all the while respecting our \ndiversity and building unity. Our Community of Latin \nAmerican and Caribbean States has been achieving a \nshared vision of social development, education, health, \nthe environment, energy and financing, among other \nsectors. It is now preparing to work collectively on \ncooperation, nuclear disarmament, fighting corruption, \nagriculture, science and technology.\n\nIn the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our \nAmerica and in Petrocaribe, Nicaragua has found a \nmodel of integration to overcome poverty, hunger and \ninequality, while strengthening the Central American \nIntegration System , the Mesoamerican Integration and \nDevelopment Project and its economic and commercial \nrelations with the international community and its \norganizations.\n\nIn this difficult context, Nicaragua continues \nto make progress. We have opted for a development \nmodel that produces results. Despite the difficulties \nand limitations, the Millennium Development Goals in \nNicaragua are being realized in a tangible manner that \ndemonstrates our Government\u2019s respect and promotion \nof the human rights of its citizens and its deep ethical \ncommitment to the common good.\n\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the \nUnited Nations has recognized our country\u2019s remarkable \nprogress to ensure the food security of our citizens and \nto reduce the prevalence of undernourishment.\n\nOur Government guarantees the right to universal \nprimary education. Major programmes are under \nway \u2014 the \u201cbattle for ninth grade\u201d, the intercultural \nbilingual education programme, the inclusive education \nprogramme and the comprehensive school nutrition \nprogramme.\n\nUN Women ranks Nicaragua among the leading \ncountries in the world with the highest percentage \nof women in the executive, legislative and judicial \nbranches. Today 42 per cent of the deputies in the \nNational Assembly are women. Women hold 54 per cent \nof positions in the executive branch, 60 per cent in the \njudicial branch and 50 per cent in municipal councils. \nWe established a Ministry of Women to promote gender \nequality and to empower women, while our laws ensure \nthat women enjoy human rights.\n\nNicaragua received the Americas Award \nof the International Training Centre for Local \nActors/Authorities (CIFAL) Atlanta and the United \nNations Institute for Training and Research for \nachieving its goals in reducing maternal mortality and \nin recognition of the national strategy called Maternal \nHomes. In 2006 the national maternal mortality rate \nwas 92.8 per 100,000 live births. In 2012 the rate was \nnearly half that, reduced to 50.9, and we continue \nfighting to reduce it further.\n\nWe continue our efforts to combat HIV/AIDS. \nPreventive measures are being disseminated and \nsupportive care is provided to patients. In 2012 Nicaragua \nreceived recognition from the Pan American Health \nOrganization for its contribution to the community \nvigilance programme against malaria. Campaigns are \nbeing developed to curb dengue fever, leptospirosis \nand influenza. We have successfully carried out the \ncampaign \u201cLive clean, live healthy, live a good life, live \nwell\u201d, which aims to clean and beautify communities, \nprovide preventive health measures against epidemics \nand pandemics as well as to maintain a harmonious and \nrespectful relationship with one another and with the \nenvironment.\n\n\n\f\nAll of those projects are made possible by the \nenormous efforts our people, who have made a social, \neconomic and political model of dialogue, alliances and \nconsensus, recognized by all. Our people\u2019s inexhaustible \ncapacity for hope and essential relationship with the \nChristian, socialist and solidarity model that we have \nbuilt together, in which all sectors of the country \nparticipate, has meant that our people continue to move \nahead while promoting peace, serenity and the full \nexercise of their rights.\n\nOur defence of peace and international security \nremains unwavering. Similarly, we continue to fight \nagainst drug trafficking and the various manifestations \nof transnational organized crime. Our retaining-wall \nstrategy produces positive results. We are committed at \nthe regional level to implementing the Central American \nSecurity Strategy. It is urgent that the international \ncommunity give more support through additional \nfinancial resources to the efforts and investment the \nCentral American countries are making against those \nscourges. Despite its limitations, Nicaragua invests \nconsiderable resources from its budget to ensure an \noptimal environment for public safety. Its successes \nare internationally recognized, and Nicaragua is seen \nas one of the safest countries in Latin America and the \nCaribbean.\n\nWe are committed to the struggles of other peoples \nfor their full independence and sovereignty. Therefore, \nwe demand once again the immediate and unconditional \ntermination of the economic, trade and financial \nembargo imposed against Cuba by the United States of \nAmerica and the immediate and unconditional release \nof the Cuban patriots imprisoned in that country. The \nUnited States must also stop its arbitrary and capricious \ninclusion of that brother country in its unilateral list of \nState sponsors of terrorism.\n\nWe reiterate our full support for the legitimate \nrights of the Argentine Republic in the sovereignty \ndispute relating to the question of the Malvinas Islands.\n\nWe recognize and welcome the progress in \nthe political process of the Bolivarian Republic of \nVenezuela and reject international campaigns aimed at \nweakening it.\n\nWe condemn, once again, the arbitrary conduct \nof the Government of the United States in preventing \nthe aircraft of our colleague, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Moros, \nPresident of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, from \nflying through Puerto Rico\u2019s airspace. We condemn \nthat act, as well as the refusal of the United States to \ngrant visas to our Venezuelan brothers so that they \ncould attend this General Assembly plenary.\n\nWe reiterate our support for the brotherly people \nof Puerto Rico in their struggle for self-determination, \nindependence and social justice. Puerto Rico is one of \nthe last colonial enclaves in our continent. Its brave \npeople deserve our full support and solidarity in order \nto take their place within the United Nations and in our \nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States, \nthereby eliminating colonial situations from the region. \nWe express our solidarity with comrade Oscar L\u00f3pez \nRivera and demand that he be freed immediately.\n\nWe express the hope that the peace process in \nColombia will come to fruition, bringing peace and \nsocial progress to the people of that country.\n\nWe support the efforts being made to achieve lasting \nsolutions to the conflicts in the Middle East and North \nAfrica. Nicaragua continues to support a negotiated \nsolution to the bloody conflict in Syria. The proposal \nof the Russian Federation to put an end to the war has \nreceived broad international support, including from \ncountries that are members of the Security Council \nwith the right of veto.\n\nWe reiterate our commitment to the cause of \nthe Palestinian people in their struggle for self-\ndetermination and their legitimate right to establish \ntheir own State. We consider the resumption of talks \nbetween Palestine and Israel to be a step in the right \ndirection. The talks must be accompanied by the \nsuspension of the construction of Israeli settlements in \nthe occupied Palestinian territories.\n\nWe reiterate our solidarity with the struggle of the \nPolisario Front and the Sahrawi people, which this year \nmarks its fortieth anniversary.\n\nWe welcome the fiftieth anniversary of the African \nUnion under the banner of pan-Africanism and the \nAfrican renaissance.\n\nFurthermore, Nicaragua continues to support the \njust aspirations of the Republic of China on Taiwan \nfor greater participation in the various bodies and \nspecialized agencies of the United Nations.\n\nMuch has been said and heard in recent days about \nthe Grand Canal of Nicaragua. With that project, \nour Government intends to take advantage of the \nunprecedented transformation in global maritime trade \n\n\n\f\nthat has taken place in the first decade of the twenty-\nfirst century. Maritime trade is expected to continue \nto grow, particularly between Asia and the Americas, \nand our project is designed to complement the Panama \nCanal expansion. We are planning a canal for peace, for \nthe development of all peoples, constructed with a sense \nof responsibility as a world heritage site \u2014 a canal open \nto international investment in a reliable and transparent \nfashion, a canal that is the fulfilment of the dreams of \nthe General of Free Men, Augusto C. Sandino, and of \nthe people of Nicaragua, for their greater progress.\n\nClimate change continues to be a grave problem. \n\u201cOur environmental, economic, political, social, and \nspiritual challenges are interconnected\u201d, states the \nEarth Charter. In that statement lies the essence of \nour vision and our duty \u2014 to save Earth\u2019s vitality and \nourselves as the human race.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to begin by \ncongratulating you, Mr. President, on your well-\ndeserved election to steer the affairs of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. As I congratulate \nyou, I would like to assure you of Tanzania\u2019s support and \ncooperation as you discharge of your responsibilities. \nI also wish to acknowledge and commend your \npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi., for his \noutstanding leadership during the sixty-seventh session. \nA great deal was achieved because of his visionary and \nwise leadership. In the same vein, I would like to pay \nglowing tribute to our the Secretary-General for the \nexcellent work he is doing for the United Nations and \nhumankind at large.\n\nMy delegation and I find the theme of this year\u2019s \nGeneral Assembly to be timely and very opportune. \nWe should start now to set the stage for the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda. Hence I find the theme, \u201cThe post-\n2015 development agenda: setting the stage\u201d, to be a \nwise choice: it affords us an opportunity to know where \nwe are with regard to the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) and to decide what needs to be done \nto complete the unfinished business and enable us to \nmake informed decisions beyond 2015.\n\nThe Millennium Development Goals framework \nis the best development framework ever produced to \naddress global and national development challenges. \nThe world has never witnessed such a coalescence of \nconcerted efforts into a unified framework. It is heart-\nwarming to note that progress towards attaining MDGs \nhas been made over the past 13 years. However, that \nprogress varies from one Goal to another, and is highly \nuneven across nations and continents.\n\nAlthough extreme poverty has been halved at \nthe global level, more than 1.2 billion people are still \ntrapped in extreme poverty, which is a saddening fact. \nAn estimated 19,000 children under the age of five \nand approximately 800 women die every day mostly \nfrom preventable and curable diseases. That is totally \nunacceptable in a world of unprecedented advances \nin science and technology, which could be leveraged \nto solve almost all the development challenges facing \nhumankind. \n\nIn a world that has enough food to feed everybody, \nnobody should go hungry or be undernourished. In \n\na world with so much wealth, there is no reason that \npoverty, hunger and deprivation should ever continue \nto inflict pain and cause misery to many people. It is \nincomprehensible, therefore, that the MDGs could not \nbe fully attained.\n\nTanzania has made significant progress in \nimplementing the MDGs. We have already achieved \nthe targets in four of the eight MDGs, well before the \ndeadline set of 2015. In MDG 2, we have achieved the \ntarget on universal primary education enrolment. On \nMDG 3, we have achieved the target of gender parity in \nboth primary and secondary school enrolment. That is \na change from the past, when there were more boys than \ngirls in schools. As a matter of fact, the trend is now \ntilting towards more girls than boys in school. We are \nyet to meet targets with regard to the ratio of females \nto males in tertiary education and in decision-making \npositions, in particular Parliament. However, it is \npossible to achieve the target for parliamentarians by \n2015 because we are now in the process of reviewing \nour Constitution.\n\nWe are on target with regard to reducing \nHIV/AIDS infections, which is the requirement of \nMDG 6. Similarly, we have attained MDG 4, on child \nmortality, which is a major achievement as compared \nto where we were in 2000. But it is depressing that we \nare not on track with regard to MDG 5, with regard to \nmaternal health. We are intensifying efforts to do better \nin order to improve the health of women in Tanzania.\n\nWith regard to MDG 7, on environmental \nsustainability, we are on target with regard to drinking \nwater for the urban population, but we are lagging \nbehind when it comes to rural water supply and access \nto improved sanitation, both in rural and urban areas.\n\nWe have not relented in our pursuit of the MDG \ntargets that we are not likely to achieve by 2015. That \nwill be the unfinished business on which we will \nprobably need to take action over and above what we are \ndoing. We are lagging far behind with regard to MDG \n1 in its four main indicators. There is not much chance \nof meeting those targets by 2015 despite the efforts we \nhave been making.\n\nHowever, we have been intensifying actions to \ntransform and modernize our agriculture. Our aim \nis to increase productivity and farmers\u2019 incomes, as \nwell as to ensure food and nutrition security for them \nand the nation. Agriculture employs 75 per cent of the \nTanzanian population, and it is in that sector where the \nmajority of poor are concentrated. Therefore, improved \nagriculture will mean fewer poor people and fewer \nhungry people. Plans are also under way to expand \nthe conditional cash-transfer programme under the \nTanzania Aocial Action Fund supported by the World \nBank. We want to increase the size of investment to \nbenefit more vulnerable people, so as to accelerate the \nimplementation of MDG 1 in the shortest possible time.\n\nGenerally, it remains my firm belief that despite \nsome failures, the MDGs have been nothing short of \na remarkable success. If developed countries provided \nfinancing as envisaged under MDG 8 and in keeping with \nthe Monterrey Consensus and their own commitments \nin different forums of the Group of Eight and Group \nof 20, we would have implemented all of the MDGs to \nthe letter and spirit. We find unrealistic any post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda that does not address the critical \nissue of ensuring adequate financing. That is also true \nwith regard to accelerating the implementation of the \nMDGs in the period remaining. We will continue to \nlook to the United Nations for guidance and leadership \nin steering both processes to a successful conclusion. \n\nThe fact that the United Nations needs reform is \na matter of little disagreement. Our collective failure \nto respond to that reality creates scepticism about \nour common resolve to strengthen the Organization, \nwhich is meant to serve all nations and peoples. The \nreform we demand is long overdue. While we welcome \ndiscussions on the reform of the Economic and Social \nCouncil, Africa will not relent in demanding reform \nof the Security Council so that the continent with \nthe largest membership in the United Nations has a \npermanent voice.\n\nRegrettably, conflicts have continued to interfere in \nour development endeavours, as they linger in different \nparts of the world \u2014 from the Sahel to the eastern part \nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo and from Syria \nto Afghanistan and other places. Conflicts have caused \nan enormous loss of innocent lives, as populations \ncontinue to endure suffering. \n\nThe recent use of chemical weapons in Syria, as \nconfirmed by United Nations inspectors, is rather \ndistressing. We condemn that flagrant and senseless \nkilling of innocent people, including children, in Syria. \nWe commend the Secretary-General and the Security \nCouncil for way they have handled the matter. I believe \nthe doors for a peaceful solution to the Syrian crisis are \nnot closed and that a military solution should be the last \nresort.\n\n\n\f\nThe United Republic of Tanzania regrets to see the \nsuffering of the people of the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo as a consequence of a conflict that has continued \nfor far too long. We hope that this time around, the \ninitiative of the Secretary-General that resulted in the \nestablishment of the Peace, Security and Cooperation \nFramework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo \nand the Region, which was signed in February, will \ndeliver lasting peace, security and development for the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and the Great Lakes \nregion as a whole. We highly commend the Secretary-\nGeneral for his vision and leadership in that regard. \nWe welcome the choice of Her Excellency Ms. Mary \nRobinson, former President of Ireland, as the Special \nEnvoy of the Secretary-General for the Great Lakes \nRegion. She will surely help advance the cause of peace \nin the region, if supported by all of us in the region \nand the international community. Tanzania commits its \nsupport in that respect.\n\nAmong the enduring problems facing the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo is the proliferation \nof armed groups with varied interests. Bolder action \nis required to uproot those negative elements. Those \ngroups should be neutralized and disarmed. It is in that \ncontext that we welcomed an expanded mandate for the \nUnited Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in \nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo as per Security \nCouncil resolution 2098 (2013), which, among other \nthings, established the Intervention Brigade. Tanzania \nagreed to contribute troops to the Brigade because we \nbelieve it will help to deter belligerence and create a \nconducive environment for a political process to take \neffect. Of course, any panacea for the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo problem will be political rather \nthan military.\n\nSince 2007, Tanzania has been a proactive \ncontributor to United Nations peacekeeping operations. \nWith more than 2,500 peacekeepers \u2014 in Lebanon, \nDarfur and the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2014 we \nare the sixth-largest contributor of military and police \npeacekeepers in Africa, and twelfth globally. We \nare partaking in that noble endeavour as a faithful \nMember of the United Nations, ready to perform the \nduty of advancing and upholding the ideals of the \nOrganization. We are satisfied that our contribution, \nalbeit modest, is having a broader impact on those who \nhave experienced the horrors of conflict. In discharging \nthat historic mission, however, our peacekeepers, and \ntherefore Tanzania, have sometimes paid the ultimate \nprice, as was the case recently with the loss of seven \nbrave soldiers in Darfur and two in the eastern part of \nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo. Those soldiers \nare our national heroes, and their sacrifice is not in \nvain. We hold them in very high regard.\n\nThe death of our peacekeepers was a grim reminder \nof the dangers facing peacekeepers around the world. It \nis disturbing that armed groups and peace spoilers are \nincreasingly attacking such servants of peace. We must \nunreservedly condemn all such attacks, as there is no \ncause or justification for such barbaric attacks. They \nconstitute a crime under international law. The Security \nCouncil, whose primary role is the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security, should be in the \nforefront in terms of condemning such barbaric acts in \ngood time.\n\nAt this juncture, I wish to reiterate our call for \nan end to the unilateral economic, commercial and \nfinancial embargo against Cuba, which has lasted for \nmore than 50 years. Our call to end that unilateral \nembargo is predicated upon not only its legality but \nalso upon humanitarian concerns, in particular the \nnegative effects it has on the quality of life of many \ninnocent Cubans. We are deeply encouraged by recent \ndevelopments, especially the removal of restrictions on \nfamily travel, cash remittances and telecommunication \nservices. We hope that spirit will culminate in a total \ncessation of the embargo in the not-too-distant future so \nthat Cubans will be relieved of the enormous economic, \nsocial and financial hardships they have endured for far \ntoo long.\n\nA solution to the dispute over the sovereignty of \nWestern Sahara is also long overdue. It is high time \nthat the United Nations took bold action to give the \nSaharawi people an opportunity to decide their fate. It \nis incomprehensible that the Security Council, which \nhas been able to handle bigger security challenges, \nincluding in similar circumstances, has not been able \nto resolve the matter for nearly 40 years now. Justice \ndelayed is justice denied. \n\nMembers will agree that the Rome Statute, which \nestablished the International Criminal Court, was a \nmajor milestone for the international criminal justice \nsystem. The Court\u2019s establishment as a mechanism for \nfighting impunity was possible only with the support \nof Africa. \n\nHowever, a decade after its entry into force, a rift \nhas grown between the Court and our continent. The \nCourt is perceived as unresponsive to what are, in our \n\n\n\f\nview, the legitimate concerns of African leaders and \nthe peoples of Africa. It continues to ignore repeated \nrequests and appeals by the African Union. It was sad \nto note that legitimate requests regarding the timing \nof the trials of President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy \nPresident William Ruto went unanswered. That attitude \nhas become a major handicap in terms of reconciling \nthe Court\u2019s secondary and complementary role in \nfighting impunity. The Court\u2019s rigidity has proved \ncounterproductive and threatens to undermine the \nsupport it enjoys in Africa. We demand a change in that \nperception.\n\nTanzania condemns in the strongest terms \npossible the cowardly attack that happened last week \nat the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, which left more than \n60 innocent people dead and hundreds more injured. \nI spoke and wrote to President Kenyatta to express \nour sadness and dismay. Yesterday, I signed the book \nof condolences at the Kenyan Mission to the United \nNations here in New York. I reaffirmed our solidarity \nwith President Kenyatta and the people of Kenya during \nthese difficult moments, as well as our solidarity in the \nfight against terrorism. \n\nThat heinous attack is a heartbreaking reminder of \nthe threat that terrorism poses to humankind. None of \nus is completely safe from terrorism, as it can happen \nanywhere, anytime and to anyone. We must therefore \nincrease our vigilance, enhance regional and global \ncooperation and scale up the fight against terrorism. \nThe challenge ahead of us can be neither underestimated \nnor understated. Success will depend upon our unity of \npurpose and determination. At this juncture, I would \nlike to commend His Excellency President Uhuru \nKenyatta for his exemplary leadership in the wake of the \nattack and his unshaken resolve and firm commitment \nto continue to support the peacebuilding efforts in \nSomalia and elsewhere. We are with the Kenyan people \nin this time of distress and grief.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress once more that \nwe are passing through a time of great opportunity \ndespite the many challenges. We must take advantage \nof the current scientific and technological innovations, \nthe current advances in information and communication \ntechnologies and the knowledge and lessons learned \nfrom the implementation of development programmes, \nincluding the MDGs, to build a world without poverty, \nhunger, disease and deprivation. \n\nWe must build a world that protects its environment \nand nature, a world without wars, conflicts or acts of \nterrorism, a world where human rights are respected, \nthe rule of law is observed, democracy reigns and \ncivil society is regarded as an integral part of the \ndevelopment endeavour. With stronger multilateralism \nand the United Nations leading the way, and with \nstrong political will on the part of national leaders and \nthe people of our nations, everything is possible. We \ncan make our world a better place for everyone to live.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I wish \nto congratulate President Ashe on his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth \nsession and express my confidence that under his able \nand wise guidance, the Assembly will successfully \naccomplish its many tasks. I would also like to pay \ntribute to the tireless efforts of last year\u2019s President, His \nExcellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi., and extend my appreciation \nfor the effectiveness with which he directed the work of \nthe Assembly at the previous session.\n\nFiji reached a pivotal moment in its history earlier \nthis month, when His Excellency the President of \nthe Republic of Fiji promulgated the nation\u2019s new \nConstitution. This Constitution introduces the first \ngenuine democracy that Fiji will enjoy since we gained \nindependence from the United Kingdom in 1970. Forty-\nthree years and three Constitutions later, we finally \nhave a Constitution that is worthy of the Fijian people. \nIt is a Constitution that meets the test of a genuine \ndemocracy, that upholds the legal and moral basis of a \ncommon and equal citizenry without denying anyone\u2019s \nindividuality or culture. \n\nThe 2013 Fijian Constitution enshrines principles \nthat are at the heart of all the world\u2019s great liberal \ndemocracies: an independent judiciary, a secular State \nand a wide range of civil, political and socioeconomic \nrights. It recognizes the indigenous peoples of Fiji and \ntheir customary practices, protects the rights of the \npredominantly indigenous landowners and those of their \ntenants, demands accountability and transparency from \nGovernment officials, builds strong and independent \ninstitutions and replaces our old weighted electoral \nsystem with one based on the principle of one person, \none vote, one value. That historic achievement is the \nculmination of a path that Fiji embarked on in 2007 \nto establish a modern and stable society that can be a \nproud and responsible part of the global community. \n\nFor years we struggled to be a nation under a system \nthat created different classes of citizens and in which \nthe votes of some Fijians counted more than others. \nHow could we be one nation when our fundamental law \nsaid that we were not one people? The very idea of a \njust and equal society, of an accountable Government \nand of loyalty to the nation State was being eroded from \nwithin. There were too many elites who thought the \nbest way to entrench their own privileges was to sow \nthe seeds of division and undermine our independent \ninstitutions. The removals of the Government in 1987 \nand 2000 were the most radical expressions of that \ndysfunction.\n\nAs a result, tens of thousands of Fijians suffered, \nand many made the decision to leave their home \nforever \u2014 to leave Fiji. As I have said before, that is \none of the most shameful episodes of our history, and \nI am determined that it must never, ever happen again. \nWe must never allow a fellow citizen to be second class \nor to be less than an equal of his neighbour. Surely, such \na basic principle as that deserves the full support of all \nnations that would never accept any less for their own \npeople.\n\nSo we have set out to make a change for the good, a \npermanent change that would set the nation on a straight \ncourse and allow Fiji to finally reach the potential \nit had when we so enthusiastically embraced our \nindependence. It has been a long journey, and we have \nfaced numerous challenges along the way. But it is with \ngreat pleasure and deep honour that I stand here today \nand say: our national compass has finally been reset. \nUnder the new Constitution, we are heading towards \nFiji\u2019s first genuinely democratic elections by September \n2014 and a much brighter future as one nation.\n\nWith every month that passes, we are building \nthe foundations of our new parliamentary democracy. \nUnlike in the past, we are building a credible and fair \nsystem that will guide that process. Four political \nparties have registered thus far under the new laws, \nwhich create transparency and accountability, and \n\n\n\f\nclose to 540,000 Fijians \u2014 out of an estimated 620,000 \neligible voters \u2014 have registered for the 2014 election.\n\nMany modern, stable democracies have gone \nthrough their own turbulent periods. Some have gone \nthrough decades of instability and bloodshed, while \nothers have had a single defining moment. Those \nevents changed the course of history. They turned \ntheir countries from bastions of elitism and oppression \ninto nations of freedom, equality and true democracy. \nThe United States has its Bunker Hill and Civil War. \nFrance has the storming of the Bastille and the French \nrevolution. Australia has the Eureka Stockade, and \nBritain has had a bloody history as it struggled to \nestablish a constitutional monarchy. We Fijians have \nalso had our share of turbulence.\n\nRegrettably and to our great disappointment, some \nof our oldest friends had no faith in us. They abandoned \nus and sought to punish us with sanctions. We sought \ntheir assistance and understanding, but they turned \ntheir backs on us. They chose to support a form of \ndemocracy, governance and justice in Fiji that they \nwould never have accepted for themselves. We hope \nthat they see now that we were true to our word. All \nnations struggle over time to overcome their unique \nchallenges, to correct historic sins and to be worthy of \nthe principles on which they were founded. We in Fiji \nare no different. Our isolation led us to seek out new \nrelationships, which have proven fruitful. Now, our \nstanding in the world has never been stronger. \n\nA key principle that has guided Fiji\u2019s political \ndevelopment and foreign policy and is soundly \ngrounded in the Charter of the United Nations is \nthat we determine our own destinies as sovereign \nStates. At the same time, we recognize the necessity \nof collaborating with all Member States of the United \nNations with the aim of supporting sustainable world \npeace, substantive justice, dignity and respect for all. It \nis that spirit of collaboration that has inspired us to go \nbeyond parochial interests and reach out to help others. \nThat spirit enjoins us to be loyal to common ideals, \ngoals, values and principles. They remain our guiding \nbeacons as we navigate our way in this millennium.\n\nThe theme set by the President to guide the general \ndebate at this sixty-eighth session, which is \u201cThe \npost-2015 development agenda: setting the stage,\u201d \nis most fitting for the juncture at which the United \nNations stands. In the midst of increasing poverty and \nunderdevelopment and during an era of unprecedented \nwealth accumulation and technological advances, the \nrift that divides the rich and the poor zones of the world \never widens. We must therefore not lose focus on one \nimperative of our time: equality among nations, big and \nsmall, is central to the relevance, credibility and even \nsurvival of this global Organization.\n\nIn that regard, we are encouraged by the progress \nmade thus far in the General Assembly towards \nexpeditiously launching the follow-up mechanisms \nagreed at the Rio+20 Conference in 2012. Throughout \nthe course of this year, the Group of 77 and China \nhas emphasized that the road map towards a post-\n2015 development agenda needs to address the \nimplementation gaps of the Millennium Development \nGoals, with poverty eradication remaining an \noverarching goal. The new development agenda must \nbe universal, applicable and relevant to all Member \nStates. Let me also stress that the new development \nagenda should be centred on economic development \nthat supports both social inclusion and environmental \nsustainability.\n\nOur common desire for a transformative global \ndevelopment agenda beyond 2015 can best be achieved \nthrough collective efforts and an enhanced global \npartnership. Such efforts must place the development \nand well-being of people at its core. If the international \ncommunity and national Governments seriously \ncommit to an agenda for meaningful transformation \nat the structural, institutional and normative levels, \nthe post-2015 development agenda has the potential of \nachieving a paradigm shift in global conditions.\n\nFiji\u2019s commitment to being a good global citizen \nis manifested through our ongoing engagement with \nthe United Nations and its associated agencies and \nsecretariats. Our decision to take on the mantle of \nchairing the Group of 77 and China for the year 2013 \nwas informed by the fact that Fiji embraces its rights \nas an equal Member of the United Nations and that we \nmust therefore also carry all the due responsibilities \nexpected of us within this great family of nations.\n\nFiji\u2019s commitment to United Nations peacekeeping \nremains unwavering. It is a source of great pride \nthat, for a nation of our size, we are able to make a \nmeaningful and significant contribution. For the past \nthree decades, we have always responded to the call \nof the United Nations to serve, including in the most \ndifficult circumstances around the world. While we \nfully recognize the risks involved, Fiji\u2019s confidence in \n\n\n\f\nits peacekeepers prompted us to provide troops to the \nGolan Heights this year to assist the United Nations in a \ntime of need. The many years of service of Fijian troops \nin the Middle East region, particularly in Lebanon, \nIraq and Sinai, are an asset that our troops take with \nthem to that mission. Fiji also sees police peacekeeping \nand contributions in the corrections and justice sector \nas important in building local State institutions that \ncan be run by local authorities once peacekeeping \nmissions end, and we are building on our many existing \ncommitments in that regard in Liberia, Darfur and \nSouth Sudan.\n\nIt is up to us in the General Assembly to ensure \nthat all support possible is given to troop- and \npolice-contributing countries serving on the ground, \nincluding through clear and appropriate policy \nguidance. For the good of the countries concerned, \nwe must not abdicate that responsibility. I urge us \nall to work together in the United Nations to provide \nsuch concrete policy guidance, particularly as we see \npeacekeeping missions evolve into multidimensional \nand complex missions that differ greatly from early \nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions.\n\nAs a Pacific island nation, Fiji reaffirms its support \nfor the efforts of small island developing States (SIDS) \nto achieve sustainable development. Not only are SIDS \nacutely vulnerable to the effects of climate change, such \nas sea-level rise, ocean acidification and the increased \nfrequency of extreme weather events, but for some of \nus the threat is to our very existence. Our response \nto the plight of those most at risk must therefore be \ncharacterized by a requisite sense of urgency.\n\nThe convening of the third International Conference \nfor Sustainable Development of SIDS in 2014 will be \ncritical to addressing, in a very specific and concrete \nmanner, the many challenges faced by SIDS. It is \nan opportunity for the international community to \nrenew its commitment to the implementation of the \ndecisions and agreements pertaining to SIDS. As \nthe international community discusses the post-2015 \ndevelopment landscape, including a successor to the \nHyogo Framework for Action, we must ensure that a \nnew model accounts for and addresses the risks we \nface. This is particularly relevant for SIDS, where \nhundreds of millions of dollars in economic losses \noccur as a result of so-called natural disasters every \nyear. Protecting development gains and investing in \ndisaster resilience is vital to sustainable development.\n\nThe United Nations efforts to eradicate colonialism \nmust forge ahead within the context of the Special \nPolitical and Decolonization Committee, of which \nFiji is a member. Through the Pacific regional body \nknown as the Melanesian Spearhead Group, Fiji works \ntogether with other members of the Fourth Committee \nto accelerate the process of decolonization.\n\nIn reforming and developing its information and \ncommunication technology (ICT) infrastructure, Fiji \nhas adopted a comprehensive approach by combining a \nnational framework for ICT development with effective \nand pragmatic policies and initiatives to deliver results \ndirectly to the Fijian people. That approach is bearing \nfruit. Fiji has achieved 95 per cebt mobile coverage, \nincluding 3G; concluded one of the region\u2019s first open \nauctions for the 4G spectrum; and is implementing a \nnumber of innovative initiatives to increase affordable \naccess and improve services, including in the most \nremote parts of our country.\n\nThe International Telecommunication Union, in its \nannual review of more than 150 countries\u2019 delivery of \nICT infrastructure and services to their populations, \ngave special recognition to Fiji as a developing country. \nFiji tied for the third largest improvement of any \ncountry and is ranked fourth globally in percentage \nterms, having improved by 14 per cent.\n\nAs the first country to ratify the United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea, Fiji has kept its \noceanic obligations at the core of its foreign policy. \nWhile some disconnect exists between what is \ncontained in international instruments and what is or \nis not implemented, we need a commitment to clear \nsteps to turn words into actions in order to facilitate the \nsustainable management of ocean resources and make \nequitable the share of benefits from their utilization.\n\nFiji hosted the inaugural Pacific Islands \nDevelopment Forum (PIDF) last month. Its formation \nmakes the PIDF the only South-South organization in \nthe Pacific region that provides for a multi-stakeholder \nplatform where Governments, the private sector and \ncivil society can discuss what we Pacific Islanders need \nto do to achieve sustainable development.\n\nWe look forward to a productive sixty-eighth \nsession of the General Assembly. Let me reiterate our \nfull support and cooperation with President Ashe and \nall members with a view to advancing the objectives \nof the United Nations and the aspirations of the global \ncommunity.\n"

        "file_text": "I am once again privileged \nto address the General Assembly on behalf of my \ncountry, Belize.\n\nIt is with great delight that I congratulate you, \nSir, on your election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. You are a \ntestament to all the peoples of the Caribbean and the \nworld of the height to which each of us can aspire \nwhen industry and character are fused into one. Rest \nassured, Mr. President, of the unqualified support of \nBelize throughout your term in office. I also take this \nopportunity to thank your predecessor for his service as \nPresident of the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.\n\nIt is in the quest for the attainment of the two ideals \nof peaceful conflict resolution and the enhancement of \nthe lives of all peoples that leaders of Member States \nmake this annual pilgrimage in September to address \nthe General Assembly. Belize commends the United \nNations and its visionary leadership over the years for \nits unflinching efforts in discharging the core functions \nof the Organization.\n\nThe promulgation of the Millennium Development \nGoals, in 2000, resulted in all countries working together, \nfor the first time in human history, to address and \nrectify the gaps in their development agenda to reduce \npoverty. It was a signal event and a major breakthrough \nfor the United Nations development agenda. It gave \nhope for the provision of huge amounts of desperately \nand genuinely needed aid, the transfer of technology \nand other development assistance from affluent nations, \nfinancial institutions and philanthropists to nations \nmired in poverty. That was undoubtedly good news. It \nwas reminiscent of the Marshall Plan, which rescued \nGermany and Japan from abject ruin after the Second \nWorld War and catapulted them to heights of affluence \nthey had never experienced before.\n\nBy the end of the 1990s, most countries were in \ndire straits. According to former Secretary-General \nKofi Annan, more than 60 per cent of the world \nsubsisted on $2 or less per day, while more than \n1 billion people were living on less than $1 per day. \nIlliteracy was nearly at 1 billion people. Eight hundred \nmillion people were chronically hungry \u2014 one in seven \npeople on Earth \u2014 including 200 million children. And \n1.3 billion people lacked even the most basic health-\n\n\n\f\ncare, sanitation and education services. Today, 13 years \nlater, as the Millennium Development Goals are being \nimplemented, the scorecard reveals that, while a small \nminority of countries are showing commendable \nsuccess in attaining the Millennium Development \nGoals, the vast majority of nations are still mired in \npoverty, with scant or no signs of development.\n\nWe note with disappointment that rich countries \nhave not even been able to bring themselves to honour \ntheir commitment to contribute 0.7 per cent of their \ngross domestic product as official domestic assistance \nto poor countries. The resources being provided by \ninternational and other financial institutions and \nby private donors fall far short of what is needed by \npoor countries to attain those laudable, and indeed \nbasic, Goals. It is evident that, for some inexplicable \nreason, developed countries have abandoned Goal \n8 \u2014 developing a global partnership for development. In \nthe absence of the cooperation of developed countries, \nthe attainment of the Millennium Development Goals \nby poor countries will remain an illusion.\n\nPoor countries possess neither the requisite \nleadership cadres, the financial, human and technical \nresources, the infrastructure, the necessary levels of \ninvestment and trade nor the institutions to bring about \nlevels of development that are capable of generating \nthe wealth needed to underwrite the expenses \nassociated with the attainment and, most important, \nthe sustainment of the Millennium Development Goals. \nPerhaps even worse, far too many countries have no \nrealistic prospects for achieving such capacity within \nthe foreseeable future. Despite that, Belize remains \ncommitted to the attainment of the Goals, which we are \npursuing assiduously.\n\nGiven our experience with the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, it is, in our view, eminently fitting \nthat you, Mr. President, should have kept the spotlight on \nthe post-2015 development agenda for the sixty-eighth \nsession of the General Assembly. In that connection, \nthe theme \u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: \nsetting the stage\u201d is very apt indeed. The Millennium \nDevelopment Goals must remain a work in progress. The \npost-2015 development agenda must be informed by our \nexperiences with the Millennium Development Goals. \nIn that regard, a careful analysis must be undertaken to \nascertain why our rich development partners have failed \nto live up to their obligations under the partnership to \nprovide the promised development aid and expertise to \npoor development partners. And new mechanisms must \nbe devised to ensure that the post-2015 development \nagenda does not suffer a similar fate.\n\nAs we embark upon setting the stage for the post-\n2015 development agenda, Belize has recognized and \nidentified four underpinning points: that the post-\n2015 agenda must be global; that it should integrate \nthe outcomes of major summits into a cohesive \naction-oriented agenda that can be implemented, \nbuilding upon successes and improving lessons \nlearned; that the necessary resources must be sourced \nand committed to underwrite the new partnership for \ndevelopment; and that it must be guided by our core \nvalues of conflict prevention and poverty eradication.\n\nBelize endorses the intergovernmental processes \nfor the elaboration of the post-2015 development \nagenda. Our domestic priorities, which complement the \nglobal agenda, are contained in the document Horizon \n2030, which articulates our development framework. \nSector-specific documents emanating from Horizon \n2030 inform our national development agenda in areas \nsuch as security, energy, gender, education and health.\n\nTopping the list of our domestic priorities at this \ntime is the resolution of the Guatemalan claim, which \nposes an existential threat to our nation and requires \nurgent resolution if the peoples of our two countries \nand our region are to continue to enjoy the peaceful \ncoexistence that has characterized our relationship thus \nfar. When I addressed the Assembly last September \n(see A/67/PV.20), I was pleased to report that our \ntwo States had agreed to submit to the citizens of our \nrespective countries, in a simultaneous referendum to \nbe held on 6 October 2013, six days from today, the \nquestion of whether it was the will of our respective \nconstituencies that the Guatemalan claim be submitted \nto the International Court of Justice for a final \nresolution. Regretfully, however, last April, Guatemala \ngave official notice to both Belize and the Organization \nof American States that the Guatemalan Government \nhad decided not to proceed with the referendum and \nwas proposing that it be postponed sine die. Not \nunexpectedly, that decision was not well received in \nBelize.\n\nThe Guatemalan claim is a constant source of \nanxiety for our citizens as well as for investors in our \ncountry. Furthermore, both our territorial and maritime \nborder regions have been suffering from depredations \nand environmental degradation as a consequence of the \nwanton and sustained illegal activities of Guatemalan \n\n\n\f\ncampesinos, fishermen and criminal elements engaged \nin narco-trafficking, human trafficking, smuggling, \nillegal panning for gold, the extraction of xat\u00e9 and other \nexotic plants and animals, the illegal felling of timber \nand the pillaging of our ancient Mayan ruins. The \nfelling of timber in our rainforests is contributing to \nthe denuding of our mountains, which results in violent \nflooding in the rainy season and the transfer of topsoil, \nsand and silt into the sea. Those soils are then ultimately \ndeposited on our pristine barrier reef, choking and \ndestroying its fragile ecosystems and compromising \nthe health of the entire reef and the marine ecological \nsystem that thrives there.\n\nAdditionally, the increasing trespassing by \nGuatemalans into our country has given rise to more \nfrequent violent encounters between Guatemalans \nand members of the Belize Defence Force, resulting \nin fatalities in some instances. Those incidents put a \nheavy strain on the relations between our country and \nGuatemala and the peace of our region as a whole.\n\nWhile Belize appreciates that the activities of \nthe Guatemalans in our border regions are the direct \nresult of poverty and failed development in their \nown country, we are concerned by the fact that such \nactivities create the conditions for conflict. There are \nsome 65 Guatemalan villages along the 141-mile-long \nBelize-Guatemala border. The villagers there are \nlargely indigent and unemployed. Absent higher \nemployment and increased security patrols on both \nsides of the border, the incursions of Guatemalans will \nnot, in our view, abate, but will only get worse.\n\nBelize is resolved to do everything in its power \nto protect its citizens and territorial integrity, but our \nefforts alone will not be sufficient to put an end to the \nforays of Guatemalans into our country. Input from \nthe international community will be vital in assisting \nwith the development of income-generating enterprises \nin the border regions to ameliorate the poverty there, \nwhich is what compels Guatemalans to trespass in \nthose regions.\n\nBorder conflicts are dangerous by nature. In his \nmemoir, Interventions: A Life in War and Peace, former \nSecretary-General Kofi Annan wrote:\n\n\u201c[Conflicts] suck in their neighbours, send \nthousands of refugees spilling into other countries, \ncreate havens for armed groups and terrorists, \nand they cause the spread of criminal networks \nand cross-border lawlessness, including piracy. In \nshort, conflicts ... are inherent generators of global \ninsecurity, the causes of which need to be addressed \nby wealthy and poor States alike.\u201d\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank the \nOrganization of American States and the group of \nfriends who support the efforts of Belize and Guatemala \nto resolve the Guatemalan claim peaceably and, in the \ninterim, to ensure that peace is maintained between our \ntwo countries.\n\nClimate change is another existential threat, \nlooming not only over Belize but over all nations of \nthe world, large and small. In our view, it is urgent \nthat the international community arrive at consensus \nas to the imminence and magnitude of the threat \nposed to humankind by climate change, as well as \non the way forward in dealing successfully with that \nperilous phenomenon. That is another threat that can \nbe successfully dealt with only by the United Nations. \nCombating the threat will necessitate huge expenditures, \nthe deployment of cutting-edge technology and, most \nlikely, the cessation of the use of fossil fuels.\n\nDeveloping countries such as Belize will need both \ntechnical and financial assistance from the international \ncommunity and international financial institutions to \nadapt to the changes being brought about by climate \nchange and to mitigate the deleterious effects thereof.\n\nBelize has established a national climate \n-change committee to coordinate our Government\u2019s \ninterventions in all areas relating to climate change. We \nare also establishing a new climate-change policy and \nstrategy that provides for the scaling up of mitigation \nand adaptation efforts at all levels. We applaud the \nSecretary-General for his decision to convene a high-\nlevel meeting on climate change in the near future.\n\nThe security of its citizens is a paramount obligation \nof every Government. The Belize Government takes \nthat responsibility seriously. However, the threats to \nthe security of our citizens are so numerous in today\u2019s \nglobalized world that no single country has the capacity \nto tackle the issue on its own. Consequently, Belize works \nactively with our multilateral and bilateral partners in \nfunding the necessary resources, technical assistance \nand training in our quest to secure our citizenry. We \nare party to the Central American Security Strategy, \nwhich is dedicated to combating the activities of \nnational, regional and transnational criminals. We also \ncollaborate closely with security and law enforcement \n\n\n\f\nauthorities in our region, including Canada, the United \nKingdom, the United States and Mexico.\n\nWe are very pleased with the adoption, earlier this \nyear, of the Arms Trade Treaty and we will, in due \ncourse, ratify it. We have also enacted a whole raft of \nlegislation to strengthen our crime-fighting capabilities.\n\nThe Belize Government invests as much as 26 per \ncent of its annual budgeted expenditure on the education \nsector. We believe that education is one of the quickest \nways to lift our people out of poverty. Also, one half of \nour population is below the age of 25 and approximately \n37 per cent is below the age of 18. They will all need \nworld-class education and skills training if they are \nto be able to compete successfully in global markets. \nAt this time, Belize is not able to provide education \nand training at that level locally and cooperates with \nits international partners for the provision, in large \nmeasure, of such education.\n\nNon-communicable diseases and disabilities \nare impacting the countries in the Caribbean region \nvery negatively. In our own country, the incidence of \ncancers, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, chronic lung diseases, \nhypertension and strokes is reaching epidemic \nproportions. Empirical data reveal that in low- \nand middle-income countries, non-communicable \n-isease-related impairments account for 65.5 per cent \nof persons living with disabilities. It is therefore urgent \nthat the United Nations work to address the afflictions \nthat are blighting the lives of untold numbers of our \ncitizens.\n\nAt the most recent meeting of the Heads of \nGovernment of the Caribbean Community, a historic \ndecision was taken that the Community should pursue \nall the necessary steps to recover reparations for the \ndescendants of the victims of the transatlantic slave \ntrade from the nations that participated in and benefited \nfrom that trade. Belize urges the United Nations to lend \nits support to that initiative, which seeks to address, at \nleast in part, the unspeakable evil perpetrated by the \nEuropean nations that participated in the trade.\n\nEarlier this year, Belize successfully rescheduled \nits debt obligations with its commercial bondholders, \nan exercise that enabled us to avoid the spectre \nof sovereign default. Despite that restructuring, \nhowever, Belize\u2019s capacity to finance its development \nprogrammes is still challenged, and it continues to \nrely on cooperation with its bilateral and multilateral \npartners to achieve its development goals. In that \nregard, Belize would like to express its gratitude to \nthe United Nations and its related agencies, including \nthe United Nations Development Programme, the \nUnited Nations Population Fund, UNICEF, UNESCO, \nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \nNations, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime \nand the Pan American Health Organization, which \nwork tirelessly to support the implementation of our \nnational development objectives. We also wish to thank \nthe many nations that are currently partnering with us \nin development.\n\nBelize would like to enlist the support of the \nUnited Nations in helping to persuade the international \nfinancial organizations that per capita gross domestic \nproduct is not in itself an accurate measure of a nation\u2019s \nwealth or stage of development, particularly in the case \nof heavily indebted middle-income countries like ours. \nSuch a method of assessment would disqualify those \ncountries, including my own, from eligibility for badly \nneeded concessionary financing, and that eventuality \ncould well lead to reversals of their hard-won gains.\n\nThe Government of Belize is committed to a rights-\nbased approach to the development of our country and \npeople. To that end, we have embraced the international \nhuman rights regime and are making our best efforts to \nenable inclusive growth. In that regard, we are pleased \nto inform the Assembly that the Government of Belize \nhas, in consultation with its stakeholder partners at \nthe national level, submitted the report for its second \nuniversal periodic review for consideration by the \nHuman Rights Council at its seventeenth session, in \nOctober.\n\nI would like to inform the Assembly that we, too, \ncondemn the cowardly terrorist act that took place \nrecently in Kenya.\n\nEarlier I referred to my country\u2019s position on the \npost-2015 development agenda \u2014 that the agenda \nmust be inclusive if we are to achieve meaningful \ndevelopment. We need to ensure that all our countries \nare allowed to participate in a meaningful manner, \nand that includes the people of the Republic of China \non Taiwan. We cannot deny the significant advances \nthey have been able to make in such a short time, or \ntheir contributions in support of global goals and \ncommitments, especially in the area of development \ncooperation. Their experience can teach us about \nadvancing our own development.\n\n\n\f\nEvery year the Assembly votes to lift the economic \nembargo on Cuba. We continue to support that call.\n\nBelize also continues to call for an urgent and \npeaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nThe situation in the Middle East troubles us. As \nresponsible citizens of the world, we condemn the \nuse of chemical weapons and welcome the framework \nagreement \u2014 led by Russia and the United States of \nAmerica and supported by the Security Council \u2014 that \nwe hope will lead to the removal of all chemical and \nbiological weapons from Syria. We also call on other \nnations to abide by the Convention on the Prohibition \nof the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use \nof Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction.\n\nAs we approach the end of an era and look towards \nthe post-2015 development process, our Government, \npolicymakers, planners and all levels of society will \nbe challenged to focus on what we want and what we \ncan achieve together. We must commit to a process \nof ensuring that we adopt goals and objectives that \nreflect global priorities and are adapted to our national \ncontexts. Our agenda must be reflective of the world\u2019s \nmost pressing problems, which include, but are not \nlimited to, environmental sustainability, inequality, \ngrowth with equity and social inclusion.\n\nWe are confident that under your guidance, \nMr. President, that process will be an inclusive, \naccessible and transparent one.\n"

        "file_text": "At the very outset, allow \nme to congratulate Mr. Ashe on his well-deserved \nelection to the office of the President of the General \nAssembly. I assure him of my delegation\u2019s full support \nand cooperation during his tenure of office. I also \nwish to commend his predecessor for the exemplary \nleadership he demonstrated during the previous session. \n\nFrom the humble beginnings of a fledging \norganization more than six decades ago to a massive \nexpansion in membership today, the United Nations \nhas undoubtedly stood the test of time. Its worth as an \nindispensable entity in shaping the world of our time is \na matter of common cause. Some of the great strides the \nUnited Nations has made span the peaceful settlement \nof disputes, restoring calm in many countries through \npeacekeeping, raising awareness of human rights and \neradicating diseases. Nevertheless, much still needs to \nbe done.\n\nMuch of the world remains mired in poverty and \ndisease, while peace, security and stability continue to \nbe fragile. Economic development continues to be the \ngreatest challenge in our history. As we ushered in a new \nmillennium 13 years ago, we adopted the Millennium \nDeclaration and the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) in order to focus the world\u2019s attention on ending \nextreme poverty in all its forms. The 2015 deadline for \nthe achievement of the MDGs is fast approaching, yet it \nis clear that not much progress has been made in many \ncountries in achieving the Goals. Alive to that fact, \nthe United Nations is engaged in various processes in \npreparation for the post-2015 development era. It is in \nthis context that we welcome the theme for this session, \n\u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage\u201d. \n\nOne of the key outcomes of the United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) was \nthat we launched a process to develop a set of sustainable \ndevelopment goals (SDGs), which would build upon the \nMDGs and converge with the post-2015 development \nagenda. We note the progress that has been made in that \nregard and hope that the letter and spirit of the Rio+20 \noutcome document, \u201cThe future we want\u201d (resolution \n66/288, annex), will be upheld. It is our hope that we \nwill develop SDGs that are simple to implement, while \nalso paying attention to the reality that no one size fits \nall.\n\nThe post-2015 development agenda must be an \nintegral framework that will build upon the successes \nand failures of the MDGs. We need to reflect on the \nexperiences and lessons learned in implementing the \nMDGs, the results achieved and opportunities missed. \nIt is time for this body to come together and exercise its \ncollective responsibility to finalize this one shared goal \nof articulating and shaping a development agenda that \nis inclusive and people-centred. A new development \nagenda, premised upon the sovereign equality of all \nStates while recognizing their interdependence and \nmutually reinforcing roles, should be our goal. To \nachieve that, a renewed spirit of solidarity, cooperation \nand mutual accountability must underpin our efforts.\n\nIt is equally important, in our view, to pay special \nattention to the perils of climate change for our physical \nworld, as well as its destruction of ecosystems, all of \nwhich result in land degradation and contribute to the \ndecline of agricultural productivity. Agriculture is the \nmainstay of our small economies. In order to address \nthat challenge, agriculture and food security have to \nbe given the necessary prominence in the envisaged \ndevelopment agenda.\n\nSimilarly, sustainable mountain development \nshould be our ideal. To a country such as Lesotho, with \nover 60 per cent of its land area covered by mountains, \nsustainable mountain development is imperative for the \npeople to survive. Mountains are valuable water sources \nwith rich biodiversity. As such, international support \nfor conservation programmes and the protection of \n\n\n\f\nmountain ecosystems should be at the forefront of our \nplans.\n\nThe state of peace and security in the world is \ngradually getting worse. The possession of nuclear \nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction \nremains the principal threat to the survival of \nhumankind. The widespread sectarian strife in the \nMiddle East and elsewhere and xenophobia are some \nof the great challenges to global peace. Sadly, discord \nremains among Member States on how to overcome \nthose problems.\n\nOf particular concern to my delegation is the \nsituation in Syria, which poses a serious and growing \nthreat to international peace and security. Scores of \ncivilians continue to be the principal victims. Women, \nchildren and the elderly are bearing the brunt of the \nconflict. The use of chemical weapons in Syria is not \nonly abhorrent, but also a crime against humanity. We \ncondemn it in the strongest terms, as it threatens to \nundermine the norm against the use of chemical weapons \nuniversally embraced by the international community. \nWe welcome the partial report of the United Nations \nchemical weapons inspectors investigating the use of \nthose weapons in Syria, and hope that the culprits will \nface the might of international law and justice.\n\nThe crisis in Syria has the potential to engulf the \nwhole Middle East region, with global ramifications. \nWe call on the international community to find a quick \nand lasting solution to the conflict. Whether in Syria or \nanywhere else, perpetrators of crimes against humanity \nmust be held legally accountable for their actions.\n\nHistory has revealed that human societies can \nenjoy peaceful, orderly progress only if the rule of \nlaw obtains. The conviction that peace and justice \nare inextricably intertwined has always underpinned \nthe efforts of the United Nations in the area of the \nmaintenance of international peace and security. \nIndeed, the International Criminal Court (ICC), created \nin 1998, is a beacon that speaks to that truism. We must \nuse institutions, such as the ICC and other international \nlegal tribunals, as a reflection of the international \ncommunity\u2019s increasing rejection of impunity and \nevidence that there is a rising tide in favour of the \nrule of law. At the same time, we need to ensure that \ninstitutions, such as the ICC, are adequately insulated \nagainst politicization. Selective prosecutions must be \navoided.\n\nA decade has passed since the initiation of \nthe notion of the responsibility to protect. Yet, the \noperationalization of that concept has not become a \nreality. The fact that crimes of mass atrocity continue \nto be committed around the world is a stark reminder \nthat the time for a collective approach to protecting \npopulations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic \ncleansing and crimes against humanity is now. Most \nmass atrocities often do not occur spontaneously, but \nrather as part of a planned process. Over the years, we \nhave learned the important lesson that the Organization \ncannot stand on the sidelines when challenged to take \npreventive action. In so doing, we should guard against \nthe misuse and abuse of the norm of the responsibility \nto protect by infringing on the national sovereignty or \naltering the legal obligation of Member States to refrain \nfrom the use of force except in conformity with the \nCharter of the United Nations.\n\nFrom the Horn of Africa and across the Sahel \nregion to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the \nAfrican continent is facing a rise in lawlessness and \nconflicts. As we celebrate the jubilee of the formation \nof our continental organization, the Organization of \nAfrican Unity, we are resolved, as leaders of Africa, \nthat Africa must open a new chapter going forward and \nextricate itself from the conflicts that have so soiled its \nreputation and compromised its development. We are \ndetermined to build a safe, secure and peaceful Africa \nfrom here forward.\n\nWith the presence of extremist groups and \nterrorist entities in the Middle East and elsewhere, \nterrorism continues to pose a serious threat to world \npeace, security and development. The ugly face of \nthat scourge has once again resurfaced in Kenya. We \ncondemn the barbaric killings of innocent people in the \nWestgate mall in Nairobi, committed by Al-Shabaab. \nOur thoughts and prayers are with the families that \nhave lost their loved ones. We all know that solutions \nto these problems cannot be through military means \nalone. We have to invest more in creating a holistic and \nintegrated approach that targets, among other things, the \nimprovement of economic development, the promotion \nof the rule of law, the protection of human rights and \nfundamental freedoms, and good governance.\n\nIn the face of the numerous global challenges \nexisting in the world today, promoting more effective \nglobal governance should be at the forefront of the \ninternational agenda. We, the membership of the United \nNations, should strive for an international Organization \n\n\n\f\nwith improved efficiency and effectiveness. In our \nefforts to reform the United Nations, emphasis needs to \nbe placed on enhancing, inter alia, its accountability and \nthat of all its organs and bodies and the programmes of \nMember States, irrespective of their size and influence.\n\nIt would be remiss of me not to express solidarity \nwith the people of Cuba for having endured sanctions for \nso many years. We also want to express our unwavering \nsolidarity with the people of Western Sahara, who have \nlanguished under the yoke of colonialism for far too \nlong. In the same vein, we express our unwavering \nsupport for the people of Palestine. As a small country \nthat was surrounded by apartheid South Africa for \nalmost a century, we understand the pain that others \nwho still languish under that kind of situation feel. \nThose situations are a challenge that this body can \neasily remove from our agenda simply by doing what is \nright. In true brotherly solidarity, we appeal to this body \nto remove those final vestiges of colonial oppression.\n\nIn conclusion, I need not emphasize that our \npeoples do not necessarily look at this Organization as a \nmirror reflecting a divided and troubled world. Rather, \nthey yearn for progress and solutions to the problems \nbesieging their world. They want ideas, leadership and \nconcrete hope for the future. Our actions and decisions \nshould embody themes of peace and development that \nlook far beyond the immediacy of the moment. The \nchallenges that confront us today must be, more than \never before, addressed with the candour and decision \nthat the present global economic and political situation \ndictates to us all.\n"

        "file_text": "With an end to the global crisis \nfinally within reach, it is imperative to make growth \nand development our first priority today. In the past \n10 years, remarkable progress on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) has been made. But we \nhave to work harder. We need to empower individuals \nand communities and increase the capacity of economic \nand social systems to adapt to the rapid changes of our \ncomplex world. \n\nWith regard to the post-2015 development agenda, \nwe should address the root causes of the ills afflicting \nour world rather than limit ourselves to the side effects. \nSustainable development, in line with the outcomes \nof the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment, is the best possible antidote. In that \nconviction, Italy co-facilitated the establishment of the \nHigh-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, \nwith universal membership. We are also in favour of \nreinforcing the Economic and Social Council and of \na partial reform of the United Nations Environment \nProgramme.\n\nThe promotion of sustainable development goes \nhand in hand with the spread of democratic principles. \nWe are in favour of the convergence of the sustainable \ndevelopment goals and the MDGs after 2015. But \ndevelopment cannot be simply reduced to economic \ngrowth and statistics. We must go beyond gross \ndomestic product and pay adequate attention to the \nmore comprehensive notion of \u201cquality of life\u201d. \n\nSpecial attention should be paid to the role of \nwomen\u2019s rights and gender equality. Although women \n\n\n\f\ncultivate more than half the food grown in the world, they \nrepresent two thirds of the people who live in poverty \nand suffer from hunger. More female participation in \nthe global economy means more equality and growth.\n\nAs the Secretary-General\u2019s report on the work of \nthe Organization (A/68/1) notes, in the past 13 years \ngains have been made in the fight against poverty, \nbut despite these tangible improvements one in eight \npersons worldwide still suffers from malnutrition. Food \nsecurity should be a priority area of action. It combines \nthe need to act locally and globally. It incorporates \nsome of today\u2019s most crucial issues: a sustainable \nrelationship between consumption and production, \nenergy efficiency, and more.\n\nItaly is making a specific contribution to the issue \nof food security through Expo 2015 in Milan. The theme \nis \u201cFeeding the planet: energy for life\u201d. More than 130 \ncountries have so far agreed to participate. Italy will \nuse Expo Milan as an opportunity to exchange best \npractices on global sustainability in the area of food \nsecurity and nutrition. We intend to promote new \npartnerships between the private and public sectors. As \nI underlined to the heads of the United Nations agencies \nbased in Rome at a recent meeting, Italy feels that the \ntime has come to launch a new global initiative on \nfood. The United Nations participation in Expo 2015 \nis consequently of great importance. An integrated \napproach to development also involves a focus on its \nsocial dimensions.\n\nThe projected rise of the world population highlights \none of the most serious problems today. I am referring \nto global unemployment, particularly among young \npeople. This phenomenon affects every part of the world, \nincluding Europe and my country. We want to combine \nthe measures taken at the national and European levels \nto launch our war against unemployment.\n\nItaly deems it important to focus on small and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs), a true driver for \nemployment. Such enterprises are well placed to create \njobs for young people and contribute to social stability. \nIn Europe, 85 per cent of new jobs in the private sector \nare created by SMEs. In the employment sector, great \nattention must also be given to people with disabilities.\n\nHundreds of millions of people around the world \nbecome immigrants in a phenomenon that affects \nboth developed nations and countries of origin. Italy\u2019s \ngeographic location makes it a port of entry for thousands \nof immigrants. At the national level, we respect the \nfundamental human rights of immigrants and prosecute \ncriminals who engage in human trafficking. At the \nsame time, we have fostered international cooperation \nwith the countries of origin and of transit.\n\nOn this crucial subject, I wish to quote Pope Francis, \nwho decided to visit the small island of Lampedusa \nthis summer. He brought a message of support for the \nthousands of immigrants who arrive there from Africa \nevery year. We should all fight what he called the \n\u201cglobalization of indifference\u201d and feel the suffering of \nmigrants as our own.\n\nRecognizing that more needs to be done at the \nnational and international levels, we look forward \nto the second summit of the High-level Dialogue on \nInternational Migration and Development, to be held in \nNew York this October.\n\nAchieving sustainable development requires \nstability, security and peace. Since the outbreak of \nthe conflict in Syria, the Italian Government has \nunderlined the importance of preserving the role of the \nUnited Nations as the ultimate guardian of peace. At the \nsame time, we strongly condemn what has taken place \nin Syria with regard to chemical weapons. We cannot \nbe indifferent to blatant violations of fundamental \ninternational rights.\n\nItaly invites all members of the Security Council \nand other relevant international stakeholders to spare \nno effort in the search for political solutions. That is \nwhy the Italian Government welcomed the Geneva \nframework for the elimination of Syrian chemical \nweapons. We strongly support the work undertaken \nin the Security Council aimed at inducing Syria to \nparticipate in the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\nWe cannot accept the continuous deterioration of \nthe humanitarian situation in Syria and in neighbouring \ncountries. Once again, we invite all the parties \ninvolved in the conflict to fully respect international \nhumanitarian law. There must be effective protection \nfor humanitarian assistance.\n\nItaly has intensified humanitarian assistance, \nparticularly for refugees. Italy confirms its pledge \nof $30 million for 2013 and intends to provide even \nmore support to expand the reach of humanitarian \nassistance. At the Group of 20 Summit held in Saint \nPetersburg, we announced our intention to implement \nnew humanitarian and emergency initiatives, for an \nadditional $50 million. On Friday, upon my return to \nRome, I will enact that measure.\n\n\n\f\nWe will continue to keep Somalia high on our \nagenda. As I confirmed to President Hassan Sheikh \nMohamud a few days ago in Rome, Italy is willing to \nhelp the Somali authorities in their efforts to lay the \nfoundations of an effective and united federal State.\nTogether with Ethiopia, Italy has convened a ministerial \nmeeting of the Intergovernmental Authority on \nDevelopment Partners Forum tomorrow, 26 September, \nhere in New York, to discuss Somalia.\n\nAs the top contributor to Libya, Italy is supporting \nthe country in its stabilization and democratic transition, \nand we remain fully committed to cooperation with the \nUnited Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL). \nBefore the end of the year, Italy will host the second \ninternational conference on Libya in Rome, which we \nare preparing together with the Libyan authorities, \nUNSMIL and other partners.\n\nItaly reiterates its strong commitment to the \nstabilization of Mali and the Sahel region. At the \nnational level, we are currently funding training for \nborder police in Mali and the Niger. We welcome the \nholding of the next high-level meeting on the Sahel. \nThe strategy presented by the Special Envoy of the \nSecretary-General, Romano Prodi, is a good example \nof increasing efforts and resources.\n\nItaly is the seventh-largest contributor to the general \nbudget of the United Nations. Since 2006, despite \nfinancial constraints, we have been the top contributor \nof United Nations peacekeepers among Western \ncountries. We are demonstrating our commitment \nto peace and stability through our participation in \n10 different United Nations peacekeeping missions \nworldwide, from the Mediterranean and the Middle \nEast to Africa and Afghanistan.\n\nItaly is engaged in international initiatives \nrelated to peace and security, such as the Arms Trade \nTreaty, which we have already ratified. Other relevant \ninitiatives include the United Nations Global Counter-\nTerrorism Strategy and the United Nations Convention \nagainst Transnational Organized Crime.\n\nItaly believes that respect for human rights is \nfundamental to peaceful coexistence among nations. \nOur foreign policy will continue to focus on social \nand humanitarian affairs and the protection of human \nrights. Wherever human rights are at risk, global peace \nand security are also at risk.\n\nItaly will continue its efforts to better defend those \nmost vulnerable to violence and discrimination. Our \nactions and our thoughts must focus on the categories \nmost at risk: women, children, religious and ethnic \nminorities, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender \npersons, human rights defenders and humanitarian \nworkers.\n\nThe recent atrocities in Pakistan once again \nillustrate the importance of the issue of religious \ntolerance. The General Assembly should never stop \nacting to counter religious hatred and fundamentalism.\n\nAt the same time, Italy will continue to support \nthe campaign for a worldwide moratorium on the death \npenalty.\n\nIn the second half of 2014, Italy will assume the \npresidency of the European Union (EU). We want the \nEU to be more open to the world. That means more \nEuropean foreign, or rather global, policy. It also means \nmore trade exchanges with the rest of the world. In that \nconnection, we will host the next summit of the Asia-\nEurope Meeting, in Milan in October 2014.\n\nI am convinced that a well-governed Europe \ncan act as a global player. A good example is the EU \nenlargement policy, which succeeded in bringing \nstability to the Balkans in a very short time. It is high \ntime for the EU to rise again to assume a leading role \non the world stage. We in Europe must act now for more \nunity and for more effective governance.\n\nOn the theme of adapting to a changing world, allow \nme to conclude by referring to reform of the Security \nCouncil. As a leading member of the Uniting for \nConsensus group, Italy strongly believes that Security \nCouncil reform is absolutely necessary. The adoption of \nany such reform, however, will require the consensus of \na large majority of the membership. We need to update \nthe Security Council to today\u2019s world, increasing its \naccountability, transparency and effectiveness. To \nbridge the gap between the different models of reform, \nall Member States should be ready to engage in the next \nround of negotiations with a higher degree of flexibility \nand openness to compromise.\n\nWe have many challenges ahead. Italy will \ncontribute to addressing those challenges as an active \nmember of the international community within a \nframework of reinforced global governance. We make \nthat commitment before the General Assembly, and \nwe make that commitment before the international \ncommunity.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of \nthe President of the Republic of Angola, His Excellency \nMr. Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, whom I have the honour to \nrepresent before the Assembly, allow me to congratulate \nAmbassador John William Ashe on his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth \nsession and to assure him of my country\u2019s support in \nthe fulfilment of that important and noble mission. \nI would also like to express our gratitude to His \nExcellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi. for the effective manner \nin which he conducted the work of the previous session, \nand we salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \ncontinued dedication to the cause of our Organization.\n\nThis session of the General Assembly is taking \nplace in a complex international climate, one where the \nintervention of the international community is needed \nto provide lasting solutions to conflicts that constitute \nserious threats to international peace and security. \nThe prevalence of armed conflicts and their impact \non populations, terrorism, organized crime and drug \ntrafficking, maritime piracy, environmental crimes \nand looting of resources, as well as extreme poverty, \ndeprivation and hunger are issues that require priority \nattention from our Organization. Angola reiterates \nthe importance of the role of the United Nations as a \ndriving force behind global efforts to maintain peace, \nstability and economic and social development, and \nit is therefore important to strengthen its capacity for \nconflict prevention and crisis management.\n\nMy country will continue to contribute actively \nin peacekeeping efforts, assuming responsibilities \nat the international level, in particular with regard to \nAfrica, as well as in the regional framework and the \neconomic and political groups it is a part of, including \nthe Southern African Development Community, the \nEconomic Community of Central African States, the \nCommunity of Portuguese-speaking Countries, the \nInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region \nand the Gulf of Guinea Commission.\n\nIn that context, the Peace, Security and Cooperation \nFramework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo \nand the Region, signed in February in Addis Ababa, is \nboth the most appropriate mechanism for the peaceful \nresolution of the conflict in the eastern Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo and the best guarantee for \nregional stability and for safeguarding the peace, \nsecurity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. We reiterate our \ncall to the signatories to respect their commitments, and \nwe condemn the threats that negative forces continue to \npose to civilian populations, particularly in the city of \nGoma and its surrounding area.\n\nIn the context of global efforts to maintain \ninternational peace and security, we reiterate the \nimportance of revitalizing the United Nations system, \nparticularly through reform of the Security Council, \nwhich should adapt to the realities of today\u2019s world by \nincreasing the number of its permanent members so as \nto fairly represent every region.\n\nWe express our deep concern about the escalation \nof violence in Egypt and add our voice to the call to the \ntransitional authorities to act with moderation. We urge \nthe African Union and the international community to \ncontinue to work towards a solution to the crisis in that \ncountry.\n\nThe conflict in Syria poses a risk to international \npeace and security, and the violence is seriously \nworsening the humanitarian situation in the region. \nWe call on the international community to act urgently \nin order to arrive at a peaceful solution to the conflict \nthrough the mediation of the United Nations and the \nArab League, and we urge respect for the human rights \nof civilians.\n\nThe Israeli-Palestine conflict is one of the oldest on \nour planet and one that still confounds the international \ncommunity. Angola supports the mediation efforts \nundertaken by United States Secretary of State John \nKerry, and hopes for the resumption of dialogue and \nthe conclusion of an agreement between Palestine and \nIsrael that can convert the deadlock into lasting peace \nand the establishment of an independent Palestinian \nState within the 1967 borders, living side by side with \nthe State of Israel in security.\n\nWe note with concern the poor progress being \nmade in resolving the question of Western Sahara, \nand we urge the parties to continue negotiations under \nthe auspices of the United Nations, so that the people \nof Western Sahara can exercise their right to self-\ndetermination.\n\nAngola welcomes the normalization of the legal \nand constitutional framework of various African \ncountries that, after tumultuous periods of instability, \n\n\n\f\nhave successfully held free and fair elections and are \nnow making strides towards building democratic \nStates, establishing the rule of law and promoting \neconomic and social development. In that connection, \nwe welcome the democratic election of President \nIbrahim Keita in Mali and express our solidarity with \nthe process of reconciliation and reconstruction of the \ncountry. We also congratulate those countries that have \nshown positive developments and that despite unstable \nsituations are working to implement agreements aimed \nat resolving crises and normalizing their constitutional \nframeworks. They include Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, \nSomalia, the Sudan and South Sudan. We call for the \nentire international community to support the efforts \nthose countries are making to achieve peace and \nstability.\n\nSix years after the onset of the international \nfinancial crisis, with its grave repercussions for the \nworld economy, many countries are experiencing serious \ndifficulties in financing programmes for economic \ngrowth and mobilizing resources for development \naimed at improving living conditions and meeting the \nMillennium Development Goals. That situation is even \nmore problematic for developing countries, particularly \nin Africa, where armed conflict and poverty frequently \ncoincide.\n\nIn that context, the Angolan Government believes \nthat it is essential that we consider \u201cThe post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage\u201d, the theme of \nthis session of the General Assembly, in the hope that \nit will contribute effectively to the economic and social \ndevelopment of developing countries. The Angolan \nGovernment is of the view that during this session the \nAssembly should consider holding regional meetings \nbased on the report of the High-level Panel on the Post-\n2015 Development Agenda, A New Global Partnership: \nEradicate Poverty and Transform Economies through \nSustainable Development, in which various leaders \ncould define their positions on the post-2015 agenda \nfrom a regional perspective, and which could be \nfollowed by another meeting at the global level. In that \nregard, the Government of Angola reiterates its support \nfor initiatives aimed at liberalizing international trade \nso as to promote fair and balanced competition, and \nwe hope that the ninth World Trade Organization \nMinisterial Conference, scheduled to take place in Bali \nin December, will lead to the best results.\n\nEnvironmental challenges persist. By renewing the \ncommitments to sustainable development contained \nin Agenda 21, the United Nations Conference on \nSustainable Development provided a sound basis \nfor policy-making at the national and international \nlevels and for ensuring the social, economic and \nenvironmental welfare of our peoples. To that end, we \nreiterate that it is essential to take appropriate measures \nto strengthen international support for actions in support \nof sustainable development, as well as to increase \nthe financial resources of the United Nations budget \nthrough contributions so as to enable the Organization \nto fulfil its mandate efficiently and make sustainable \ndevelopment a reality.\n\nOn another topic, the embargo against Cuba violates \nthe rules of international law and has for decades been \na major impediment to the development of that country \nand to the improvement of the living conditions of the \nCuban people. Angola reiterates its position of principle \nthat, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the \nUnited Nations, the embargo should be brought to an \nend.\n\nAngola reiterates its belief in mutual respect \nand mutual benefit, good neighbourliness and the \nstrengthening of regional economic integration. Angola \nwill continue to respect all international commitments \nand treaties to which it is a party. We respect and \nimplement the principles of the Charter of the United \nNations and the Constitutional Act of the African Union, \nand we establish relations based on the principles of \nself-determination, the peaceful settlement of disputes \nand respect for human rights.\n\nCurrently, Angola is experiencing a period of \nconsolidation in its democratic institutions and the \nrule of law. There has also been a dynamic process \nof reconstruction and development marked by the \nconsolidation of macroeconomic stability through the \nimplementation of a national policy and strategy for the \npromotion of economic diversification contained in our \neconomic and social development plan for the period \n2013-2017.\n\nBy agreeing to join the programme of countries \neligible to graduate from the least developed country \ncategory, Angola reaffirms its priority to implement a \nprogramme of diversification of its domestic production \naimed at achieving balanced growth in various sectors, \nexpanding employment opportunities and decreasing \nits dependence on imports of consumer products and its \nhigh dependence on oil sector exports.\n\n\n\f\nDespite progress made in the past decade and the \nfact that the Angolan economy is on the right path, much \nremains to be done in order to fulfil the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Aware of that challenge, the \nGovernment continues to develop programmes aimed \nat reducing social inequality, while pursuing the fight \nagainst hunger and poverty as two crucial elements \nfor building a prosperous society and attaining social \njustice. Furthermore, rehabilitating and upgrading the \nmain productive and social infrastructure, including \nthe reconstruction of roads and railways, electricity and \nwater supply and distribution systems, and sanitation \nand telecommunication networks, continue to be a \nchallenge for the Government in its quest to improve \nthe well-being of the population and attain sustainable \ndevelopment in Angola.\n\nI would like to conclude by referring to an issue \nof particular importance for the Government of my \ncountry. The Republic of Angola is a candidate for \nnon-permanent-member status in the Security Council, \nwith elections to be held at the sixty-ninth session of \nthe General Assembly. We hope we can count on the \nsupport of all the States that make up the Assembly.\n\nI will finish by expressing my country\u2019s \nunconditional support for the initiatives of the United \nNations aimed at building a better world for all, based \non justice and freedom, free from all threats that \nendanger international peace and security.\n"

        "file_text": "I bring warm greetings from the \npeople of Kiribati, on whose behalf I am privileged to \nonce again address this Assembly.\n\nI would like to take the opportunity to echo \nthe sentiments conveyed by previous speakers in \ncongratulating Ambassador John W. Ashe on assuming \nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\neighth session. We are indeed very proud to have \na brother from the small island developing States \npresiding over this session. I am confident that under \nhis able stewardship of the Assembly will continue its \nwork towards improving security and quality of life \nfor all members of our global community, in particular \nthe most vulnerable. Let me also take this opportunity \nto express my appreciation for the leadership of his \npredecessor, Mr Vuk Jeremi..\n\nI also commend the untiring commitment and work \nof Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has been an \nable navigator on this journey, steering the United \nNations through the diverse and complex realities and \nthe myriad challenges facing our peoples and nations. \nOn behalf of the people of my country and our region, \nI wish to reiterate our deep gratitude for his personal \ncommitment to the issue of climate change and the \nplight of the most vulnerable. Our people still remember \nwith fondness the Secretary-General\u2019s visit to Kiribati \nin 2011, which was particularly significant in that it was \nthe first visit to our country and region by the head of \nthe United Nations. I am also heartened and humbled \nto hear that his visit brought home to him the stark \nrealities of the challenges facing our people, living as \nwe are on the front line of climate change.\n\nAs we gather again in New York for this session, \nthe problems are perhaps greater today than they were a \nyear ago. Security challenges posed by climate change, \nconflicts, terrorism, transnational organized crime \nand other threats continue to undermine our efforts to \nachieve sustainable development, peace and security \nfor our global community. In the past few weeks, we \nhave seen heartbreaking events unfold here in the \nUnited States, in Syria, in Pakistan, in Kenya and in \nother parts of the world, giving ample evidence of the \ngrowing security threats to our peoples from within our \nown societies. We commiserate and join in prayer with \nthe families of all those affected by those barbaric and \nterrorist acts.\n\nThe ongoing work of the United Nations, and the \nwork awaiting us at this session, reflect these challenges, \nand the President has appropriately selected the theme \n\u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage\u201d \nfor our discussions this week. Kiribati welcomes the \ntheme. We believe that it provides an opportunity for \nus to reflect on what we have done and achieved as \nindividuals, as leaders of our countries, and together as \na global body entrusted with making the world a more \npeaceful, secure and better place for everyone. We must \ncontinue to ask ourselves if what we are doing is in the \nbest interests of all our people, or of just a select few. \nWe must examine our efforts as leaders of this global \nfamily and ask ourselves if we are doing the right thing \nfor our children and their children, whose future rests \nin our hands and depends on our decisions.\n\nThis is the eighth time I have had the honour to \naddress this Assembly in my ten years as President, \nand on each occasion I have sought to convey the same \nmessage. On each occasion, I have spoken of the real \nand existential threat to my nation posed by climate \nchange and sea-level rise, and I have called for urgent \naction to ensure the long-term survival of countries like \nmine. Last year (see A/67/PV.11), I said that I would \ncontinue to speak of the peril confronting my country \nfor as long as I have breath in my body. \n\nWell, I am still breathing and the peril remains. \nIt is a critical issue for the survival of our people and \nindeed for all of humankind. Many of us here today \nare parents, and even grandparents. I myself have 10 \ngrandchildren. Surely the world that we want to leave \nto our grandchildren should be better than the one we \ninherited. But we are not on course to achieve that. \nIn fact, we are disastrously off course. The scientists \ntell us \u2014 as I am sure they will again reaffirm in their \nnext assessment report \u2014 that calamity awaits, and not \njust for those of us on low-lying islands. What we are \nexperiencing now on these low-lying atoll islands is an \nearly warning of what will happen further down the \nline. No one will be spared. \n\nWe cannot continue to abuse our planet in the \nsame old way. To shape the future we want for our \nchildren and grandchildren, we need leadership, we \nneed commitment, we need action \u2014 now. When we \nall return home to our children and grandchildren, \nwe must be able to look them in the eye and tell them \nwith confidence that we have done all that is humanly \npossible to combat the devastating consequences of \nclimate change.\n\nWe are grateful to the General Assembly for \nacknowledging that climate change is a matter that \n\n\n\f\nwarrants the attention of the Security Council. I applaud \nthe commitment of our Secretary-General to that \nspecific security threat and particularly welcome his \nrecent announcement to convene a high-level climate \nsummit at approximately this time next year. It will be \nthe most significant such event since the Copenhagen \nClimate Change Conference in 2009.\n\nBut the Secretary-General cannot mobilize the \nremedy needed on his own. He will need the support of \nall nations to ensure that the action necessary to address \nclimate change is taken. We must step up our national \nand collective efforts to mitigate global greenhouse gas \nemissions. We must urge major greenhouse gas emitters \nto do their part. We must also call with urgency on our \ndevelopment partners to assist in our efforts to deal \nwith the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise \nnow being experienced in our countries, and in our \nefforts to prepare our people for an uncertain future.\n\nThe delivery of international adaptation finance \nand resources is taking much too long. We cannot \ncontinue to stand on the sidelines and wait for others \nto deliver. In Kiribati, we are taking charge of our \nsituation and moving forward with our mitigation and \nadaptation strategies. We have finalized a national \nadaptation framework and are now working directly \nwith our partners on it. Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan \nand the World Bank are working with us to implement \nour national adaptation priorities.\n\nWhile we are taking adaptation measures to ensure \nthat Kiribati remains habitable for as long as possible, \nprudence demands that we prepare for the future of \nour people. We are looking to improve the skills of our \npeople to a level where they are able to exercise the \noption of migrating, to be able to migrate with dignity.\n\nWhen it comes to the Millennium Development \nGoals, our situation has not changed much since I last \nspoke before this body. We are on track on some of the \nGoals, but we continue to be off track on most. This, I \nbelieve, should not come as a surprise, as most of the \nlimited resources we have continue to be diverted from \nequally pressing priorities to fighting the onslaught \nof the rising seas and storm surges and their impact \non our water supplies, homes, livelihoods and public \ninfrastructure. This is a costly exercise, one we cannot \nafford but that is necessary. We will continue to rely on \nthe support and goodwill of our partners and members \nof our global family in that regard.\n\nAs we prepare for the Third International Conference \non Small Island Developing States, to be held in Samoa \nin 2014, the special needs of the most vulnerable low-\nlying small States, like Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, \nMaldives and Tuvalu, must be highlighted, for how \ncan we meaningfully discuss sustainable development \ngoals when a disproportionate amount of our time and \nscarce resources are focused on ensuring the survival \nof our people?\n\nFor us, the ocean is a double-edged sword. Sea-level \nrise threatens the very survival of our people. But the \nocean is also an integral part of our lives and provides \ndaily subsistence for our people. It can and should be a \nticket to freedom from dependency on others. We are a \nnation of water. We own substantial fishery resources. \nThe annual total catch in our waters is valued at some \n$400 million. Yet as owners, we receive only 8 per cent \nof that sum. Where is the equity, where is the justice \nin this? \n\nWe believe that this must change. Our objective must \nbe to maximize the returns from those resources, and \nwe have started in that direction with the establishment \nof our first fish-processing plant through a public-\nprivate partnership. We invite our partners to join us \nin that endeavour. I am convinced that, given the right \nsupport, we can achieve sustainable development by \nutilizing the available resources of our vast exclusive \neconomic zone. Through this approach, we can reduce \nour reliance on external assistance. I believe that if we \nare provided with the support we now need to develop \nour capacity to harvest and process our own resources, \nwe will also be better able to build our climate-change \nresilience.\n\nThe ocean is the next frontier in the pursuit of \nsustainable development. While we have failed to \nprotect our land and atmosphere from our human \ndemands, we must make sure that the ocean does not \nmeet with the same fate.\n\nIn June last year, we met in Rio de Janeiro to \nreview our progress 20 years on from the 1992 Earth \nSummit. Unfortunately, our track record in delivering \non our undertakings has not been good. In fact, in many \nrespects, our environment is worse off today than it \nwas 21 years ago.We renewed our commitment in Rio \nto achieving the future we want, but we need to move \nbeyond commitments and to act. The future we want \nwill require this Organization to restructure and realign \nitself to reflect the realities of our time: a time in which \n\n\n\f\nnew and emerging security threats, such as climate \nchange, climate variability, sea-level rise and ocean \nacidification, are challenging the international system \nof governance; a time in which the future survival of \nsome nations is seriously in question; a time when all \nthose countries with the ability to do so must contribute \nto the prevention of this calamity or be forever judged \nby history.\n\nBusiness as usual can no longer be considered an \noption. Let us not limit ourselves to working within the \nboundaries of our comfort zones. Let us be inclusive \nrather than exclusive. We must listen to civil society, \nour youth and women\u2019s groups and allow those with \nthe ability to make a contribution to join in the global \ndialogue and action to address these major challenges.\n\nIn that regard, we welcome the continued resolve \nof the Secretary-General and the President of the \nGeneral Assembly to accelerate action on the reform of \nour Organization, to ensure the highest level of global \ncollaboration, accountability and decisive action, and \nto inspire a greater sense of urgency on issues of critical \nconcern to our global community.\n\nWe also welcome the inclusion of Taiwan in the \ninternational processes of the World Health Assembly. \nWe hope that a similar inclusive approach will prevail in \nrespect of other international institutions and processes, \nso that Taiwan, and others currently excluded, can \nparticipate and contribute meaningfully for the good of \nhumankind.\n\nResolution 66/288 calls for a frank assessment of \nour global decision-making structure. It requires bold \nbut rational political commitment on a global scale. \nAs leaders of our global family, we must be brutally \nhonest in accepting the fact that unless we act now to \nshape the future we want for our children and their \nchildren\u2019s children, the prospects for success will be \nbleak. As we chart the path towards the future we want, \nwe must address the fundamental threats to the security \nand very existence of the members of this family of \nnations. Once again I call on all of us to ask ourselves \nthe question, \u201cWhose interests are we pursuing? Are \nwe here to secure the future of each other\u2019s children \nor just our own?\u201d This is the greatest moral challenge \nfacing us today.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me, \nat the outset, to congratulate the new President of the \nGeneral Assembly, Mr. John Ashe, his predecessor, \nMr. Vuk Jeremi., and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \nfor the work they have carried out since the previous \nsession. \n\nThe theme of this session, \u201cThe post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage\u201d, is very much at \nthe heart of our concerns. The 2015 deadline we have \nset for ourselves will soon be upon us. The general \nimpression is that a number of countries continue \nto fall short in terms of funding the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), official development \nassistance and debt relief. It is unfortunate to note that \nall of the commitments made to boost economies and \ndevelopment efforts have not achieved the expected \nresults, despite major international mobilization.\n\nThere is a strong possibility that the 2015 deadline \nwill fall well short of many countries\u2019 expectations, \nespecially in Africa \u2014 since poverty persists, despite \nthe development and implementation of national \npoverty eradication strategies. That is why \u2014 drawing \non lessons learned from the shortfalls in setting and \nimplementing the MDGs \u2014 the African continent \nintends to establish a post-2015 development agenda \nthat is capable of meeting its expectations and it calls \nupon the international community to support it.\n\nOn top of the development challenges come \nother security challenges. New hotspots and wars are \nemerging all over the continent. Coupled with that, the \nterrorism phenomenon has taken a heavy toll, as was \nthe case earlier in Mali and now in Kenya. \n\nTerrorism is a scourge that knows no borders. \nIt feeds off of the blood of the poor, spreading its \nrecruitment tools of ignorance, poverty and fanaticism. \nNo good can ever come from violence carried out \nagainst peaceful populations while using supposed \nreligious considerations or doctrines as a pretext. \nSuch violence is totally contrary to the principles of \ninternational law, in terms of human rights and the right \nto freedom of religion and opinion. Our profound belief \nis that the fight against terrorism must continue to the \nlast breath, in order to curb proliferation and eradicate \nit definitively.\n\nChad, for its part, has made its strategic choice. \nIt has decided to make its modest contribution to \nthe establishment of peace, security and stability \nwherever necessary. That fundamental position is the \nkey motivation of its candidature for non-permanent \nmembership in the Security Council for the period \n2014-2015. To that end, my country expects friendly, \nactive and enthusiastic support from the Assembly, to \nencourage its valiant people to continue to provide their \nutmost effort in supporting the cause of international \npeace and security, which are indispensible to \nestablishing a world based on stability, development \nand democracy.\n\nSince restoring its stability, Chad has remained \nmindful of all crisis situations in Africa and in the \nworld. It intends to fully cooperate with the United \nNations on all positive initiatives aimed at peace and \nsecurity, wherever the need may arise. \n\nMy country provided a clear indication of its \nunshakeable resolve through efforts with the United \nNations Mission in the Central African Republic and \nChad (MINURCAT) in the eastern part of Chad, from \n2008 to 2010 protecting Sudanese refugees from Darfur \nand Chadian internally displaced persons and ensuring \nthe security of humanitarian personnel and associated \nUnited Nations personnel. \n\n\n\f\nTrue to its philosophy, Chad sent the largest armed \ncontingent to Mali, with more than 2,000 men, and 900 \nto the Central African Republic. Some 1,800 Chadian \nsoldiers will join the new United Nations force in Mali. \nChadian peacekeepers are now present in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, \nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and Haiti as part \nof United Nations peacekeeping missions.\n\nWe take this solemn opportunity to formally \ncommend the successful completion of the transition \nprocess in Mali, with the holding of free, regular \ndemocratic elections unanimously hailed by the \nentire international community. Our wish is for that \nfraternal country to restore peace, unity and stability \nso that its sons and daughters can focus their energies \nand intelligence on progress and the well-being of the \npopulation.\n\nHowever, the situation in the Central African \nRepublic remains alarming. The insecurity and the \npolitical, economic and financial difficulties that \ncontinue to face the transitional Government represent \nmajor challenges of concern to everyone. The countries \nof the region, through the Economic Community of \nCentral African States, have made their utmost effort \nto mobilize military, financial and human resources to \nsupport peace and security in that country. \n\nI wish to welcome the establishment of the \nMission internationale de soutien \u00e0 la Centrafrique \nsous conduite africaine, of which the Central Africa \nMultinational Force comprises the core. Its troop \nlevel will increase from 2,000 to 3,600, thanks to \nthe participation of Central African States and other \nfriendly countries that have shown an interest in joining \nthat noble cause. In spite of all those efforts, we must \nrecognize that the needs on the ground clearly highlight \nthe need for swift intervention, admittedly in the spirit \nof regional solidarity but also with the vital support of \nthe international community. To that end, we expect \nthe Security Council to adopt a firm resolution that \nprovides for logistical and financial support modalities \nfor the mission.\n\nTurning to the Sudan, as the Assembly knows, \nwe signed a peace accord on 15 January 2010 and \nestablished a joint force that has allowed us to stabilize \nour common borders. As a result, my country will \ncontinue to actively strive for peace in the Sudan, as \na member of the follow-up committee for the Darfur \nPeace Agreement.\n\nNevertheless, I think it would be timely to draw the \nattention of the Assembly to the humanitarian situation \nin Darfur as a result of the new hotbeds of tension that \nare emerging and which lead to a constant flow of other \nrefugees and internally displaced persons towards \neastern Chad. Currently, there are more than 400,000 \nrefugees and 200,000 internally displaced persons, \ncompared to 290,000 and 180,000 in past years. All \nefforts made since the outbreak of that crisis to foster \nthe return of refugees and internally displaced persons \nto their regions of origin have been in vain thus far. It is \nour duty to advocate from this rostrum for the energetic \npursuit of assistance from the international community \nto all those people as political and ethnic tensions \ncontinue to divert them from their path to return.\n\nChad condemns the rampant instability in the \neastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \nWe urge the Government and the members of the \nrebellion to reach a negotiated solution to their dispute \nto allow that great African country to focus on its \ndevelopment.\n\nOur profound belief is that the solution to all \nthe crises I have just listed cannot be military. A \nlasting, definitive solution to the ills that are hobbling \nthe development of Africa requires a constant \nstruggle against poverty, marginalization and youth \nunemployment. It also requires the establishment of \nconstructive dialogue among the various sectors of \na country, on the one hand, and permanent dialogue \namong different cultures and religions, on the other.\n\nAddressing the situation outside Africa, I must first \nmention the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which persists \nand for which the international community has not yet \nfound the appropriate solutions. We urge and encourage \nthe efforts made by the Organization and the United \nStates Government to conclude a peace agreement that \nallows for the peaceful coexistence of two sovereign \nStates.\n\nThe situation in Syria troubles us all since it has \nreached a particularly grave stage. We have no right \nto allow a whole people to be cast adrift. The use of \nchemical weapons, which marks a dramatic escalation \nof the civil war in that country, is an affront to the \nhuman conscience and to the ideals present at the birth \nof the Organization. While welcoming the agreement \nbetween the United States and the Russian Federation \non the destruction of Syrian chemical weapons, my \ncountry wants to see the perpetrators of those crimes \nidentified and brought to an international tribunal. \n\n\n\f\nHowever, we are greatly saddened to see Syria tear itself \napart and Syrians killing each other. The international \ncommunity must do its utmost to stop that tragedy.\n\nAllow me to turn to Cuba. The embargo against \nCuba, which has been in place for decades, unjustly \npenalizes that country. We call for the lifting of the \nembargo in order to allow the country to resume the \nplace it deserves in the comity of nations.\n\nAt the national level, Chad, which has definitively \nturned the painful page of wars and divisions, is now \nfully devoted to its development by exploiting its \nmineral and energy resources through daring strategies. \nTo do that, it has just adopted a national development \nplan that will soon be the subject of a round table \non its funding and implementation. At the political \nlevel, we give pride of place to dialogue. We have \nestablished a permanent political dialogue framework \nthat brings together the majority and the opposition and \nhas the power, inter alia, to create structures for the \norganization of future elections. With the assistance of \nChad\u2019s partners, in particular the United Nations, we \nhave taken all the necessary steps to prevent and put \nan end to the recruitment and use of children in armed \nconflict.\n\nIn conclusion, allow me to reiterate a major concern \nfor my country. It is our ardent wish to finally see the \nlong-awaited reform in the United Nations, particularly \nthe Security Council. That reform, which has become \nan issue of justice and equity, is a top priority for \nAfrica. Keeping Africa, as well as other key actors on \nthe international scene, outside that universal forum \nappears shocking today to hundreds of millions of \nhuman beings throughout the world. The awakening of \nthe peoples of Africa, the role of the continent in the \nworld and its indispensable contribution to preventing \nand settling conflict means that our continent can no \nlonger be sidelined from the prestigious institution that \nis the Security Council.\n"

        "file_text": "The three pillars of the \nUnited Nations \u2014 peace and security, sustainable \ndevelopment, and human rights \u2014 are interlinked and \nmutually reinforcing. Respect for universal human \nrights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law is a \ncornerstone of international peace and stability.\n\nFragile, conflict-affected and least developed \ncountries face the biggest difficulties in ensuring \nsustainable development. Growing evidence shows that \nprogress on the Millenium Development Goals in those \nStates is impossible without first achieving peace and \nsecurity. That leads us to one of the cornerstones of \nthe new post-2015 vision: peace and security are basic \nconditions for a decent life and for the enjoyment of \nhuman rights.\n\nThe priorities of the Assembly\u2019s sixty-eighth \nsession are topical and very pertinent. The new \ndevelopment framework for post-2015 will remain high \non the United Nations agenda for the next two years \nand beyond. It should set out a comprehensive and \ncoherent framework around a single set of global goals, \ndriving action in all countries. A set of peacebuilding \ngoals should be high on the post-2015 agenda, in which \nthe United Nations should continue to play the leading \nrole in promoting the settlement of disputes by peaceful \nmeans.\n\nThe Middle East stands at a crossroads. Events there \nhave global impact, and the international community \nmust take decisive actions.\n\nWe deplore the continuing humanitarian \ncatastrophe in Syria. The easing of human suffering \nis the immediate goal, and we commend international \nefforts to that end. I would especially like to thank the \nneighbouring countries for hosting Syrian refugees. \nThe detailed report by the United Nations inspectors \nconfirms the use of chemical weapons against civilians \non 21 August. Those who committed war crimes \nand crimes against humanity in Syria must face the \nInternational Criminal Court. The agreement reached \nby the United States and Russia on the framework to \neliminate Syria\u2019s chemical weapons should be reflected \nin a Security Council resolution with the clear indication \nthat Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations \nwould be invoked in case of non-compliance.\n\nWe encourage the new Iranian leadership to \naddress the concerns of the international community. \nWe welcome the stated determination of the new \nIranian Government to resolve the nuclear issue, thus \nbuilding confidence in the peaceful nature of its nuclear \nprogramme.\n\nLatvia welcomes the reopening of direct Middle \nEast peace negotiations. Latvia praises the role \nof the United States as the mediator. Negotiations \nshould demonstrate the commitment of both parties \nto a peaceful settlement. We anticipate a two-State \nsolution \u2014 Israel and Palestine living side by side in \npeace and security.\n\nLatvia is convinced that the resolution of protracted \nconflicts in Moldova, Georgia and Nagorno Karabakh \nshould remain high on the international agenda. Efforts \nto resolve the conflicts should be increased.\n\nLatvia accumulated extensive experience during \nits transition to a free, just and democratic society. As \na European Union member State with that extensive \nexperience, we share it with countries in the European \nUnion\u2019s Eastern Partnership and Central Asia. Latvia \nwill continue to offer its expertise in such areas as \nthe rule of law and fundamental freedoms, thereby \ncontributing to good governance and further economic \ndevelopment in those countries. However, it is essential \nto keep in mind that national ownership is fundamental \nin any reform process, .\n\nLatvia is stepping up development assistance for \nAfghanistan and the Central Asian States, particularly \nin the areas of transportation and customs. We see \npotential for the further integration of those countries \ninto the global economy by developing international \n\n\n\f\ntrade routes. The Northern Distribution Network already \nconnects the region with Europe through Latvia. We \nare confident that it can also become a commercially \nviable long-term transit corridor after 2014.\n\nWe are approaching an important turning point in \nAfghanistan. In order to secure the progress achieved, \nthe international community must remain committed \nto the country\u2019s long-term development. Latvia will \ncontinue to support civilian policing and to train \nmilitary personnel. We will also provide financial aid \nto the Afghan National Security Forces as of 2015.\n\nSustainable development and prosperity go hand \nin hand. During times of recession, structural reforms \nand budgetary discipline, accompanied by economic \nstimulus, bring results. While we can observe signs \nof global economic recovery, there is no room for \ncomplacency. \n\nTo ensure robust economic growth, we need to \nensure that the young generation contributes to it. \nQuality education is the key to empowering people; \nit should reach all. Everybody should have lifelong \nlearning opportunities. Quality education is the \nfoundation on which peaceful, prosperous and dignified \nsocieties are built.\n\nFollowing the economic downturn in 2008, Latvia \nhas been the fastest growing European Union economy \nfor the past two years. We expect to maintain that strong \ngrowth trend at the level of at least 4 per cent annually \nfor the coming years. Latvia is now ready for further \nintegration into the global economy by introducing \nthe euro in 2014 and by joining the Organization for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development.\n\nAn empowered civil society is a key engine of \nsustainable development. We are proud that the people \nof Latvia are actively engaged in the decision-making \nprocess at all stages. In the twenty-first century the \npublic involvement\u2019s must be ensured both directly and \non line. Latvia has been working actively to protect \nand promote Internet freedom as an important element \nof freedom of expression for an open and democratic \nsociety.\n\nLatvia stands ready to contribute to the most \nfundamental goals that should figure on the post-2015 \nagenda, namely, promoting peace, human rights and \nfundamental freedoms. Therefore, we have put forward \nour candidacy for the elections to the Human Rights \nCouncil in 2014 and the Security Council in 2025. \nLatvia counts on the support of Member States and \ngives its assurance that it will contribute to the work of \nthose bodies in a responsible manner.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would \nlike to join previous speakers in congratulating the \nPresident of the General Assembly on his election to \nserve at its sixty-eighth session. I am confident that \nhis experience in international affairs will contribute \nto the success of this session. I would also like to take \nthis opportunity to commend his predecessor, Mr. Vuk \nJeremi., for his wise leadership during the last session, \nand to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his \nstaff for their tireless efforts to promote global peace, \nsecurity and development.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates continues to firmly \nbelieve in the purposes and principles of the United \nNations, as enshrined in its Charter, calling for the \nprotection of international peace and security, the \npromotion of peaceful coexistence among nations and \npeoples through the peaceful resolution of international \ndisputes, respect for the provisions of international \nlaw, and non-interference in the internal affairs of \nStates. Those goals also call for us to foster a climate \nfavourable to international relations based on tolerance, \nnon-violence and recognition of others. My country \nhas followed such an approach in its regional and \ninternational relations.\n\nHowever, we cannot conceal our deep concern at \nthe recent events in the Arab region associated with \nsectarian strife, an escalation in terrorist attacks \nand growing incitement to violence, which, in turn, \nhave given rise to extreme polarization in the region \nand among its peoples, severely impacting stability \nand development. In the Arab Gulf, we see how \nextremism and terrorism in the Kingdom of Bahrain \nare threatening to undermine security and stability and \ndestroy a history of tolerance in which sectarianism has \nnever played any role. The situation has been further \naggravated by the politicization and exploitation of \nthe religion of Islam by those seeking to use it as a \ntool to exclude and marginalize other segments of \nsociety, which, until now, had all lived in constructive, \nharmonious and peaceful coexistence.\n\nAll of this has led to widespread fears about the \nfate of the national State and what that implies in \nterms of the undermining of the pillars of the State, \nthe wasting of its resources and the weakening of its \neconomy. As members may be aware, such difficult \nconditions have put the young people of the region in \njeopardy of falling into the clutches of extremism and \nviolence, especially in a climate of growing despair and \nlack of opportunities.\n\nThat is why the United Arab Emirates gives \nparamount importance to its efforts aimed at promoting \n\na culture of moderation and non-violence and fighting \nextremism in all its forms. In that regard, I refer in \nparticular to my country\u2019s initiative to fight extremism \nthrough the Hedayah International Centre of Excellence \nfor Countering Violent Extremism. The United Arab \nEmirates actually proposed the Centre\u2019s establishment \nat a meeting held here at the United Nations, and today \nthe Centre is seeing the light.\n\nIn that context, I can only condemn in the strongest \npossible terms all cowardly attacks, but particularly \nthe terrorist attack committed at the shopping centre \nin Nairobi, which resulted in the deaths of dozens of \ninnocent victims.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates is deeply disappointed \nat the international community\u2019s inability to put an \nimmediate end to the worsening tragedy of the brotherly \nSyrian people caused by continual military actions and \nindiscriminate and systematic bombings by Syrian \nforces in Damascus. So far, more than 100,000 people \nhave been killed and millions of people have been \ninjured or displaced. This is an extremely dangerous \nviolation of international law and international \nhumanitarian law.\n\nWe are deeply concerned at the increasingly serious \nimplications of the conflict in Syria and the entire region. \nWe strongly condemn and reject all crimes against \nhumanity committed by the Syrian regime, especially \nthe chemical attack against Ghouta, Damascus, which \nkilled thousands of civilians, including children. \nWe therefore call upon the international community \nto take all measures necessary to punish the Syrian \nregime for its massacring of civilians. The Assembly \nshould be aware of the frustration that we and the \nmajority of countries in the region feel with respect \nto the dysfunction of United Nations mechanisms that \ncould have prevented the Syrian regime\u2019s aggressive \nacts against its own people. The Organization\u2019s failure \nto act is directly responsible for exacerbating the \nhumanitarian tragedy that we are witnessing in Syria \ntoday. It is also responsible for the threat to the Syrian \nState, Syrian society and the Syrian people.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates has fulfilled its \nresponsibilities with respect to ongoing relief operations \nfor the Syrian people and continues to provide all kinds \nof aid \u2014 building hospitals, providing medical supplies \nand staffing medical teams. It calls for concerted \ninternational and regional efforts, directly or through \ninternational organizations, to meet the humanitarian \nneeds of Syrians displaced inside Syria and across \nthe country\u2019s borders, with a view to alleviating their \nsuffering.\n\nIn that context, we are seeking in these meetings \nto address the issues of our region, its stability and \nits future. That the issues and events that take place \nin Egypt are very important and cannot be overlooked \nis beyond question. Egypt is a pivotal State whose \nstability and civil peace signify that the region is \nbeginning to recover. Accordingly, the United Arab \nEmirates is following with great interest the positive \ndevelopments that are occurring in Egypt, as we firmly \nbelieve that Egypt plays a key role in ensuring stability, \ndevelopment and prosperity. There is no doubt that a \nstable and calm Egypt is vital to security and peace, \nnot only in the Arab region, but in the world as a whole.\n\nOn 30 June, Egypt experienced a second wave of \nrevolution, when tens of millions of Egyptians expressed \ntheir resolute will to draw up a road map for a better \nfuture for their country. In it the ground is laid for an \ninclusive democratic path based on the participation of \nall segments of society without any exceptions, within \nthe framework of a policy characterized by moderation, \ncentrism, non-violence and the non-use of religion as a \nmeans to exclude or classify or to foment sectarianism or \nhatred. The United Arab Emirates therefore believes that \nthe sovereign measures implemented by the Egyptian \nGovernment to protect national security and the steps \nit has taken to implement the road map supported by \nthe people give grounds for optimism and enhance the \nEgyptian Government\u2019s credibility. I would also take \nthis opportunity to urge the international community to \nstand behind Egypt at this critical juncture and support \nthe sincere efforts of its interim Government to lay \nthe foundations of stability, development and civilian \nconstitutional rule.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates recognizes the suffering \nof the Arab region caused by the interference of others \nin its internal affairs and the ensuing threats to national \nstatehood generally. We therefore wish to warn of the \ndanger of interfering in the domestic affairs of Egypt \nand call on everyone to refrain from disrupting the \ncountry\u2019s march towards stability and democracy.\n\nThe issues that the Arab region faces are all \ninterconnected. Everyone in this Hall realizes that \npeace emerges as a central and relevant issue to all \nthat is occurring there. Although many decades have \npassed, the Palestinian people continue to look forward \n\n\n\f\nto realizing their right to self-determination and the \nestablishment of an independent State, with East \nJerusalem as its capital, based on international legal \ninstruments that recognize their right to establish a \nState, in line with the 4 June 1967 borders, as confirmed \nby United Nations resolutions and in accordance with \nthe Arab Peace Initiative.\n\nIn that regard, I wish to take this opportunity \nto welcome the relaunching of peace talks under the \nauspices of the United States. We hope that those \ntalks will lead to positive results in the form of the \nestablishment of a Palestinian State. We also welcome \nthe European Union\u2019s constructive position consisting \nof non-recognition of the legitimacy of the Israeli \nsettlements and the decision to cease its dealings with \nthem. The United Arab Emirates is ready to contribute \nto a successful outcome of the new initiative in order \nto achieve security, peace and economic growth in that \nimportant part of the world.\n\nSecurity and stability in the Gulf region represent \na high priority in the balanced policy that we have \nderived from principles found in the Charter of the \nUnited Nations and the provisions of international law, \nespecially those that call for peaceful coexistence, \nconfidence-building, good neighbourliness, mutual \nrespect, non-interference in the internal affairs of States, \nand the pursuit of peaceful means in the resolution of \nconflicts and disputes. Based on those principles, my \nGovernment expresses, once again, its regret at the \ncontinued Iranian occupation of our three islands \u2014 Abu \nMusa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb \u2014 and demands \nthat the undiminished sovereignty of the United Arab \nEmirates over those islands be fully restored.\n\nWe emphasize that all actions and measures taken \nby the Iranian occupation authorities are considered \nnull and void and are contrary to international law \nand all norms of common human values. Therefore, \nwe call upon the international community to urge Iran \nto respond to my country\u2019s repeated peaceful, sincere \nrequest for a just settlement of the dispute, either \nthrough direct, serious negotiations between our two \nnations or by referring the case to the International \nCourt of Justice, in accordance with the principles of \nthe Charter of the United Nations and the provisions of \ninternational law.\n\nActing from our firm principles in regional and \ninternational relations, we welcome the declared \napproach of Mr. Hassan Rouhani, President of the \nIslamic Republic of Iran. We affirm that our country \nwill sincerely cooperate with him in the interest of \npromoting security, stability and prosperity in the \nregion.\n\nThere has been considerable debate about Iran\u2019s \nnuclear programme. Many suspicions revolve around \nit. Therefore, we urge Iran to constructively cooperate \nwith the International Atomic Energy Agency, defuse \nall scepticism about the peaceful nature of its nuclear \nactivities, and act with full transparency and clarity \nto avoid any negative consequences that could arise \nfrom the absence of such cooperation. The United Arab \nEmirates does, however, believe that the peaceful use \nof nuclear energy has become an urgent requirement to \nmeet today\u2019s growing demand for energy.\n\nWe are proud that we are a nation that has pioneered \npeaceful uses of nuclear energy, which are surrounded \nby all possible security and safety guarantees. The \nUnited Arab Emirates has opened the way for the \nintroduction of renewable energy and the development \nof clean-energy technologies as its contribution to \nhumankind in protecting the planet from the negative \neffects of climate change.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates firmly believes in \nthe necessity of achieving human development at the \nnational and international levels. That goal can be \nachieved only when a number of conditions are met, \nincluding respect for human rights and for the equality \nof all without discrimination on the basis of gender, \nethnicity, religion, language or any other ground. That \nrequires due regard for human dignity, the renunciation \nof violence and the prohibition of torture and abuse. \nThe United Arab Emirates has been encouraged by the \npositive response to its periodic report by the members \nof the Human Rights Council, who commended the \ncountry\u2019s achievements and progress.\n\nAchieving overall human development requires the \ncreation of an environment conducive to tolerance and \nmoderation, free of any incitement to hatred. In that \ncontext, it is necessary to support and promote dialogue \namong different countries and religions, without \narrogance or superiority on the part of any culture over \nanother, because each culture has something to give \nand something to gain with respect to another\u2019s culture.\n\nThe empowerment of women, the recognition \nof their vital role in communities and the protection \nof women against discrimination in various fields \nare imperatives for the international community. \n\n\n\f\nThe United Arab Emirates is proud of the significant \nmeasures it has taken in that respect, which have won \nthe United Arab Emirates a high ranking among the \ncountries in the region. Our country has also made \nsignificant strides in combating human trafficking, \nand it has developed national legislation to stand firm \nagainst that inhumane crime.\n\nAchieving sustainable development for all people \nis a major priority for the United Nations and its \nMember States and one which will require scientific \nand technical cooperation, as well as the transfer \nof technology between developed and developing \ncountries, to further the common good of all peoples \nand countries of the world.\n"

        "file_text": "Thirteen years have passed since the adoption of \nthe Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2), and \nthe established deadline to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals is rapidly approaching. The world \nhas changed since then, and we anticipate that, in the \nnext 15 years, it will change a great deal more. \n\nIn that context, the main theme of the general \ndebate, \u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: setting the \nstage\u201d, is obviously very appropriate and relevant. We \nare convinced that the new development agenda will \nprovide a clear vision for our post-2015 development. It \nshould be formulated in the best spirit of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, with special attention to the issues \nof poverty eradication, education and health care, the \neconomy and employment, governance, agriculture and \nfood availability, energy, peace and security.\n\nThe need for a common agenda is unquestionable. \nAll countries must enthusiastically embark on the path \nof sustainable development. The global challenges can \nbe effectively met if they are included as core priorities \nin each country\u2019s development strategy. \n\nKyrgyzstan has done its part. That is reflected \nin the national sustainable development strategy of \nthe Kyrgyz Republic for 2013-2017, which identifies \nfive-year targets and plans for a transition to sustainable \ndevelopment, culminating in 2017. Our vision is to \nform a stable country where human rights, freedom and \nsecurity are guaranteed, where a multi-ethnic society \nis governed with equal adherence to the rule of law, \nand where all prerequisites for sustainable economic \ngrowth and a decent standard of life are the norm. The \ntasks ahead are complex, and we believe they should be \naddressed in partnership with the United Nations and \nthe international community.\n\nThe main strategic resource for the green economic \ngrowth of Kyrgyzstan is water. The role of water has \nincreased significantly due to the major challenge of \nsustainable development posed by global climate change, \nwhich is already affecting our region negatively. Most \nimportantly with regard to the state of water resources, \nKyrgyzstan\u2019s glaciers have shrunk by 30 per cent as \na result of global warming. According to preliminary \nexpert forecasts, unless urgent measures are taken \nthere will be practically no glaciers or snowfields on \nthe country\u2019s territory by the year 2100. Those melting \nwaters are the primary source of the rivers of Central \nAsia.\n\nThis ongoing negative trend may well lead to a \nsubstantial reduction of river flow in Kyrgyzstan, \nand consequently to social and economic tensions in \nthe region as a whole. We must pursue our work in \nthe Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change. The relevant \ninternational financial and ecological organizations \nmust continue to assist the countries of Central Asia in \naddressing the problem. That is particularly important \nin the transition to a sustainable use of both water and \nnatural ecosystems resources.\n\nThe development of hydro-energy is strategically \nimportant to the sustainable socioeconomic development \nof the region. We are convinced that it would contribute \nto an integrated solution of many current and future \nchallenges. We believe that the construction of large \nhydroelectric power facilities should be considered one \npath to clean development. Harnessing the hydropower \npotential of the upstream countries should be considered \npart of low-carbon development, and developing water \nresources should be considered the core model for \ngreen development in the economic progress of the \nregion. We are ready to participate in an exchange of \n\n\n\f\nbest practices in water management, water use and the \nconstruction of irrigation systems.\n\nMore than 90 per cent of Kyrgyzstan is located in \nmountainous areas, which play an important role in the \naccumulation of water. In that regard, we support the \nfurther promotion of the developmental goals of the \nmountain regions, in accordance with the decisions \ntaken at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment. I am confident that a draft resolution on \nthe issue, to be submitted to the General Assembly at \nthis session with the co-sponsorship of Kyrgyzstan, \nwill enjoy the support of all United Nations Members.\n\nSome mountainous landlocked countries have \nspecial needs for development. High levels of poverty, \nisolation, the burden of transportation costs and a heavy \ndebt are among the basic range of problems that many \nmountainous countries face. In such conditions, it is \ndifficult to achieve the Millennium Development Goals \nand to meet the commitments set out in United Nations \ndocuments on sustainable development. We hope that \nthe special needs, problems and challenges of mountain \ncountries and communities will be properly reflected in \nthe post-2015 development programme.\n\nIt is well known that mountain ranges provide \nvaluable ecosystem services and serve as important \nindicator of environmental health and a support system \nfor the snow leopard, a rare and endangered highland \nanimal. In that regard, Kyrgyzstan is developing a \n10-year national protection strategy. We invite everyone \nto the world forum on the snow leopard to be held on \n22 and 23 October in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. \n\nThe rehabilitation and security of uranium tailings, \nwhich today total more than 8 million cubic metres \non our territory, is very important in Kyrgyzstan. The \nsituation is aggravated by the fact that most are located \nin seismically active mudflow and flood-prone areas \nwith high groundwater levels, as well near the banks \nof rivers that form the basis of the Central Asian water \nsupply. The potential consequences of ineffective \nsolutions would have a very negative impact on millions \nof people in Central Asia.\n\nIn order to raise the international community\u2019s \nawareness of the problem and to attract additional \nassistance towards its solution, at this session the \nKyrgyz delegation will introduce a draft resolution \nunder agenda item 19 (j), \u201cThe role of the international \ncommunity in the prevention of the radiation threat in \nCentral Asia\u201d. We call on members to support the draft \nresolution.\n\nIt is well known that development and security are \nclosely interrelated. Unfortunately, the maintenance of \nsecurity and stability and the fight against international \nterrorism, religious extremism, and illicit drug and \narms trafficking and trade remain on the development \nagenda of Kyrgyzstan and our region. Those issues are \nmost acute in our region because of the current situation \nin Afghanistan. \n\nDespite some progress in the political process in \nAfghanistan, the stability and security of the country \nremain at risk. Furthermore, the Afghan drug-\nproduction trade, being the largest in the world, is \ngenerating a whole range of threats and destabilizing \nboth the political and military situation in Eurasia. \nThose problems are more critical and significant in \nour region than ever before, especially in view of the \nupcoming withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan in \n2014.\n\nKyrgyzstan, in accordance with its commitments, \nhas fully complied with its mission in counter-terrorism \noperations in Afghanistan. Over the past 12 years, \nKyrgyzstan has provided an important channel for \nthe supply of military and humanitarian goods to \nAfghanistan through the transit centre at Manas \nInternational Airport. We believe that the international \ncommunity\u2019s efforts have contributed to the relative \nstabilization of the situation in Afghanistan and helped \nthe Afghan authorities to assume their leadership role \nand responsibility in the fields of public administration \nand development. We are determined to continue our \nstrategic dialogue with partners on all issues of mutual \ninterest. We believe that in the fight against terrorism, \ndrug trafficking and other security challenges stemming \nfrom Afghanistan, regional organizations have proved \ntheir effectiveness and should be even more involved. I \nam talking here in particular of the Collective Security \nTreaty Organization and the Shanghai Cooperation \nOrganization. Kyrgyzstan\u2019s chairmanship of those \ninternational and regional organizations this year has \nonce again confirmed the need to have comprehensive \nmeasures in place to stabilize the situation as soon as \npossible, both in Afghanistan and in the region as a \nwhole. \n\nAlong with other measures to combat security \nchallenges and threats, it is necessary to pursue a policy \nof industrialization aimed at building a sustainable \n\n\n\f\nAfghan economy in order to achieve socioeconomic \ngrowth in the country. It is also important to involve \nAfghanistan in the development of regional cooperation \nand the implementation of major joint socioeconomic \nand infrastructural projects such as the export of \nelectricity and the building of roads and railroad \nnetworks.\n\nIn that respect, Kyrgyzstan stands ready to expand \nits trade and economic relations and to implement \nvarious infrastructural projects, including the export \nof electricity to Afghanistan as part of the CASA-1000 \nproject and the establishment of a tripartite \u2014 Kyrgyzstan-\nTajikistan-Afghanistan \u2014 agro-industrial consortium, \nwith the assistance of the United Nations.\n\nToday we must take a fundamentally new approach \nto solving Afghanistan\u2019s problems, based on a new \nphilosophy and paradigm of social development: the \nright to development.\n\nI should like to take this opportunity to invite \nrepresentatives of Government and academia to \ntake part in the international research conference on \n\u201cAfghanistan \u2014 2014\u201d, to be held on 10 October 2013 \nin the capital of Kyrgyzstan, Bishkek.\n\nWe are following developments in the Arab world \nwith special attention. The continuing two-year armed \nconflict in Syria is of great concern. Kyrgyzstan \nexpresses its serious concern about the numerous \nvictims of the armed conflict, the humanitarian disaster \nit represents and the further escalation of the crisis. We \ncall upon both sides to immediately call a ceasefire \nand resolve the crisis peacefully through a dialogue \nbetween all political forces of the country under the \nmediation of the United Nations. \n\nWe support the initiative of the transfer of Syrian \nchemical weapons and their subsequent destruction, \nunder international supervision, and Syria\u2019s accession to \nthe Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, \nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons \nand on Their Destruction. We wish to see the restoration \nof stability in the country and the preservation of the \nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria, without \nexternal military interference.\n\nThe changes occurring in the modern world and \nits increasing diversity require the strengthening of the \nUnited Nations so as to ensure that it continues to play its \ncentral role of ensuring global security and the effective \nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals. \nThat can be achieved through reforming the United \nNations, which should be done in accordance with the \npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United \nNations and on the basis of a broad consensus on the \npart of States Members of the United Nations.\n\nWe believe that all States Members of the United \nNations should strictly comply with the decisions of \nthe Security Council; we are in favour of expanding its \nmembership in order to make it more representative, \ntransparent and democratic.\n\nWe attach particular importance to the work of the \nEconomic and Social Council. Kyrgyzstan therefore \nwelcomed the adoption last week of resolution 68/1, on \nstrengthening the role and enhancing the effectiveness \nof the work of the Council. We hope that a strengthened \nCouncil will become an effective mechanism for the \nimplementation of the post-2015 development agenda \nand continue to serve as an important platform for \nmultilateral political dialogue on global social and \neconomic issues.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize the need \nto move forward firmly and resolutely by means of joint \nefforts and a common resolve on the part of all countries \nin order to overcome threats and challenges, maintain \npeace and well-being and promote development for \nfuture generations. Kyrgyzstan is fully prepared to \nengage in such constructive and effective international \ncooperation.\n"

        "file_text": " I would first \nlike to warmly congratulate you, Mr. President, on your \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits current session, and to express my full appreciation \nto the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban \nKi-moon, who has closely followed developments in the \nsituation in Lebanon. \n\n\n\f\nI particularly wish to point out the presidential \nstatement issued by the Security Council on 10 July \n(S/PRST/2013/9), which provides an effective road \nmap for what the international community can do to \nhelp Lebanon in order to preserve its stability, promote \nits institutions, support its economy and army and to \nhelp it face the growing burden created by the refugees \nentering from Syria. That is definitely the core objective \nof the meeting of the International Support Group for \nLebanon, which will be launched tomorrow afternoon, \n25 September.\n\nMany countries represented here have witnessed \nuprisings, civil wars or foreign aggression. Lebanon, \ntoo, has experienced many wars, which have led to \ninfluxes of numerous refugees in our territory. Against \nall odds, the Lebanese have sought to assume the \nresponsibility for restoring the glory of our country \nas a space for freedom and coexistence and to hallow \ntheir presence in the East within the confines of a State \nthat embraced democracy from its very inception while \nensuring respect for diversity within unity as well as \npersonal and public freedoms. \n\nThrough dialogue, the Lebanese will continue \nto develop their political system and improve their \ndemocratic practices. They will have to remain \ncommitted to the Baabda Declaration, which advocates \nLebanon distancing itself from regional crises and axis \npolitics. It is equally essential to reach an agreement \non a national strategy to ensure the exclusive defence \nof Lebanon in the face of Israel\u2019s hostility and ongoing \nthreats. \n\nNevertheless, however strong the Lebanese \ncommitment may be, we still require the care and \nsupport of brotherly and friendly countries in order \nto address the repercussions of external conflicts and \ncrises that threaten our security and stability and have \nnegative impacts on our socioeconomic situation. The \nLebanese look to assistance not only in the name of \nbrotherly solidarity and the shared responsibility of the \ninternational community as a whole, but also in the face \nof events that pose a threat to regional and international \nsecurity. \n\nThe first challenge is rooted in the repercussions \nof the Syrian crisis on Lebanon\u2019s security and \neconomy. An existential challenge has arisen, related \nto the growing number of Syrian refugees on Lebanese \nterritory, which is far beyond Lebanon\u2019s capacity to \nassimilate them. The number of refugees has already \nexceeded one quarter of the Lebanese population. As \nthe Assembly knows, Lebanon is a country of limited \ngeographical area and resources, as well as sensitive \nbalances. \n\nTherefore, while we understand that it is not possible \nto impose the impossible on nations, it is important \nfor me to reiterate my call on the States Members of \nthe United Nations to provide sufficient human and \nfinancial resources to manage the presence of Syrian \nrefugees in Lebanon and meet their humanitarian \nand essential needs, bearing in mind that the pledges \nundertaken at the meeting of donor States hosted by the \nState of Kuwait on 30 January have only been partially \nfulfilled; to expand infrastructure and reception areas \nfor Syrian refugees within Syrian territories themselves \nand organize an international conference on the issue \nof Syrian refugees, with the aim of sharing the burden \namong different countries in accordance with the \nprinciple of shared responsibility while also assisting \nthe International Support Group for Lebanon; and to \ngarner support from all concerned States for the work \nof the International Support Group. Of course, all of \nthat must take place while we work towards finding a \npolitical solution for the Syrian crisis that will preserve \nthe unity of Syria. \n\nLebanon has called attention to the need to bring \nto justice the perpetrators of the crimes that have been \ncommitted. Solutions must be found to ensure that the \nconflict does not spread to neighbouring countries. \nToday, we have an opportunity to condemn all terrorist \nattacks perpetrated anywhere in the world, particularly \nin the Middle East. \n\nI would like to comment on the attack that took \nplace upon the historic town of Maaloula. That attack \nrepresents an assault on civilization and the tolerant \nspirit of religions. That is why the international \ncommunity must adopt a firm stance in order to protect \nsuch sites, in particular through the adoption of an \ninvestigative mechanism that will assess the reality of \nthe situation on the ground. \n\nWe must work to encourage the countries of the \nregion currently engaged in conflict to ensure that the \nlogic of dialogue and negotiation prevails and to keep \nLebanon from getting involved in the Syrian conflict, \nwhile encouraging those countries to contribute the \nnecessary assistance and support for the Baabda \nDeclaration, just as the Security Council has pledged \nits support. \n\n\n\f\nHowever, the main challenge that we face remains \nthe Arab-Israeli conflict and Israeli settlement policy \npractices, not to overlook the difficulties created by it \nin terms of refugee flows. The settlement policy has \nfostered a sense of frustration and a tendency towards \nextremism. Lebanon has been affected by the daily \nIsraeli attacks against Lebanon and its infrastructure \nthrough the use of all sorts of prohibited weapons. \nLebanon has paid a high price for those acts of \naggression, with all that implies in terms of the burden \non human lives and destruction. It therefore falls upon \nthe international community to work to find a fair and \ncomprehensive solution to the conflict in the Middle \nEast, particularly with respect to the Palestinian cause, \npursuant to the terms of reference of the Madrid \nConference and the Arab Peace Initiative. Stability, \ndemocracy and moderation will not prevail in the \nMiddle East unless justice is done in Palestine, based \non the belief that the security of the Arab region and \nthe preservation of its cultural diversity are of strategic \nimportance. \n\nLebanon calls for the adoption of an integrated \ncomprehensive approach that includes the participation \nof all States concerned and addresses all aspects of the \nIsraeli-Arab conflict. At the same time, no solution \nshould be taken at the expense of its superior interests. \nAs a result, Lebanon will reject any compromise \nattempting to force an influx of Palestinian refugees \non its territory.\n\nIn this transitional period where the Arab world \nis undergoing major historic upheaval and deep-\nwrought changes, the world as a whole is witnessing an \nfundamentl structural transformation due to the amazing \nscientific progress that has been achieved, in particular \nin the fields of communication and information. That \nprogress will contribute to globalization in all aspects of \nlife. We must therefore convey a spirit of pluralism and \ndiversity within all societies as a necessary condition in \norder to match the accelerating pace of change. \n\nHowever, the regimes that run the affairs of peoples \nand societies have unfortunately not undergone a \ncorresponding evolution at the intellectual level. On the \ncontrary, we have witnessed conflicts exacerbated by \nextremist terrorism continue to spring forth fuelled by \nisolationism that rejects dialogue, mutual recognition \nand coexistence. That has even led some to call for \nthe return to religious emirates and racial segregation. \nIn order to do so, those groups have applied violent \nmethods that flout peace and public freedoms. \n\nAmid those unilateral fundamentalist tendencies, \nLebanon remains a laboratory and a model of necessary \ncoexistence for the future. That model must be allowed \nto benefit from support and stability because, as it has \nfor decades, it has led to the education of students in our \nschools and universities and caused the security forces \nto fulfil their national missions in military camps in a \nspirit of unity. It is a model that is also experienced by \nthe citizens on a daily basis on the streets of our cities, \ntowns and in our capital, in the theatres, clubs, at the \nmovies, in public and private institutions and in civil \nsociety organizations. The model, which has become \na lifestyle, is lived with the sound of the church bells \nand the voices of the mosques\u2019 muezzins ringing in \nour ears, in particular at joint celebrations, the most \nsignificant of which is the Common Religious National \nDay, celebrated on the day of the Annunciation on \n25 March of every year, when everyone is urged to seek \nthe common good. \n\nThe management of diversity and the building of \na culture of justice, peace and coexistence between \ncultures, civilizations and religions requires that we all \nmake efforts at the following three levels.\n\nFirst, we must work to improve the political, \nfinancial and social systems that govern the affairs \nof peoples worldwide, in particular the democratic \nsystem, to make them more humane and better suited \nto diversity. This must be done in such a way so as to \nguarantee the involvement of all components of society, \nin particular minorities, in political life and in the \nmanagement of public affairs in all States, regardless \nof what ratio of the population such minorities may \nrepresent, but, rather, on the basis of their capacity and \nheritage.\n\nSecondly, we must consider the preservation of an \nactive presence on the part of minorities worldwide, \nwith all the civilizations and specific characteristics \nthat they represent, to be an international responsibility, \nespecially in the Middle East. The Middle East is the \ncradle of the monotheistic religions, whose peoples \nhave coexisted for centuries, forged civilizations \nand enriched the history of humankind through their \nculture and the values of tolerance, goodwill and \nfriendship. That shared responsibility cannot be based \non international interests in that part of the world while \nignoring the communities living there. Rather, it should \ntake into account the interests of all of those minorities \nand their right to participate in all aspects of the life of \ntheir nation, as they are an integral part of its fabric.\n\n\n\f\nThirdly, there is a need to intensify ongoing efforts \naimed at reforming and developing the United Nations \nand its specialized agencies, so as to bring them into \nline with current realities and restore confidence in their \ncapacity to resolve international issues, counter crime \nand adopt the appropriate resolutions and implement \nthem without obstruction, free from selectivity and \nthe policy of double standards. That would be an \nalternative to the logic of legitimate force that may be \nused by peoples whose countries have fallen victim to \naggression and occupation, in the absence of a capable, \nguaranteed international mechanism.\n\nFor its part, Lebanon will remain faithful to \nthe message of freedom and coexistence that are its \nhallmark, reiterating its commitment to implementing \nall decisions of international legitimacy and to upholding \nthe spirit of moderation and agreement upon which \nLebanon was founded. It will also remain an active \npartner in the context of the promotion of a culture of \njustice, peace and sustainable human development.\n"

        "file_text": "I bring you sincere \ngreetings and very best wishes from His Excellency \nMr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President of the Republic of \nSierra Leone. President Koroma regrets that he is unable \nto participate in the general debate of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session due to unavoidable \ncircumstances. He has, however, instructed me, as \nhis Minister for Foreign Affairs and International \nCooperation, to deliver to the Assembly this message \nof goodwill:\n\n\u201cI congratulate Ambassador Ashe most \nwarmly on his election to direct the affairs of the \nAssembly during this session and assure him of \nmy country\u2019s support and cooperation during his \n\f\ntenure. Let me avail myself of this opportunity to \nalso express the appreciation of my delegation to \nhis predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremi. of Serbia, for his \nable leadership in directing the work of the General \nAssembly during the past session. I wish him well \nin his future endeavours. Let me also express \nsincere appreciation to the Secretary-General, \nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his constructive and fruitful \nleadership of the Organization. Sierra Leone will \ncontinue to support the progressive implementation \nof his five-year Global Action Agenda.\n\u201cOver the past two decades, global peace, \nsecurity and the economic environment have \nevidently been radically transformed, to the point \nwhere neither the problems nor their solutions are \nsimple. The international security situation has \nbecome more complex. Regional hotspot issues keep \nflaring up, and turbulence continues in many parts \nof the world, in particular Asia and Africa. Human \ntrafficking, in addition to other non-traditional \nsecurity issues such as climate change, nuclear \nsafety, energy, food and maritime security and \nfinancing for development are becoming more \nsignificant.\n\u201cThe use of chemical weapons in conflict poses \na renewed global security threat. There is therefore \na need for increased multilateral and collective \nengagement and responses to those complex \nchallenges.\n\u201cAs we all are aware, the target date for \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) is only two years away. While we \ntake stock of what have been achieved and the \nchallenges that continue to confront us, we should, \nin keeping with the principles set out in the United \nNations Conference on Sustainable Development \noutcome document, entitled \u2018The future we want\u2019 \n(resolution 66/288, annex), embark upon designing \na post-2015 development goals agenda in which the \nspecific needs and challenges of every Member \nStates are recognized. There is no doubt that failure \nto capture those specific needs and commitments \nwould compromise the credibility of such an \nagenda.\n\u201cWe also note that important progress has been \nmade in many areas, such as reducing poverty \nglobally, improving access to primary education for \nall children, reducing child and maternal mortality, \nincreasing access to HIV treatment and reducing \nslum populations, to name a few. However, this \nhas not been uniform, as inequalities among many \npopulations are on the rise, particularly in southern \nAsia and sub-Saharan Africa, where food insecurity \nand malnutrition are still prevalent. While access to \nhealth and education may be expanding for us, the \nquality of those services in many regions remains a \nserious challenge.\n\u201cThat is why the theme of this session, \u2018The \npost-2015 development agenda: setting the stage\u2019, \nis timely and appropriate. We are moving into \nthe phase of mapping out another development \nframework that is expected to formulate universal \ngoals and responsibilities encompassing the \neconomic, social and environmental spheres. The \npost-2015 development agenda should have at its \ncore the urgent need to address the causes and \nconsequences of conflict, violence and disasters. \nThese are universal issues of great concern to \nthe global community. Resolving and preventing \nconflict and violence, creating jobs, providing \nfurther incentives for foreign direct investment, \nbroadening human and financial resources, \nensuring gender equality and promoting human \nrights and the rule of law are not only fundamental \nto human progress; they are integral to sustainable \ndevelopment.\n\u201cSierra Leone welcomes the adoption of \nthe Arms Trade Treaty earlier this year. This \nis a significant and historic achievement in our \ncollective efforts in pursuit of a safer and more \nsecure world. We therefore hope that the illegal \ntransfer of conventional weapons to the wrong \nhands \u2014 a major source of the escalation of \nconflicts in the developing world, particularly \nin Africa \u2014 can now be largely regulated and \nminimized. \n\u201cIn that regard, we remain committed to \nsupporting international instruments aimed at \nestablishing peace and security in the world and an \neconomic order that is beneficial to the rich and the \npoor, the weak and the strong, as well as to nations \nbig and small.\n\u201cIn recent years, and despite being under post-\nconflict rebuilding, Sierra Leone\u2019s contribution \nto the United Nations peacekeeping efforts \ndemonstrates our strong commitment to the \npurpose and principles of global peace and stability. \nWe stand ready to increase our profile in the \n\f\npeacekeeping landscape so as to ensure the success \nof peacekeeping operations. To that end, we will \ncontinue to actively engage in all new initiatives \nfor reform of the United Nations peacekeeping \noperations.\n\u201cWe applaud and acknowledge the human \nresources and financial support that the United \nNations family and other development partners \ncontinue to provide, especially towards the \nsuccessful conduct of our 17 November 2012 \npresidential, parliamentary and local government \nelections, all of which were held in one day, for \nthe very first time. Those elections were widely \nconsidered to be a critical benchmark for us, \nsignalling our preparedness to move into a more \ndevelopmental phase of peacebuilding. It should \ncome as little or no surprise that they were widely \nacclaimed to be peaceful, free, fair and transparent \nby the international community. Their successful \nconduct clearly demonstrates the level that Sierra \nLeone\u2019s democratic process has attained, an \nexperience we are willing to share with other \ncountries in our subregion and beyond.\n\u201cToday, Sierra Leone is on the threshold \nof transformation in its engagement with the \nPeacebuilding Commission as well as in its \nsocioeconomic development. With support from the \nCommission and the Peacebuilding Support Office \nas well as other international and local development \npartners, Sierra Leone continues to make \nsignificant gains in the areas of good governance, \nhuman rights, gender equality and the fight against \ncorruption and transnational organized crime. A \nnumber of international treaties have been ratified \nand national legislations enacted to address these \nchallenges, which have the potential to undermine \nongoing peacebuilding and peace-consolidation \nefforts.\n\u201cSierra Leone\u2019s vision for transformative and \ninclusive socioeconomic development was initially \nencapsulated in my Government\u2019s poverty-\nreduction strategy, articulated in the \u2018Agenda for \nChange\u2019 that we rolled out in my first term of \noffice. These have been encouraging achievements \nand with residual challenges as well. In my current, \nsecond term, we are poised to build on those \nsuccesses with renewed determination. \n\u201cWith a sustained commitment to provide \nimproved standards of living for our people and \nto raise the country to middle-income status, we \nhave rolled those residual challenges over to our \nsuccessor development programme, the \u2018Agenda \nfor Prosperity\u2019, which I launched in July this year. \nThis is Sierra Leone\u2019s road map to our post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda. It aims to build a sustainable \nfuture for all Sierra Leoneans, requiring sound \nmacroeconomic management and fiscal policies for \na society with strong institutions to facilitate good \ngovernance, the social, economic and political \nempowerment of women and young people, the \nrequired social support for the disadvantaged, \nincreased transparency and accountability, and \njustice for all.\n\u201cIn taking up this huge challenge, Sierra Leone \nwill continue to welcome the strong partnership that \nexists with the various United Nations agencies and \nother international development partners for the \nachievement of a well-planned, seamless transition \nto a more developmental phase of peacebuilding \nand for scaling up support to Sierra Leone\u2019s \npolitical and economic priorities, as outlined in \nour \u2018Agenda for Prosperity\u2019. Sierra Leone, a nation \nwith good credentials as a post-conflict country, is \na deserving candidate for continued international \nsupport.\n\u201cSierra Leone continues to uphold its national \nheritage of interreligious tolerance and peaceful \ncoexistence, as well as the principle of respect for \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. In that \nregard, we remain focused on, and committed to, \nour reporting obligations to international treaty \nbodies. \n\u201cIn line with the relevant provisions of the \nDisability Act 2011, we have established a National \nCommission for Persons with Disability. The current \nand first Chairman and Chief Commissioner is a \nperson with impaired vision. We have also enacted \nthe Sexual Offences Act 2012 to address the specific \nissue of sexual violence against women and girls. \nSierra Leone will continue to collaborate with the \nUnited Nations and other interested partners in \npromoting the enactment of the Gender Equality \nBill so as to enhance women\u2019s participation in the \ndecision-making process.\n\u201cWe commend the support of the United \nNations and international partners for the work \nof the Special Court for Sierra Leone, whereby \nit has made meaningful contributions to the \n\f\nadvancement of the rule of law at both the national \nand international levels. With our continued \nsupport, the Special Court is expected to complete \nits mandate by the end of this year.\n\u201cWe are pleased to note that the Optional \nProtocol to the International Covenant on Economic, \nSocial and Cultural Rights entered into force in May \n2013. Sierra Leone pledges its continued support \nto the work of the Human Rights Council and the \nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner \nfor Human Rights as we strive together to maintain \nuniversally accepted standards of human rights and \ndemocratic governance.\n\u201cIt is in that context that we have also \nembarked upon a constitutional review process to \naddress major socioeconomic and political issues. \nA constitutional review committee has been \nestablished with a broad spectrum of membership, \ndrawn from all political parties, civil society, \nwomen, youth, disabled persons and even the \ndiaspora. The process will be inclusive and guided \nby a critical analysis in a broad national debate, with \nthe aim of strengthening democratic institutions and \npromoting national unity. We expect the committee \nto submit a draft review within two years.\n\u201cAs the coordinator of the African Union \ncommittee of 10 Heads of State on Security Council \nreforms, let me once again emphasize the need for \nurgent reform of the Council. The role of the United \nNations should be strengthened, not weakened. The \nneed for equitable geographical representation, with \nall the privileges of membership in the Security \nCouncil, cannot be overemphasized. Africa will \ntherefore continue to work closely with the relevant \nstakeholders and Member States, particularly other \nnon-permanent members of the Council, for an \nearly and decisive reform of that organ.\n\u201cLet me therefore reiterate that Africa\u2019s \nparticipation in the ongoing intergovernmental \nnegotiations is firmly rooted in our steadfast \ncommitment to the African common position \narticulated in the Ezulwini Consensus and Sirte \nDeclaration on the reform of the United Nations.\n\u201cThe Millennium Development Goals remain \na very lofty agenda in the history of our collective \nefforts for global socioeconomic development, \nalthough their full achievement has been thwarted \nby a multitude of factors. The year 2015 is a \ncritical one for the United Nations as it marks the \nOrganization\u2019s seventieth anniversary. It is also the \ntarget date for the MDGs and the tenth year since \nthe World Summit was held in 2005. \n\u201cWe are expected to agree on a post-2015 \ndevelopment framework. It is imperative that \nwe follow a pragmatic approach with renewed \nvigour and commitment to providing our people \nwith a future that guarantees justice, peace and \nsecurity, accountable and democratic governance, \na transparent and equitable distribution of wealth, \na safe and sustainable environment and health and \neducation for all. Those are all essential elements \nin setting the stage for the implementation of the \npost-2015 development agenda.\n\u201cLet me join the family of the United Nations \nin expressing our condolences and solidarity with \nthe people of Kenya, Pakistan and Nigeria for \nthe irreparable loss of valuable lives during the \nrecent terrorist attacks. Our thoughts and prayers \nare strongly and firmly with the families of the \ndeceased.\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I should like \nto extend my sincere congratulations to you, Sir, on \nyour election as President of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-eighth session. I assure you of the full \nsupport and cooperation of the Myanmar delegation. \nI am confident that your diplomatic skills and vast \nknowledge will guide our deliberations to a successful \nconclusion. I should also like to pay special tribute to \nyour predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremi., for a job well done \nin guiding the sixty-seventh session of the General \nAssembly.\n\nWe are fast approaching the deadline for the \nMillennium Development Goals. With fewer than \n850 days to go, there is now a sense of urgency to look \nback on our past journey and chart the way forward. \nDespite the laudable advances made in meeting several \nof the global Millennium Development Goal (MDG) \ntargets in the past 13 years, there remain inequality and \nvariations in achievement across regions and within \ncountries. Therefore, we need to intensify our efforts \nand accelerate actions towards the full realization of \nthe MDGs in the remaining short span of time.\n\nIn many developing countries, especially the least \ndeveloped ones, a large proportion of the population \nis still grappling with poverty, hunger, economic and \nsocial disparity, and environmental degradation. It \nis therefore most pertinent and timely for the United \nNations to set the post-2015 development agenda. For \nits part, Myanmar has been exerting relentless efforts to \nraise the socioeconomic conditions of its people, with \npoverty alleviation as the core priority of the national \neconomic strategy, commensurate with the MDGs.\n\nMy delegation adds its voice to that of the Group \nof 77 in calls to address the key implementation gaps \nof the MDGs and the poverty agenda over the next \ntwo years. In this regard, national efforts should be \nassisted by international support and an enabling \nenvironment. The role of the global partnership for \ndevelopment must also be strengthened. Achieving \ninclusive and sustainable development will be one of \nthe most paramount challenges of this century for the \nUnited Nations. Therefore my delegation welcomes the \nestablishment by the General Assembly of the High-\nLevel Political Forum on Sustainable Development.\n\nThis year, Myanmar celebrates the sixty-fourth \nanniversary of its membership in the family of the \nUnited Nations. We believe that the United Nations \nsystem remains relevant and important in the current \ninternational situation. In this age fraught with global \nchallenges, the United Nations is more essential than \n\n\n\f\never. We have trust in the world body\u2019s capacity and \ncapability to maintain international peace and security, \nto safeguard fundamental human rights, and to promote \neconomic and social development. Therefore, Myanmar \nhas always cooperated with the United Nations in good \nfaith.\n\nAs cooperation with the United Nations is the \ncornerstone of our foreign policy, we have always \nstrictly abided by the decisions and resolutions of the \nUnited Nations. We believe that the United Nations \nshould be more democratic, representative and effective \nin order to face the security and economic challenges in \nmany parts of the world.\n\nThe continued existence of weapons of mass \ndestruction, particularly nuclear weapons, poses the \ngreatest threat to humankind. Myanmar is therefore \nactively pursuing the cause of nuclear disarmament \nand nuclear non-proliferation in international forums. \nOne testimony of our aspiration is demonstrated by \nthe annual resolution on nuclear disarmament that \nour delegation has submitted since 1995. Through \nthat resolution we have been calling on nuclear-\nweapon States to cease immediately the qualitative \nimprovement, development, production and stockpiling \nof nuclear weapons with a view to taking measures \nleading to their total elimination within a specified \nframework of time.\n\nIn that firm belief, the Government of Myanmar \nsigned the additional protocol to the International \nAtomic Energy Agency safeguards agreement on the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \non 17 September. That is yet another significant \ndevelopment testifying to our commitment to the goals \nof nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation.\n\nMyanmar fully subscribes to the fundamental \nprinciple of the peaceful settlement of disputes as \nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. \nAccordingly, Myanmar has been contributing its fair \nshare to regional and international peace and security.\n\nOn the domestic front, the Government of \nPresident U Thein Sein has been undertaking \nunprecedented wide-ranging political and economic \nreforms over the past two and a half years. The \nGovernment has dedicated its efforts to fulfilling the \ntwin objectives inspired by the people: to establish \npeace, stability and the rule of law, and to advance \nsocioeconomic development of the lives of the people.\n\nThe first component of the reform was political \ntransformation. The objective was to bring about \npeace, stability, national unity and reconciliation. Now \nwe have been able to establish a firm foundation for \nbuilding a democratic society. Political space has been \ncreated for every stakeholder, and the all-inclusive \npolitical system is in place. The legislative bodies are \nalso functioning well, in an active and vibrant manner. \nNumerous pieces of legislation have been enacted to the \nbenefit of the people, including new laws permitting \ngreater freedom of the press, speech and association. A \nseries of amnesties have been granted which have set \nfree thousands of prisoners. We are speedily working \nthrough a screening mechanism to ensure that no \nprisoner of conscience will remain in prison by the end \nof the year.\n\nThe emergence of civil societies has also contributed \nto strengthening democratic values and practices. We \nhave now been able to nurture a new culture of dialogue \nand accommodation among people of differing views \nand beliefs. We are also taking steps to establish the \nrule of law, good governance and clean government.\n\nWe have also made tangible progress in our efforts \ntowards national reconciliation. The Government\u2019s \npeace overtures have led to ceasefire agreements with \nall armed groups, for the first time in more than 60 years. \nWe hope that we will be able to celebrate the signing of \na nationwide ceasefire agreement in Nay Pyi Taw very \nsoon. We are optimistic that we will be able to start \na new round of political dialogue at the Union central \nlevel in the near future to strike a comprehensive and \nlasting peace agreement. We have no illusion that the \nnext step will be easy, but we are determined to pursue \nthis path for the sake of our people, as they have for so \nlong deserved.\n\nThe hard-won peace and the success of the \ndemocratic transformation will not be realistic or \nsustainable until and unless we deliver on the economic \nand social needs of the people. Therefore, as the \nsecond component of reform, we have opened up the \neconomy through economic liberalization, financial \nreform, inviting foreign investment, a people-centred \ndevelopment approach, rural development, poverty \nalleviation and equitable development. We have \nalso created an investor-friendly environment. The \nGovernment is focusing on poverty alleviation and rural \ndevelopment. We have aimed at reducing the current \npoverty rate from 26 per cent to 16 per cent by 2015, as \nprescribed in the Millennium Development Goals.\n\n\n\f\nRecently, the Government turned its focus to \nprivate-sector development as another wave of reform. \nAt this stage, the Government is strongly emphasizing \nthe improvement of the institutional infrastructure and \nregulatory framework so as to facilitate business, trade \nand investment.\n\nWe are truly grateful to the international community \nfor its invaluable support and encouragement in our \ndemocratic transition as well as in our efforts for the \nsocioeconomic development of the people of Myanmar. \nWe welcome responsible trade and investment that will \ntransfer technology to develop our economy, to create \njobs and to lift our people from poverty. We are now \ntaking the necessary steps to become a signatory to the \nExtractive Industries Transparency Initiative. We will \ntry our best to ensure that no one from the communities \nor our national ethnic groups will be left behind and \nexcluded from enjoying the fruits of our reforms and \nthe exciting life of the nation.\n\nMyanmar is a multiracial and multifaith nation. \nVarious ethnic populations with the world\u2019s four \ngreat religions \u2014 Buddhists, Christians, Muslims \nand Hindus \u2014 have been living side by side in peace \nand harmony as fellow citizens of Myanmar. The \nConstitution of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar \nalso designates the four religions as officially recognized \nfaiths of the country. There are always people who wish \nto rock the boat. We will not let anyone take advantage \nof political openness to instigate violence among the \ndifferent ethnic or religious communities. President \nU Thein Sein has clearly stated that the Government \nwill take a zero-tolerance approach to anyone fuelling \nethnic hatred.\n\nThe Government has been making serious \nefforts to resolve the problem through short-term \nand long-term plans. These include our extensive \nefforts, in cooperation with the United Nations and \nhumanitarian non-governmental organizations, to \nimprove the living conditions and livelihoods of all \naffected peoples, without discrimination. Parallel with \nthese efforts, the Government is also encouraging \ninterfaith dialogues across the country with a view to \npromoting understanding and trust among the different \ncommunities. In addition, the National Human \nRights Commission, an independent human rights \nbody of Myanmar, has also been working closely and \nintensively with domestic civil society organizations, \ninterfaith groups and regional and international human \nrights bodies for the promotion and protection of human \nrights in the country.\n\nOur reform process is still nascent and at a \nsensitive stage where there is little room for error. With \nthis in mind, the President has publicly emphasized \nthe need for everyone to refrain from doing anything \nthat could jeopardize Myanmar\u2019s peaceful transition. \nWhile undertaking political and other reform processes \ndomestically, we have also been able to reach out to the \ninternational community. The overwhelming support \nthat we have received from the international community \nand the United Nations has contributed significantly to \nthe transition efforts in the country.\n\nMyanmar is ready to take over the chairmanship of \nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \nin 2014 for the very first time since the country joined \nthe Organization in 1997. We regard this opportunity \nas a great honour. We shall be working closely with our \nfellow ASEAN members and with ASEAN dialogue \npartners in discharging this important responsibility so \nas to move forward in unity to a peaceful and prosperous \ncommunity.\n\nIn the process of Myanmar\u2019s transition to \ndemocracy, expectations are high within the country \nas well as in the international community. For the \nGovernment and the people of Myanmar, the task is \ndaunting. There are many challenges ahead. We are still \nin a critical transition period. However, we are resolute \nin marching forward along our chosen path. There will \nbe no turning back. But we will not take anything for \ngranted. It is incumbent upon the Government and \npeople of Myanmar to be vigilant at all times so that we \ndo not fall into the trap of the detractors of the reform \nprocess.\n\nWe need the continued support and encouragement \nof the international community. We always welcome \nfriendly and constructive advice and the helping \nhands of friends far and near in our nation-building \nprocess. However, we are fully cognizant of the fact \nthat ultimately the people Myanmar themselves are \nresponsible for deciding their own destiny and shaping \ntheir own future.\n\nThe Government of President U Thein Sein is \nlaying a solid foundation for democracy, peace and \ndevelopment for the people of Myanmar. Observers \nhave applauded Myanmar\u2019s transition to democracy as \none of the most promising efforts of democratization in \nthe world today. The success we have achieved so far on \n\n\n\f\nthe road to democracy has been made possible through \nthe joint efforts of the leadership and the people of \nMyanmar, driven by a strong and genuine desire to \nchange.\n\nThe road ahead is long and full of challenges. We \nwill spare no effort to overcome any challenges and \nmove ahead on the journey on which we have set out to \nbuild a nation of peace, democracy and prosperity. As \nwe continue our journey we need the understanding, \ncontinued encouragement and support of the United \nNations and the international community. We will \nnever lose sight of our goals, and we are determined to \nfulfil the aspirations of the people of Myanmar.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, \nI would like, on behalf of the Head of State, the Head of \nGovernment and the people of Togo, to congratulate the \nGeneral Assembly on the occasion of its sixty-eighth \nsession. I wish to warmly congratulate you, Sir, on your \nel..ti.n to the presidency of the General Assembly \nand to assure you of Togo\u2019s full willingness to support \nyour actions throughout your mandate. I also take this \nopportunity to pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon, who continues to take bold initiatives to \nenable the Organization to effectively fulfil its mandate \nin promoting peace and sustainable development.\n\nThe theme that you have chosen for the sixty-eighth \nsession, \u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: setting \nthe stage\u201d, is indicative of the particular attention that \nthe countries of the South give to development issues. \nAt the same time, it is an invitation to the United \nNations not only to keep sight of that concern, but also \nto implement a sustainable development programme for \nall countries. The Millennium Declaration (resolution \n55/2) set forth specific Goals that each country should \nattain by 2015 in order to usher in a world in which \nevery individual can live in dignity. On the eve of that \ndeadline, it is appropriate to reflect on the progress \nmade since the Millennium Summit and to discuss \nnew prospects for shoring up the progress that has \nbeen achieved in combating hunger, malnutrition and \ndisease.\n\nThe United Nations has the primary responsibility \nfor the maintenance of international peace and security. \nHowever, those objectives can be sustainably achieved \nonly if abject poverty does not become a breeding \nground for all sorts of societal ills. That is why, when \nwe embark on a collective discussion of what should \nhappen post-2015, we must think above all about ways \nto increase the economic and social development and \nprosperity of nations and to prevent conflicts before \nthey even occur. That applies to all countries, but \nparticularly to African nations that have been weakened \nby recurrent crises and are now facing various threats.\n\nMore than a decade after the launch of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), when \nefforts have been made to achieve the Goals, it is \nclear, as the deadline of 2015 approaches, that many \nchallenges remain, in particular for developing \ncountries. For those countries continue to experience \nthe impacts of the financial, energy and food crises \nof previous years, given their economies\u2019 dependence \non external sources \u2014 crises that unfortunately have \nbeen exacerbated by climate change. The net result is \nto reduce their chances of achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals within the set time frame.\n\nMoreover, the various initiatives and commitments \nundertaken by the leaders of this world in the context \nof the great international forums are far from achieving \nthe desired results. The arrival of official development \nassistance in pledged proportions has been delayed. That \nis the reason why, at the United Nations Conference on \nSustainable Development, the international community \nwas called upon to uphold its commitments, in \nparticular those made in the Millennium Declaration, \nthe Monterrey Consensus, the Johannesburg Plan of \nImplementation and the United Nations declarations on \nthe New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development.\n\nAt the same time, the Heads of State and \nGovernment reiterated the need for their States to adjust \n\n\n\f\ntheir policies in order to further integrate economic, \nsocial and environmental factors at all levels and across \nall disciplines, to ensure sustainable development \nacross the board. And indeed, to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment, there must be, at the national and \ninternational levels, conditions conducive to continuing \nand strengthening international cooperation in areas \nsuch as debt, trade, technology transfer, innovation and \nentrepreneurship and capacity-building .\n\nAchieving the MDGs is one of the Togolese \nGovernment\u2019s priorities. Enormous efforts have been \nmade to significantly reduce poverty in the country. In \nthe field of education, the introduction of free primary \neducation since 2008 has encouraged an increase in \nschool enrolment, especially among young girls.\n\nWith regard to health issues, the HIV/AIDS \nprevalence rate has been reduced by half. The care \nof infected people has improved considerably, and \nmore than 26,000 patients are cared for by the State. \nThe integrated programme providing vaccination, the \ndistribution of insecticide-treated mosquito nets and \nimproved nutrition has yielded promising results in the \narea of maternal and child health.\n\nIn addition, significant progress has been made \nin other areas of development, including agriculture, \nwhich, thanks to a far-reaching and ambitious national \nagricultural investment programme and food security, \nhas contributed to reducing poverty, hunger and food \ninsecurity.\n\nThe progress achieved by Togo received recognition \nfrom the Food and Agriculture Organization of the \nUnited Nations (FAO) in the form of an award made \nby that Organization during the thirty-eighth FAO \nConference in June in Rome.\n\nOn the social front, for some years now the \nGovernment of Togo has been taking proactive measures \nenabling us to tackle in a sustained way the problems of \njoblessness and underemployment among young people \nand their marginalization in decision-making. Among \nthem I can point to a national youth council, a national \nvolunteer programme, the creation of a support fund for \nyouth economic initiatives and a support programme \nfor the integration and development of employment \nopportunities.\n\nThe Government of Togo, aware of the great \nchallenges of the twenty-first century, is continuing to \nwork with faith and determination to gradually build \na democratic society capable of guaranteeing to every \ncitizen, without exception, the peace, harmony, well-\nbeing, justice and freedom that are prerequisites for our \nsociety\u2019s full flourishing and that must go hand in hand \nwith our economic and social development goals.\n\nFor nearly a decade, the Government of Togo \nhas adopted a policy of dialogue and consensus in \nmanaging State affairs. It is in that context that it has \ncontinued to urge the country\u2019s political class to engage \nin dialogue in order to ensure that election processes are \ndefinitively free of violence and that the new cycle of \npeaceful political life becomes more solidly entrenched. \nThus, in addition to the reshuffling that has taken place \nsince May 2012, following the recommendations of the \nelectoral observation missions, particularly that of the \nEuropean Union, new measures have been adopted. \nThey have to do with the reorganization of the national \nindependent electoral commission, the new electoral \ncode and laws on electoral districting, the financing \nof political parties and the status of the opposition. \nThose measures enabled us to hold free, democratic, \ntransparent and calm elections to the legislature on \n25 July.\n\nThis is the moment for me to thank all the partners \nwho supported my country throughout the process, as \nwell as the various observation missions, which, on the \ncompletion of their work, expressed their satisfaction \nwith the good conduct of the elections. The new \nParliament that emerged from the elections will continue \nwith the institutional and constitutional reforms \nstipulated in the global political agreement signed in \nLom\u00e9 in August 2006 between the Government and the \npolitical parties, in order to ensure that Togo will finally \npossess an institutional framework that strengthens \ndemocracy and the rule of law and consolidates our \neconomic and social gains. Similarly, the Government \nelected in the legislative elections of 25 July has been \ngiven the primary mandate of stepping up its work in \npriority social areas such as health, education, access \nto safe drinking water and sanitation, and youth \nemployment.\n\nThat road map keeps the 2015 deadline in view as \nit seeks first and foremost to continue Togo\u2019s efforts \nto meet the Millennium Development Goals in the \nestablished time frame. Our new frame of reference \nfor development in the medium term, the strategy \nfor accelerated growth and job promotion, reflects \nthat determination to focus squarely on the MDGs. \nTogo is fully aware that effective achievement of the \n\n\n\f\nMDGs requires resources. That is why we are actively \ncommitted to promoting good governance.\n\nUnder that heading fall our strategic plan for \nmobilizing the Togolese diaspora, our accession to \nthe Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, \nthe establishment of a regulatory authority for public \ncontracts in order to improve the business climate, \nthe restructuring of public enterprises and the finance \nsector and especially the establishment of a revenue \noffice responsible for the collection of both customs \nand tax receipts. None of this progress and success \nwould have been possible for Togo without the support \nof our development partners, whom we would like to \nthank once again, and to whom we turn for increased \nsupport within the framework of the partnerships that \nbind us together.\n\nTogo remains deeply convinced that our efforts to \nmeet the targets we set ourselves through the MDGs \ncannot succeed in isolation. While every State has its \nown challenges, the international community must \ncommit to working on them collectively, owing to the \ninterdependence that is the hallmark of today\u2019s world. \nIn the face of accelerating global change, worsening \ninsecurity and the urgency of finding a collective \nsolution to the challenges our Organization is dealing \nwith, I can assure the Assembly that Togo remains \ncommitted to seeking a vision of a united, integrated \nworld where every State must cooperate to promote \npeaceful coexistence and good neighbourliness and to \ncombat poverty and underdevelopment in all its forms, \nas well as political, ideological, ethnic and religious \nintolerance.\n\nHere I would like to touch on the case of Mali, where \nthe danger represented by terrorist groups and extremist \njihadists, coupled with a serious humanitarian crisis, \nprompted the United Nations to action with a speedy \nmilitary intervention and peacekeeping operation. In \nthat regard, the adoption of an integrated United Nations \nstrategy for the Sahel, in the months after Security \nCouncil resolution 2100 (2013) established the United \nNations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization \nMission in Mali (MINUSMA), has been crucial. The \nholding of the presidential elections on 28 July and \n3 August was an unquestionable success not only for \nthe Malian people and their leaders but also for the \ninternational community.\n\nTogo is pleased that regional and subregional \norganizations, along with the international community, \nwere able to speak with one voice and coordinate their \nactions in order to achieve the results we welcome \ntoday. From this rostrum, Togo, which is currently \nchairing the West African Economic and Monetary \nUnion, of which Mali is a member, would like to \nreiterate the community\u2019s pleasure at this success of \nthe highly diverse Malian people, who demonstrated \ntheir political maturity and the ability to overcome their \ndifferences in the national interest.\n\nIn accordance with its ongoing commitment to \npeace, security and stability, internationally and in the \nWest African subregion in particular, Togo continues \nto work within the entities and institutions of which it \nis a member and, through its MINUSMA contingent, \nto contribute to helping the Government of Mali. That \nis why my country invites the community of nations to \ncontinue to support Mali on the road to rebuilding both \nthe infrastructure that was destroyed in the north of \nthe country and its economic development, which was \nseverely damaged in the crisis.\n\nThere are other situations in Africa that deserve our \nclose attention by reason of the degree to which they \ncontribute to the continent\u2019s insecurity and undermine \nour efforts to achieve the MDGs. The Central African \nRepublic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \nLibya and many other countries are currently sources \nof concern, since peace and security are still tenuous \nin those brotherly countries. While we commend the \nbold actions that have already been taken to halt those \nconflicts, we would like to urge the international \ncommunity to continue to work to that end alongside \nthe African Union, which has made extraordinary \nefforts to overcome all the obstacles to the continent\u2019s \neconomic rebirth.\n\nAmong the scourges that have the potential to slow \nAfrican States\u2019 development is that of transnational \norganized crime, whose pernicious impact on our \neconomies is clear. Where the States of the Gulf of \nGuinea are concerned, piracy and armed robbery \non the high seas have recently become a new type of \nscourge that is more and more worrying and whose \nseriousness demands general involvement and a strong, \nfirm and uncompromising response on the part of the \ninternational community as a whole, as well as the \ncountries concerned.\n\nIn that regard, my country, which is currently \na member of the Security Council, welcomes the \ncommitment whereby the Council has included the \nissue in its agenda, on the initiative of our States. The \nCouncil\u2019s position has enabled the United Nations \n\n\n\f\nOffice for Central Africa and the United Nations Office \nfor West Africa to be a strong presence in the quest for \nsolutions to the problem, through the Summit of Heads \nof State and Government of the Economic Community \nof Central African States and the Economic Community \nof West African States on maritime safety and security.\n\nThe summit that was held in Yaound\u00e9 on 24 and \n25 June led to the adoption of a code of conduct for the \nprevention and suppression of acts of piracy and armed \nrobbery against ships and illegal maritime activities. \nThe fight against those scourges calls for enhanced \ninternational cooperation, in particular among United \nNations and regional and subregional organizations, in \nline with the Charter of the United Nations. However, \nregional and subregional organizations will not be able \nto effectively tackle those current major challenges if \nthey are not granted substantial resources.\n\nThe Syrian conflict continues with its atrocities \nand daily tragedies, which culminated in the use of \nchemical weapons on 21 August. The international \ncommunity has long stood by, powerless, as the conflict \nhas taken its gruesome toll. However, we express the \nhope that Security Council resolution 2118 (2013) \nwill open up promising new prospects for peace and \nan inclusive political transition in Syria. That means \nthat the international community must do more on the \nhumanitarian front by providing aid to Syrians in need, \nboth inside and outside the country. In that regard, \nwe ardently hope that the holding of the \u201cGeneva II\u201d \nconference will provide an opportunity for ending \nthe crisis through the establishment of a transitional \nGovernment based on consensus and an inclusive \nprocess.\n\nI cannot fail to mention the Israeli-Palestinian \nconflict by welcoming the resumption of direct \nnegotiations between the two parties, thanks to the \nsustained efforts of President Barack Obama. Togo calls \non the Israeli and Palestinian authorities to negotiate in \ngood faith to reach, in the shortest possible time, an \nagreement that finally allows for the creation of two \nStates living side by side in peace and security and \nwithin internationally recognized borders.\n\nThe challenges facing our States are numerous \nand vast, but we believe in the ability of the United \nNations to deal with them. It is therefore important that \nwe re-establish the United Nations on the basis of the \nvalues that led to its creation, which are, essentially, the \nmaintenance of international peace and security and \nthe strengthening of international cooperation.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize, with \nregard to the MDGs, the need to stay the course, \nregardless of the results achieved by each individual \nState. Better yet, the international community must be \nmore ambitious in the goals that it will establish for \nthe post-2015 period, because, given the challenges of \nthe contemporary world, it is no longer simply a matter \nof reducing the proportion of persons suffering from \nhunger, malnutrition and endemic diseases. Our aim \nmust be to eradicate them. Only by mobilizing all our \nefforts in the pursuit of those very important goals will \nwe increase our chances of actually achieving them.\n"

        "file_text": "This year, we \ncelebrate the centennial of the Peace Palace in The \nHague, seat of the International Court of Justice (ICC) \nand the Permanent Court of Arbitration, and symbol of \nthe pursuit of peace by means of law. Next year, we will \ncommemorate the centennial of the first of two suicidal \nworld wars that caused unspeakable human suffering, \nhorrible crimes against humanity and the oppression of \nhalf of Europe\u2019s population until the Berlin wall came \ndown in 1989.\n\nOut of the ashes of those global conflagrations \ngrew the desire of the peoples of the world to put an end \nto violent conflict and to guarantee human rights for \nevery human being in every country. \u201cNever again\u201d is \nwhat humankind wanted. Unfortunately, so far it is not \nwhat we have been able to deliver to everyone.\n\nDuring the festive celebrations this year in The \nHague, which gave fresh impetus to the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes, there were scenes of unspeakable \nviolence in Syria, including the use of chemical \nweapons. More recently, in Nairobi, dozens of people \nwere killed by terrorists. One of the victims was Dr. \nElif Yavuz, a young Dutch woman who was eight \nmonths pregnant with her first baby. My heart goes out \nto Dr. Yavuz\u2019s family, to all the victims of the Nairobi \nattack and to their loved ones.\n\nThe powerlessness of the international community \nto put an end to abuses like those has led in the past \nto the establishment of new bodies and instruments. \nAfter the Second World War, the United Nations was \nfounded and the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights was adopted. Following more recent genocides, \nthe International Criminal Court was established. The \nuse of chemical weapons by Saddam Hussein led to the \nChemical Weapons Convention and the Organization \nfor the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). \nSo the institutions and instruments are in place. The \nquestion is, what is preventing them from delivering \nresults? Perhaps the answer to the question was given \nalready four centuries ago by Dutch philosopher Baruch \nSpinoza when he wrote: \u201cPeace is not an absence of \n\n\n\f\nwar; it is a virtue, a state of mind, a disposition for \nbenevolence, confidence, justice\u201d.\n\nIt is my conviction that the international community \nmust keep working on the project we launched a hundred \nyears ago. We should follow the example of Dr. Yavuz, \nwho was committed to helping people suffering from \nHIV/AIDS and malaria. We should work to achieve \nher aims and uphold her ideals. We should make clear \nthat terrorism will never triumph. We should invest in \nthe United Nations and support it as effectively as we \ncan. We strongly support the Secretary-General and \nthe message he delivered here on Tuesday (A/68/PV.5). \nWe will join him on the road to peace, justice and \ndevelopment.\n\nThe Netherlands advocates a coherent agenda for \nstrengthening the international legal order. A peaceful \nworld demands a sustainable legal order and a powerful \nagenda for development. It demands a strategy for \ndisarmament and a focus on human rights. Those are \nthe principles of the foreign policy of the Netherlands. \nA partnership for peace, justice and development is the \ncornerstone of the Dutch candidacy for a non-permanent \nseat in the Security Council in 2017-2018.\n\nThe world was shocked to discover that an attack \nwith chemical weapons had taken place in Syria \non 21 August. The attack violated one of the most \nimportant peremptory norms of international law. The \n1925 Geneva Protocol, to which Syria is a party, bans \nthe use of chemical weapons. The situation in Syria \nposes a clear threat to international peace and security. \nThe Netherlands calls on the Security Council to take \nconcerted action to address that threat. We have just \nheard from the representative of Australia what is going \nto happen today.\n\nSyria does not comply with the international \nnorm that requires it to protect its citizens. But the \ninternational community also has a responsibility. \nThe Netherlands supports the proposal that permanent \nSecurity Council members should henceforth refrain \nfrom using their veto power in votes on intervention \nto stop the mass atrocity crimes identified by the \n2005 World Summit. They should show that they are \nserious about their responsibility to protect vulnerable \npopulations, underlining our consensus that genocide, \nwar crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic \ncleansing must never be tolerated.\n\nAs the Secretary-General said, those responsible \nfor the atrocities in Syria should be held accountable in \naccordance with international law. The use of chemical \nweapons is a war crime under the Rome Statute. If the \nSyrian Government itself sees no possibility of tracking \ndown and prosecuting the guilty parties, it can ask the \nICC to do so. If Syria makes no request, the Security \nCouncil must take action. Finally, as the Secretary-\nGeneral also said, we can hardly be satisfied with the \ndestruction of chemical weapons while the wider war \ncontinues to destroy Syria and kill innocent people. A \npeaceful solution is needed. And the women of Syria \nshould be involved in making that happen, as there can \nbe no solution without them.\n\nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women, \npeace and security provides an outstanding tool for \npromoting inclusive conflict resolution. This week we \nhosted a side event marking the importance of women\u2019s \npolitical participation for successful transitions in the \nMiddle East and North Africa. The Executive Director \nof UN-Women told me earlier this week that courage \nis every woman\u2019s middle name. It certainly is in Syria.\n\nThe Netherlands supports John Kerry\u2019s efforts to \nencourage Israel and the Palestinian Authority to arrive \nat a two-State solution through direct negotiations. The \ninternational community should support the Israeli-\nPalestinian talks. Only a political solution can lead to \nlasting peace.\n\nFifty years ago, United States President John F. \nKennedy expressed the fear that in the 1970s there \nwould be 15, 20 or even 25 nuclear-weapon States. \nThanks in part to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \nof Nuclear Weapons, that danger was averted, but the \nrisk of further proliferation of nuclear weapons has not \nreceded. While much has been achieved in the field \nof disarmament, there is still a long way to go. In his \nspeech in Berlin in June, President Obama warned of \nthe danger of nuclear weapons. \u201cAs long as nuclear \nweapons exist, we are not truly safe\u201d, he said \u2014 and he \nis right. He plans to take new steps to reduce strategic \nnuclear arsenals. He also wants to make substantial \nreductions in the number of United States and Russian \nnon-strategic weapons in Europe. The Netherlands is in \nfavour of those steps, strongly supports the efforts and \nwants to contribute to them.\n\nIn March of next year, the Nuclear Security Summit \nwill convene in The Hague. My country\u2019s hosting of the \nSummit is in keeping with our tradition as a country of \n\n\n\f\npeace, justice and security. Nuclear materials can play \nan important role in curing our illnesses and heating \nour homes. And fortunately, the likelihood of terrorists \nusing nuclear materials in an attack is small. But if it \ndid happen, the consequences for the world would be \nvery serious indeed.\n\nThe Nuclear Security Summit is meant to give \nfresh impetus to global efforts to ensure nuclear \nsecurity and prevent nuclear terrorism by making and \nimplementing agreements at the highest multilateral \nlevel. Governments, businesses, researchers and \norganizations from many countries are working \ntogether to reduce the quantities of nuclear materials, \nto enhance the security of the materials that remain, \nand to combat nuclear smuggling.\n\nThe centennial of the Peace Palace is a good \noccasion to highlight the peaceful settlement of \ndisputes. The Netherlands has used the celebrations \nto strengthen instruments for peaceful settlement. We \nadvocate taking three interrelated steps.\n\nFirst, we need to encourage countries to recognize \nthe compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court \nof Justice. As States Members of the United Nations, \nwe recognize the Court as a principal organ of the \nUnited Nations. In my view, recognizing its compulsory \njurisdiction is a logical and necessary next step. \nSecondly, we must help countries realize how useful \nand flexible arbitration is as a way of settling disputes. \nThe Security Council and the General Assembly could \ndraw parties\u2019 attention to that instrument more often \nand we should advocate it more often in the public \ndebate. Thirdly, we must reduce the obstacles to the \npeaceful settlement of disputes by making alternatives \navailable. This is why the Netherlands enthusiastically \nsupports the Department of Political Affairs and \nnon-governmental organization that promote mediation.\n\nIn his 2011 report on the responsibility to protect \n(A/65/877), the Secretary-General rightly pointed \nout the importance of mediation as a means of \npreventing atrocity crimes. National legal systems \nare the foundation of the international legal order. \nStrengthening national legal systems should make it \npossible to keep the courtrooms of the International \nCriminal Court closed.\n\nThe ICC is inextricably linked to the global chain \nof legal institutions. It delivers justice in the wake of \ninternational crimes, thus helping to prevent future \noffences. So it is crucial that countries continue to \naccede to the Rome Statute and that popular support \nfor it be maintained. We need to ensure that countries \nthat have acceded to the Statute continue to work with \nthe ICC.\n\nThis year marks the sixty-fifth anniversary of \nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the \ntwentieth anniversary of the Vienna Declaration. \nThe Universal Declaration is an enduring source of \ninspiration. It was adopted without a single dissenting \nvote under the inspired leadership of Eleanor Roosevelt, \nwho acted as a change agent before the expression \nwas coined. Just before the vote she said, \u201cWe stand \ntoday at the threshold of a great event both in the life \nof the United Nations and in the life of mankind\u201d (see \nA/PV.180).\n\nThe World Conference on Human Rights in \nVienna underlined that human rights are universal, \nindivisible, interdependent and interrelated. Twenty \nyears after Vienna, the blueprints of our human rights \ninfrastructure are complete. Now it is time to ensure \nthe necessary implementation, political will, capacity, \nfinancial resources and treaty body reforms. To that \nend, Dutch human rights policy stresses the importance \nof forging trilateral partnerships in different regions \nof the world. We focus on protecting human rights \ndefenders and promoting LGBT and women\u2019s rights.\n\nWithout development, there can be no global \npeace and security. We are fast approaching 2015, \nand have made great progress. In the next two years \nwe can still make a difference and advance towards \nthe Millennium Development Goals. The post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda will also benefit from a single, \nunified framework. We cannot talk about the plight \nof the world\u2019s poorest people in isolation from the \nenvironmental problems endangering life on our planet. \nIt is crucial to ensure that development is sustainable so \nthat we can balance and integrate its economic, social \nand ecological dimensions. Peace, security and the rule \nof law constitute a fourth vital element of sustainable \ndevelopment.\n\nThe key words for the post-2015 development \nagenda are better aid, more trade and stronger policy \ncoherence for sustainable development. Also, we \nneed to promote women\u2019s rights. That includes sexual \nand reproductive health and rights, as well as equal \nopportunity. I have four children \u2014 two of them are \ngirls. It would be unbearable for me, as a parent, if they \ndid not have equal opportunity as their brothers.\n\n\n\f\nIt goes without saying that a nation that was built \nby claiming its lands from the sea is concerned when \nrising sea levels might endanger that claim. Therefore, \nwe feel a strong solidarity with other countries that are \nthreatened in the same way. The Netherlands wants to \nstrengthen the synergy between climate and poverty-\nreduction policies, particularly in the field of water and \nfood security.\n\nExactly 75 years ago today, British Prime Minister \nChamberlain said, in a radio address on the Sudetenland \ncrisis,\n\n\u201cHow horrible, fantastic, incredible it is that we \nshould be digging trenches and trying on gas-masks \nhere because of a quarrel in a far away country \nbetween people of whom we know nothing.\u201d\nCzechoslovakia was dismembered shortly afterwards. \nThat was not just the fault of the signatories of \nthe Munich Agreement. The entire international \ncommunity \u2014 especially Czechoslovakia\u2019s fellow \ndemocracies in Europe, including my own country, the \nNetherlands \u2014 looked the other way.\nToday we can no longer pretend to know nothing of \nquarrels in faraway countries or of the people who live \nthere. If we fail, it is not because of the deficiency of the \nlegal instruments that we have developed. It is because \nof the international community\u2019s deficient sense of \nresponsibility. It is our duty to take responsibility in \naddressing the crisis in Syria.\n\nThe Secretary-General talked earlier this week \nabout leadership and identified Nelson Mandela as a \nshining example. I wish we would all listen to \u201cMadiba\u201d \nmore often. On Syria, we should follow the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s lead and make peace and justice a reality.\n\nInvesting in the United Nations is an investment \nin our common future. We are shareholders with a \nlong-term interest. We need to have the instruments for \npeace, justice and development ready for the moment \nthat they can help avert catastrophe. That is why we \ninvested in the Organization for the Prohibition of \nChemical Weapons, which has now proved crucial in \nthe Syrian crisis. That is why we should invest in the \nlegitimacy and effectiveness of the Security Council. \nThat is why we should work as hard as we can to come \nup with a clear and ambitious post-2015 sustainable \ndevelopment agenda. We are all in this together; we \nshould invest together in our United Nations.\n\n"

        "file_text": "As a freshly minted Foreign \nMinister, I am delighted to take part in this general \ndebate. Only a few weeks ago, Australia held national \nelections and chose a new Government. Only nine \ndays ago, I was sworn in as Australia\u2019s thirty-eighth \nMinister for Foreign Affairs. A change of Government \nis a significant national decision. It has happened only \nseven times in our country since the Second World War.\n\nAustralia is an open, liberal democracy. We \nrecognize our good fortune in having an unbroken \nrecord of peaceful democratic transition stretching \nback to 1901. The United Nations offers that same ideal \nof peace and order in relations among States. It gives us \na place to resolve our differences and to be heard on the \nconcerns that matter most.\n\nThere is an intrinsic connection between the \nsecurity and stability of Governments and economic \ndevelopment. Good Governments understand that \nproviding a secure and stable environment for their \ncitizens is their most fundamental task, but that task \nis tied inextricably to the strength of their economy. \nEconomic growth, development and trade are the key \ndrivers of national and international prosperity, and a \nvital support for global security. That is why the new \nAustralian Government will put economic diplomacy \nat the centre of our foreign policy.\n\nWe will promote responsible economic governance \nand open trading systems that support export-oriented \neconomies. We recognize that a strong business sector, \nopen trading rules and liberal foreign investment policies \ncan foster economic growth and, with it, opportunities \nto achieve prosperity and security. Strong economies \ngive nations and their people an environment in which \nto build their lives \u2014 to make choices for the lives they \nwant to lead. Strong, open economies foster sustainable \ngrowth. We understand that from our experience in \nAustralia and in our region.\n\nAustralia\u2019s economic success and high standards \nof living are anchored in reform efforts over many \nyears. We liberalized our economy and unilaterally \ndismantled trade barriers and protectionist policies. In \nour own region, as economies have opened, standards of \nliving have improved. We have witnessed the enormous \ngrowth of the middle class in South-East Asia. Estimates \nsuggest that approximately 145 million people will be \nconsidered middle-class in 2015, up from 95 million in \n2010. In Asia more broadly, we expect a middle class \nof over 3 billion people by 2030. Indonesia, currently \nthe world\u2019s sixteenth-largest economy, is on track to be \nthe world\u2019s seventh-largest economy by 2030. China \nand India are projected to become the largest and third \n-largest economies by 2030. Over 290 million people in \nChina were lifted out of poverty in the decade between \n1999 and 2009.\n\nThe Secretary-General has rightly focused our \nattention this week on the needs of the poor, the \ncommitment we made to them over a decade ago, and \nour vision for the future. We need to finish the job on \nthe Millennium Development Goals. Beyond 2015, we \nmust prioritize sustainable economic growth in the \nglobal development framework. We must provide the \nopportunity for all people, including people with a \ndisability, to lead healthy and productive lives, leaving \nno one behind. We must support women\u2019s economic \nparticipation and empowerment.\n\nThe future of peace will be built on economic \nprosperity. Aid is an important part of delivering \nsustainable economic growth around the world. It \nplays a significant role in supporting economic reforms \nand good governance, promoting the rule of law and \nbuilding the productive capacity of trade-related \nsectors. But it is the effectiveness of aid delivery that \nmatters. For example, infrastructure deficiencies that \nprevent developing economies from fully engaging in \nthe global markets need to be overcome. Estimates of \ninfrastructure financing needs, including for the roads \nand ports required to facilitate trade, dwarf global \naid. According to the Asian Development Bank, Asia \nalone will require $750 billion annually over the next \ndecade to meet its infrastructure needs. This compares \nto annual global aid flows of $130 billion. Only the \nprivate sector has the capacity to mobilize the financing \nnecessary for such massive infrastructure investments.\n\n\n\f\nThere is a role for aid in helping to overcome the \nobstacles to investment. It must attract, but should \nnever replace, private-sector capital. The returns are \nhigh. A joint report of the World Trade Organization \nand the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment estimates that every dollar invested in \naid-for-trade can lift exports from developing countries \nby $8.\n\nWe firmly believe that the economic growth of \ndeveloping countries can be unlocked through trade. \nAustralia will continue to promote trade liberalization \nthrough the World Trade Organization, through \nregional and sector-specific deals, and through bilateral \nfree trade negotiations. The Australian Government \naims to build a network of bilateral and regional \nfree-trade agreements. We will work in the World \nTrade Organization to rebuild the multilateral trading \nagenda. Australia puts the highest priority on global \neconomic reform and trade liberalization as the best \nway to secure jobs and economic growth. These will be \nkey themes for us as we chair the Group of 20 in 2014.\n\nNo one should pretend that the economic sphere \nexists in isolation from other parts of our human \nexperience. Economic progress alone is not sufficient. \nWe need to ensure that all people around the world are \nfree to fully exercise their economic, civil and political \nrights. Australia was one of eight nations involved in \ndrafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \nand in 1948 the Australian President of the General \nAssembly, our Foreign Minister Mr. H. V. Evatt, \noversaw the adoption of the Declaration (see A/PV.183).\n\nSince then, Australia has been at the forefront of \ndefending human rights globally and regionally in support \nof equality and fundamental freedoms \u2014 freedom \nfrom discrimination; freedom from slavery, torture, \narbitrary arrest, detention or exile; freedom of speech, \nconscience and religion; freedom to work, to enjoy \nhealth and education and to participate in the life of \nthe community. Importantly, these freedoms must \nextend to all women and girls, including through equal \naccess to employment, resources, education and health \nservices, and they must be underpinned by robust and \nindependent legal systems to enforce economic, social \nand political rights.\n\nAustralia will continue to promote and protect \nhuman rights standards around the world. That is \nwhy we are seeking membership of the Human Rights \nCouncil for the 2018-2020 term.\n\nThe situation in Syria is an urgent security and \nhumanitarian crisis we must address. Left unchecked, \nit will continue to cause great human suffering and \nfurther destabilize the region. Along with the rest of the \nworld, Australia has condemned the horrific chemical \nweapons attack on 21 August, as we have condemned \nthe Al-Assad regime\u2019s use of conventional weapons \nagainst its own people.\n\nThe first obligation of any Government is to protect \nits own citizens. In 2005, leaders of all States Members \nof the United Nations signed on to this principle in the \nWorld Summit Outcome on the responsibility to protect \n(resolution 60/1). Australia, as current President of the \nSecurity Council, will therefore co-sponsor a draft \nresolution before the Council that condemns in the \nstrongest terms any use of chemical weapons. The draft \nresolution will make clear, for the first time, that the use \nof chemical weapons is a threat to international peace \nand security, and in doing so set a new international \nnorm that will help to deter future use. It will say that \nthose responsible for using such weapons must be \nbrought to justice \u2014 a call we strongly endorse.\n\nWe welcome the fact that draft resolution sets \nout in no uncertain terms that the Al-Assad regime \nmust comply fully with the requirement to destroy its \nchemical weapons. The Organization for the Prohibition \nof Chemical Weapons now needs strong international \nsupport for its role in the destruction of Syria\u2019s chemical \nweapons.\n\nAustralia will also continue to press for the Council \nto take action to assist the humanitarian effort in Syria \nand, of course, provide our full backing to efforts to \nfind a political solution in accordance with the Geneva \ncommuniqu\u00e9 (S/2012/523, annex) that leads to a \ncessation of violence and a political transition which \nmeets the aspirations of all Syrians.\n\nBut we cannot just focus on a single instance of \nglobal security, for we are engaged on security challenges \naround the world, including in the Indo-Pacific region. \nThrough our Security Council membership, we draw on \nlessons learned from our experience in peacekeeping \nand peacebuilding and take forward initiatives that \nare meaningful to our region. We welcome the strong \nsupport which the Security Council gave yesterday to \nAustralia\u2019s resolution 2117 (2013) on small arms and \nlight weapons. These weapons are a major driver of \nmany conflicts that are brought to the attention of the \nCouncil.\n\n\n\f\nWhen Australia led the Regional Assistance \nMission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) 13 years \nago with our friends from New Zealand, Papua New \nGuinea and other countries of the Pacific, one of the \nfirst tasks the Mission faced was to restore peace and \nsecurity. RAMSI moved quickly to secure the surrender \nof firearms \u2014 an early and decisive action that \nunderpinned the peace that was built and maintained \nover the next 10 years. And women played a crucial \npart.\n\nThat is why, throughout the Pacific, we are \nsupporting efforts to strengthen women\u2019s participation \nin policing, through recruitment, retention, training \nand mentoring support. In the Philippines, Australia \nis funding women\u2019s participation in peace processes \nthat bring together Muslim, Christian and indigenous \nwomen. And we continue to build on our record on \nsecurity, disarmament and peacekeeping. As co-author \nof the draft resolution, we worked to secure the adoption \nof the world\u2019s first Arms Trade Treaty (resolution \n67/234 B), which has now been signed by the majority \nof the United Nations membership, with a further 18 \nsignatories being obtained during the course of this \nweek.\n\nOutside of the Council, we work directly with \ncountries in our region to build their security. Australia \ncommends the efforts of Timor-Leste and the Group of \nSeven Plus countries emerging from conflict, including \nSolomon Islands and Afghanistan, in their efforts to \npromote the rule of law, civil and political institutions \nand a strong private sector.\n\nThe United Nations is a vital forum for the security \nand prosperity of our world. That is what Harry \nTruman, President of the United States at the time the \nUnited Nations was founded, imagined when he spoke \nof a \u201cworld fabric of international security and growing \nprosperity\u201d. No community can build lives, families \nand nations in the absence of stability, predictability \nand security. No country can ensure the security of its \npeople without an economy that offers them the dignity \nto pursue lives they value.\n\nAs you have made clear, Mr. President, the task the \nUnited Nations takes on this year and next, setting the \nstage for the post-2015 development agenda, is one that \ncould set the course of humankind for decades to come. \nOn behalf of the people of Australia, I wish all nations \nwell in taking on that task, and commit Australia to play \nits part. Together, we will strive to build the prosperity \nthat underpins and supports international peace and \nsecurity.\n"

        "file_text": "I would first like to salute you, Ambassador John \nAshe of Antigua and Barbuda, on your election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly. Mr. President, we \nare sure you will bring all your experience and wisdom \nto bear in the conduct of our debates and in carrying out \nthe General Assembly\u2019s important tasks.\n\nAt the outset, I would like to commend the \nremarkable work the United Nations has done so that \nwe have the opportunity to advance the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and to work together today \nto set a new post-2015 development agenda. Indeed, \nthat is a global challenge that, besides inaugurating a \nnew era in global development, challenges us to meet \nthe eight Millennium Development Goals. The focus of \nthis session, as was declared by Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon, is fairness and dignity for all, a task that \nchallenges everyone and requires new attitudes and \nbehaviours, based on the premise that a better world is \npossible.\n\nCape Verde, a small island developing State that \nhas been independent for less than 39 years, has already \nachieved most of the targets envisioned and will continue \nits efforts to meet all the Millennium Development \nGoals. Thanks to a transformation agenda that we have \nbeen promoting since 2001, when Cape Verde was on \nthe list of least developed countries, our nation has \nmade significant progress in the socioeconomic and \npolitical arenas and has improved the people\u2019s overall \nstandard of living. Our focus on and investment in \naccess to education, health care, water and food have \nbeen clear, unambiguous and systematic, as have \nour efforts to competitively integrate our economy \ninto the international market, with the support of our \ninternational partners.\n\nAt the same time, the transformation agenda, \nwhich is fully aligned with our MDG commitments \nand targets, has created the conditions for Cape Verde\u2019s \nhistoric transition to the realm of middle-income \ncountries, although, owing to the strong impact of the \ninternational crisis, which has to some extent put the \nbrakes on the momentum of the country\u2019s ongoing \nprogress, it still falls within the lower-middle-income \nscale. Our indicators show that we have reduced poverty \nby half, and it is clearly on a downward trend. Our \ncurrent challenge is the close monitoring essential to \npreventing any setbacks that might result from the global \neconomic situation and its impact on Cape Verde. In \nfact, despite our graduation to middle-income-country \nstatus, our indicators still show high rates of poverty, \ninequality and unemployment, as well as insufficient \naccess to many goods and services, and we are still \nshort of our goal of achieving well-being and and a high \nstandard of living for all our people.\n\n\n\f\nCape Verdeans are ready to push for the evolution \nof the terms of the Millennium Development Goals and \nreplace \u201creducing\u201d extreme poverty with \u201ceradicating\u201d \nit, leaving none behind. Moreover, we in Cape Verde \nare ready to put the issue of economic sustainability \nat the centre of the country\u2019s development agenda \nand have already begun to do so. We recognize \nthat \u201ctransformation\u201d in Cape Verde is more than \na key word; it is an agenda for work stemming from \ninclusive growth. In addition, we have been creating \naccountable institutions, open to all, in order to ensure \ngood governance. Based on that perspective, we have \nrefocused our internal policy, and are thus mobilizing \nour national will while appealing for support from our \ninternational partners, towards the goal of reaching \nadvanced-development status by 2030. That is what it \nmeans for us to commit to a post-2015 agenda.\n\nWe are currently in a transition period. The \ninstruments we have created on our own are not enough \nto respond to the questions of today or to prepare for a \nfuture moving towards advanced development, unless \nthat is a part of a global agenda led by the United Nations \nand involving intensive international cooperation and \npartnership at both the multilateral and bilateral levels. \nCape Verde is committed to that joint effort. Cape \nVerdeans are deeply focused on global issues, such \nas climate change, hunger and malnutrition and the \nvarious forms of inequality, as well as the importance \nof ensuring environmental sustainability and national \nand international partnerships in support of global \ndevelopment.\n\nClimate change is a pressing problem of our times \nthat must be addressed with urgency and a great sense \nof responsibility. The world has reached record highs \nin terms of emissions and the concentration of carbon \ndioxide in the atmosphere, which is now at about 400 \nparts per million. That could mean the destruction of \nour development efforts and, even worse, the serious \nexacerbation of social tensions, which could potentially \nopen the door to both national and regional conflicts. \nSimilarly, the effects of climate change on global food \nsecurity should be stressed. Ocean acidification is \nincreasing at a rate that has not been seen in 55 million \nyears. Ultimately, the disappearance of numerous \nmarine species has become inevitable. We must all \nconfront this issue, which endangers our common \nfuture, and take the necessary decisions, fulfilling \nour financial commitments aimed at adaptation, \nparticularly in the most vulnerable countries.\n\nWith respect to the post-2015 agenda, the issue of \nemployment dominates the concerns of Cape Verdeans. \nThe subject occupies the top spot among all consulted, \nwho identify employment as essential to achieving \neconomic and human development. Another serious \nissue has to do with the sustainability of social security. \nWe need a more universal welfare system, and we must \ncreate and introduce instruments for that purpose. That \nis possible only with a more dynamic economy. \n\nThere will be no transformation agenda if we do \nnot create solid, sustainable foundations for social \nprotection. To do so, we need to grow and expand wealth, \nas well as provide a greater number of decent jobs. We \nneed to create a wave of modernization for society and \nfor the competitive factors of our economy, so as to \nimprove the business environment and attract foreign \ninvestment. The larger result will be economic growth \nand the creation of wealth to induce the improvement of \nindicators that matter. We must recognize that there is \nroom for improvement, particularly in terms of reducing \nState bureaucracy and increasing competitiveness, as \nwell as in terms of making foreign investment more \nstreamlined and more efficient for entrepreneurship. \nWe urge our citizens to be productive, competitive \nand prosperous, without losing the vast Cape Verdean \ncapacity for generosity, solidarity and responsibility.\n\nThe continuation of the international crisis and \nits impact on all countries creates serious problems \nfor the entire world community. In the case of Cape \nVerde, the situation poses serious challenges that we \nmust overcome, namely, obstacles to the acceleration \nof economic growth, the promotion of employment and \nthe reduction of poverty. At this sixty-eighth session of \nthe General Assembly, we reiterate our commitment to \npeace and dialogue, within the parameters enshrined in \nthe Charter of the United Nations.\n\nOur vision of the United Nations is of a more \ncohesive and united Organization in which efforts are \nundertaken for the prosperity of nations. Our vision of \nthe General Assembly is of a great forum for dialogue \non the global challenges of our planet and humankind, \nand our vision of the Security Council is of a body with \na more balanced representation that is better suited to \nthe geopolitical developments that the world has known \nsince 1945. \n\nThis is a unique opportunity for Cape Verde, \na Portuguese-speaking country, to reaffirm its \ncommitment to cultural diversity and, in its quest for \n\n\n\f\nmulticulturalism, which is its prerogative, to call for the \nPortuguese language \u2014 the fifth most widely spoken \nlanguage in the world, connecting States and peoples \nacross five continents \u2014 to be recognized as an official \nor a working language of international organizations, \nparticularly the United Nations.\n\nWe wish to make one more comment as we \nposition ourselves, following the report of the United \nNations Mission to Investigate Allegations of the Use \nof Chemical Weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic on \nthe alleged use of chemical weapons in the Ghouta area \nof Damascus on 21 August (A/67/997), which we have \nstudied with close attention. We welcome the progress \nmade towards dialogue, particularly the joint search for \npeaceful solutions, especially at the United Nations. We \nare against the use of weapons of mass destruction, and \nwe will continue to align with subsequent initiatives \ntowards their eradication. As we are against war and \nbelligerence, we advocate for the implementation of a \nglobal strategy to combat violence. \n\nWe wish to express our solidarity with the \nGovernment and the people of Kenya, as well as our \nunequivocal condemnation of the reprehensible acts \nof barbarism and human savagery that occurred last \nSaturday in Nairobi. \n\nWe urge all the members of the General Assembly to \nreach a historic agreement in favour of the environment. \nThe main objective is to implement the established \nGoals in the outcome document of the United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development, entitled \n\u201cThe future we want\u201d (resolution 66/288, annex). We \nalso reaffirm our resolute willingness to cooperate \nwith everyone to reduce regional and global tensions, \nso as to broaden the understanding of sovereignties, \nfreedoms and human rights.\n\nFinally, we reiterate our preference for the \njoint definition of new goals that will stipulate the \nfundamentals for the prosperity of countries and for the \nwelfare of the world\u2019s people, crafting together a post-\n2015 agenda. Cape Verde is committed to making its \ncontribution to the creation of a new goals scenario to \nsucceed and complement the Millennium Development \nGoals. Our common commitment is meeting the eight \nGoals and our shared responsibility is creating a new \npost-2015 agenda in favour of sustainable development. \nThe manner in which we do it will determine our \ncommon destiny. The importance of our decisions \nand the responsibility to make them within the \nUnited Nations framework are evident. Let us get to \nwork to create a new global dynamic that leads to a \njoint vision for promoting progress. Cape Verde is \nfirmly committed to the establishment of a post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda; that is also the future we want. \nWe assure the Assembly that we will do everything in \nour power in the name of a better future, filled with \nfreedom, equality and prosperity. The international \ncommunity can count on us.\n"

        "file_text": " In the year 2000, we met \nhere and agreed on the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) for 2015. They are: Goal 1, the eradication of \nextreme poverty and hunger; Goal 2, achieving universal \nprimary education; Goal 3, promoting gender equality \nand the empowerment of women; Goal 4, reducing child \nmortality; Goal 5, improving maternal health; Goal 6, \ncombatting HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases; \nGoal 7, ensuring environmental sustainability; and Goal \n8, developing a global partnership for development. As \nwe can see, they cannot be sustainably achieved unless \nwe achieve socioeconomic transformation. That means \nbuilding a new society comprised of the middle class \nand the skilled working class out of the pre-capitalist \nsocieties that characterize underdeveloped countries. \n\nOur old society of traditional Africa had and has \nto undergo socioeconomic metamorphosis, just like \nthe insects do, taking on new forms of life \u2014 egg, \ncaterpillar, pupa, adult butterfly or other insect, and so \non \u2014 of the same organism. That means fewer people in \nagriculture than in industry and services, more people \nin urban centres than in rural areas, no illiteracy, and \nmodern agriculture rather than subsistence traditional \nagriculture or uneconomic colonial cash crops that \nbring in little for the affected families. I hope that no \none had imagined that we could sustainably attain the \nMDGs while maintaining a backward economy. \n\n\n\f\nWe in Uganda discovered the following bottlenecks \nto socioeconomic transformation. \n\nThe first is ideological disorientation. The \nsecond is a weak State \u2014 no army and a weak police, \njudiciary and civil service. The third is inadequate \ninfrastructure, including inadequate electricity, lack of \nroads, lack of a railway system, lack of information and \ncommunications technology infrastructure, and so on. \nAll of this means high costs for doing business in a \ngiven country. That scares away business, and without \nbusiness there can be no employment, no production of \ngoods and services and no expansion of the tax base. It \nis a vicious circle.\n\nThe fourth bottleneck relates to human resources \nthat are undeveloped on account of lack of education \nand poor health. An illiterate and unhealthy population \ncannot be the agent of socioeconomic transformation. \nThe fifth is the issue of small internal markets resulting \nfrom the colonial balkanization of Africa. Those had \nto be worked on through regional market integration. \nOne cannot sustainably produce if sufficient numbers \nof people do not buy one\u2019s goods.\n\nSixth, a lack of industrialization and a failure to \nmodernize services meant that we continued to export \nraw materials at 10 per cent or less of the final value of \nthe final product, thereby losing money and jobs to the \noutside world. The lack of modern services meant that \nwe could not attract tourists and had to import services \nfrom outside in the form of professional and medical \nservices, inter alia, in addition to jobs not being created.\n\nSeventh, the failure to modernize agriculture \ninhibits the earning capacity of the affected portions of \nthe population and the country, stunts job creation and \naffects food security.\n\nEighth, the additional mistake was made of \ninterfering with the private sector, influenced by \nan incorrect analysis of the national interest. Was \nthe private sector causing the national economy to \nhaemorrhage by repatriating dividends, or was it \ncreating an infusion of fresh money and knowledge and \nexpanding the size of the economy? Fortunately, that \nmistake has been corrected in Uganda and in much of \nAfrica.\n\nThose are the bottlenecks that directly affected the \nrate of socioeconomic transformation. I do not wish to \ngo into the political bottlenecks here.\n\nIn Uganda, therefore, we were clear about all of \nthose from the very beginning. It was not possible to \ntalk of the MDGs sustainably without talking about \nthose strategic bottlenecks. You could not sustainably \nbase yourself on donor support to achieve the MDGs.\n\nIn spite of the fact that a number of mistakes were \nmade by some of our actors, Uganda will have achieved \nthe following MDGs by 2015.\n\nFirst, eradicate extreme poverty and \nhunger \u2014 already achieved; second, achieve universal \nprimary education \u2014 already achieved; third, promote \ngender equality \u2014 already achieved; fourth, reduce \nchild mortality \u2014 already achieved; fifth, improve \nmaternal health \u2014 achieving this one has been slow \nto be achieved because of mistakes on our side; sixth, \ncombat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases \u2014 we are \non track to achieve this, except as concerns new AIDS \ninfections, which have increased slightly; seventh, \nensure environmental sustainability by increasing the \nelectrification of the economy, so as to stop the cutting \nof forests for firewood and for primitive agriculture \nby modernizing agriculture and shifting a greater \nportion of the population towards industry, away from \nagriculture.\n\nWe have been working on Goal 8, developing a \nglobal partnership for development, first and foremost \nby working for economic and political integration in \nAfrica and for market access to the rest of the world on \nthe basis of mutual advantage. The process of market \nintegration in Africa has already started in the form \nof the East African Community, the Common Market \nfor Eastern and Southern Africa, the Southern African \nDevelopment Community, the Economic Community \nof West African States and the Economic Community \nof Central African States.\n\nAs part of the global partnership, we should be \nvery careful not to lose the easing in global tensions \nthat came with the end of the Cold War. In the Book of \nMatthew, Jesus says : \n\n\u201c By their their fruit you will recognize them. \nDo people pick grapes from thorn bushes, or figs \nfrom thistles? Likewise, every good tree bears \ngood fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good \ntree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot \nbear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good \nfruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, \nby their fruit you will recognize them.\u201d (The Holy \nBible, Matthew 7:16-20)\n\f\nA good system will prove its superiority by \nexample. The Book of Matthew also states: \n\n\u201cIn the same way, let your light shine before \nothers, that they may see your good deeds and \nglorify your Father in heaven.\u201d (ibid., Matthew 5:16)\nWe do not have to create new global tensions in \norder to deal with criminals. Where there is a need for \ninternational action, regional and global consensus \nshould be sought so that we unite the many to defeat \nthe few and isolate the enemy to the maximum, as the \nlate Chairman Mao Zedong used to say. Where there is \na need to fight for freedom, oppressed people can fight \nfor themselves. They do not have to be sponsored by \nexternal forces. Those who seek external sponsorship \nas their primary aim are suspect, to say the least. \n\nStill on the issue of global partnership, I cannot \nfail to stress our anger vis-\u00e0-vis actors who are \nbeginning to make it a habit to ignore African Union \npositions on African matters. One of our slogans in the \ndecolonization struggle was \u201cAfrica for the Africans\u201d. \nSome people seem to think that that was an empty \nslogan. They are wrong. Although the patriotic forces \nhave been taken by surprise by this renewed arrogance \nby the old mistake-makers, they will react appropriately \nto protect Africa from hegemony. \n\nThe latest manifestation of arrogance is from the \nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) in relation to the \nelected leaders of Kenya. Many African countries \nsupported the establishment of the Court because we \nabhor impunity. However, in a shallow, biased way, \nthe ICC has continued to mishandle complex African \nissues. That is not acceptable. The ICC should stop. Our \nadvice to it is from very capable actors who know what \nthey are doing and who know what they are saying. \nKenya is recovering. Let it recover. We know the origin \nof the mistakes of the past. The ICC way is not the right \none for handling those mistakes.\n\n\n\nIn our struggle for socioeconomic transformation, \nour biggest problem has been funding. The small \nmodern colonial economy of Uganda was destroyed \nby Idi Amin. Initially, as we struggled for minimal \neconomic recovery, we had to depend on external \nfunding. Although useful, that funding was limited, \nslow in coming, not always focused, and erratic. \nAlthough our economy succeeded in achieving an \naverage annual growth rate of 6.5 per cent per annum \nover the past 20 years, we could have achieved much \nhigher rates of growth, especially if we had had reliable \nfunding for infrastructure, \n\nNow that we have a little bit of our own money, \nwe are able to implement infrastructure projects much \nfaster. Even without oil and gas, we were able to move \nmuch faster in terms of infrastructure development by \nrelying on ourselves. Of course, additional external \nfunding, if it is focused, sizeable and on time, can be \nvery useful. Without a doubt, Uganda and much of \nAfrica are moving forward robustly. With the resources \nfrom the oil and gas we discovered a few years ago, \nwe will be able to fund all our infrastructure needs. \nThe future is bright and our forward movement is \nirreversible.\n\n"

        "file_text": "It gives me \npleasure to congratulate Mr. John Ashe and his friendly \ncountry, Antigua and Barbuda, upon his assumption \nof the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\neighth session. I take this opportunity to express my \nsincere appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Vuk \nJeremi. of Serbia, for his efforts during the previous \nsession.\n\nI reiterate our support to the Secretary-General as \nhe strives to realize the purposes and principles of the \nCharter. I also welcome the choice of \u201cThe post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage\u201d as the main \ntheme of this session, considering the high priority that \nthe United Nations and the peoples of the world accord \nto the achievement of development in all its dimensions.\n\nAllow me to deviate from customary practice for \na debate in the General Assembly by conveying to \nthe Assembly a message that comes not only from the \nPresident of Egypt, Mr. Adly Mansour, but from the \npeople of my country \u2014 the Egyptians who laid the \nfoundations of human civilization and have recently \ninspired peoples around the world. \n\nEgypt holds a unique position in the history of \nhumankind, past and present. Its status, role and influence \nderive essentially from its culture and civilization. It \nwould have been a historical inconsistency had the will \nof the Egyptians remained shackled at the dawn of a \nnew century, and had our youth remained deprived of \nthe right to design their own destiny and future. It was \ntherefore natural for our people to take to the streets on \n25 January 2011 to declare their determination to build \na democratic and modern State in which their children \ncould enjoy freedom, dignity and social justice.\n\nThis is the Egypt that millions of my countrymen \nand women chose then \u2014 the same Egypt they yearned \nfor on 30 June 2013. In doing so, they showed the world \nthat the will of the people cannot be broken and that it \ncan grant authority, just as it can remove it from the \nhands of those who abuse it.\n\nThe Egyptians have an ambitious vision for the \nfuture that can be achieved by working systematically \nin a reasonable time frame. Its success is based on a \nsociety that is open to all peaceful political currents, \nthat pluralistically embraces the diversity of all its \n\n\n\f\nmembers, and that inclusively ensures the equal rights \nand duties of all citizens through the rule of law and \nequality before justice. The principles and practices of \nthis vision are consistent with the fundamental rules \nthat govern democratic practices throughout the world, \nin particular respect for peaceful dialogue, the rejection \nof violence, the rule of law and respect for human rights.\n\nOur conviction that Egyptians have the right to \nfulfil such a vision underpins the road map that Egypt \nhas been implementing since 3 July. That road map \nincludes a national agenda to build the institutions of a \ndemocratic State in a specific time frame. All Egyptians \nare invited to participate in all phases of the political \nprocess, as long as they are committed to renouncing \nviolence and terrorism or incitement thereto.\n\nWork is under way, in line with the road map, on \nseveral tracks. To date, it has succeeded in establishing \nthe principles of justice, freedom and democracy as \nbases for governance. Work is under way on the new \nconstitution, to be followed by parliamentary elections \nand presidential elections, bringing the transitional \nphase to an end by next spring. We are determined to \nfully implement the road map. This requires us to give \nthe utmost priority to preserving security, enforcing \nthe law and countering any attempts to intimidate \nor humiliate us or hinder our efforts. Some parts of \nEgypt were recently hit by desperate terrorist attacks. \nAmong their victims were Egyptians from all walks of \nlife \u2014 men and women, young and old, Muslims and \nnon-Muslims. Those hideous acts of terrorism sought \nto undermine the democratic process and to destroy \nour economy. I would like to emphasize and reiterate \nin the strongest terms our full confidence that the brave \nEgyptian people, who succeeded in imposing their \nwill, can eradicate terrorism within the framework of \nthe rule of law. I trust that the international community \nwill stand firmly with the Egyptian people in the fight \nagainst those who commit or advocate for violence, and \nwill accept no attempt to justify or tolerate it.\n\nI take this opportunity to convey my deep \ncondolences to the Government and the people of \nKenya and Pakistan on the loss of innocent lives as a \nresult of the latest terrorist attack.\n\nThe message I am carrying from Egyptians, \nparticularly our youth, who are joining me here today \nand representing their ancient country, would not be \ncomplete without mentioning Egypt\u2019s aspirations to \nenjoy more democratic international relations and \nstronger ties of cooperation between our people and \nthe rest of the world. Those relations should be based \non the principles of independence, mutual respect \nand non-interference in the internal affairs of other \ncountries and on a foreign policy founded on equality \nand a constructive, civilized vision for the future. \nEgypt\u2019s foreign policy is now a reflection of the will \nof our people, and it is formulated in line with our \nnational interests and security with no regard to any \nother consideration.\n\nWe fully recognize that Egypt\u2019s national security \nis linked to the security and concerns of our Arab \nnation. Given its geographical location, history and \nidentity, Egypt is committed to continuing to defend \nthe interests of its African continent, to address the \nissues of importance to the Islamic world, to spread \nthe Islamic values of moderation and tolerance, and to \npromote dialogue among divine religions. Egypt also \nremains committed to tackling the challenges facing \nthe South at a time when the world is witnessing an \nimbalance of power.\n\nI would now like to briefly highlight Egypt\u2019s \nposition on several issues of high priority in our foreign \npolicy.\n\nIn Syria, the tragedy has now extended to the resort \nto chemical weapons. We strongly condemn their use \nand support the agreement reached between the Russian \nFederation and the United States, as well as Security \nCouncil resolution 2118 (2013). While the humanitarian \ncrisis resulting from the fighting continues to intensify, \nthe Syrian State itself is on the verge of disintegration. \nIt is imperative to reach a political solution as soon \nas possible that would establish the freedom, dignity \nand democracy to which the people of Syria aspire \nand preserve the unity of the State. We hope that can \nbe achieved through the holding of the \u201cGeneva II\u201d \nconference, so that a transitional authority can be put in \nplace to end the civil war and the foreign interventions \nthat we have long warned against.\n\nThe Palestinian question remains the main source \nof tension in our region. Palestine is still suffering \nthe effects of the ongoing Israeli occupation of Arab \nterritories and the intensification of settlement activities. \nThe hope for achieving a two-State solution was until \nrecently on the verge of fading away irrevocably. \nGiven that bleak scenario, we welcome and appreciate \nthe recent efforts of the United States to advance the \nresumption of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. The \n\n\n\f\ncommitment of both sides to engaging in a process of \ntime-bound negotiations is a significant development. \nWe should all support the ongoing negotiations so that \nthey may lead to the final settlement of the Palestinian \nquestion, which has continued since the past century.\n\nEgypt will continue to support the right of the \nPalestinian people to self-determination and the \nestablishment of an independent and sovereign State, \nwith East Jerusalem as its capital, on all the territories \nof the West Bank and Gaza and in accordance with the \nArab Peace Initiative and the relevant terms of reference. \nI reiterate that the needs of the Gaza population must \nbe met. The failure to do so has become politically \nand morally unacceptable. We therefore call on Israel \nand the international community to shoulder their \nresponsibilities and ensure that the Palestinians in Gaza \nhave access to basic supplies. We are ready to cooperate \nwith the Palestinian authority and all concerned parties \nto agree on appropriate arrangements that guarantee \nthe delivery of provisions in legal and transparent ways.\n\nThe Assembly will agree that a new Middle East \nwill not emerge until the right to equal security is \nensured and the threats posed by the existence in our \nregion of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction are eliminated. The situation threatens \nthe credibility of the non-proliferation regime and the \nUnited Nations. For that reason, and to preserve that \ncredibility, I would like to introduce to the Assembly \ntoday an initiative consisting of the following steps.\n\nFirst, we must invite all countries of the Middle \nEast and the five permanent members of the Security \nCouncil to deposit official letters with the Secretary-\nGeneral stating their support for declaring the Middle \nEast a region free from nuclear, chemical and biological \nweapons of mass destruction.\n\nSecondly, the countries of the region that have not \nsigned or ratified any of the international conventions \non weapons of mass destruction should commit, before \nthe end of 2013, to simultaneously signing and ratifying \nthe relevant conventions. They should also deposit \ndocumentation of their accession to those conventions \nwith the Security Council. I invite the Secretary-\nGeneral to coordinate such steps so that they are carried \nout simultaneously to ensure their success.\n\nThose actions translate into the following. Israel \nmust accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \nof Nuclear Weapons as a non-nuclear State, ratify the \nChemical Weapons Convention, and sign and ratify the \nBiological Weapons Convention. Syria must ratify the \nBiological Weapons Convention and take the remaining \nsteps it has pledged to take in relation to the Chemical \nWeapons Convention. Egypt must ratify the Biological \nWeapons Convention and sign and ratify the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, provided that all countries of \nthe Middle East complete measures of accession to the \ninternational conventions prohibiting weapons of mass \ndestruction and related arrangements and treaties.\n\nThirdly, we must pursue international efforts to \nensure that the delayed 2012 conference to establish a \nMiddle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction \nis convened as soon as possible, preferably before the \nend of 2013 and by the spring of 2014 at the latest.\n\nEgypt\u2019s roots go deep in Africa. We are proud of \nthe many positive changes that Africa has witnessed \nand of the strides the continent has taken towards \ndemocracy and development. Yet Africa remains in \nneed of concerted national, regional and international \nefforts to enable the continent to resolve its conflicts \nand challenges. Accordingly, Egypt will soon establish \nan Egyptian agency for development partnership. Most \nof its future resources will be directed to African \ncountries so that they can benefit from Egyptian \ntechnical expertise and assets.\n\nWe cannot talk about democracy in current \ninternational relations and the rule of law at the \ninternational level unless comprehensive and \nsubstantial reform of the United Nations takes place, \nso that the Organization is better able to respond to \nchallenges and to meet the aspirations of peoples \nworldwide. The only logical and sound way to achieve \nthat desired outcome is the reform and expansion of the \nSecurity Council. Egypt therefore renews its call for \nan end to the monopoly of permanent members over \nthe decision-making process in the Council and for \nthe rectification of the historical injustice inflicted on \nAfrica. The continent does not have a permanent seat \non the Council and is poorly represented in the category \nof non-permanent members. Africa will not renounce \nits demands to obtain the permanent membership it \ndeserves, as specified in the Ezulwini Consensus and \nthe Sirte Declaration.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to highlight our \npriority issues within the United Nations system. They \ninclude strengthening the international human rights \nframework, addressing the absence of democracy in \ninternational relations, accelerating the achievement of \n\n\n\f\nthe Millennium Development Goals, realizing nuclear \ndisarmament and fighting corruption, including \nrecovering the assets stolen by key members of the \nregimes recently brought down by our peoples. We \nreiterate that we are determined to continue empowering \nwomen nationally and internationally, to protecting \nhuman rights, and to allowing our youth to contribute \neffectively to the elaboration of Egypt\u2019s vision for the \nworld and for its future. \n\nI take this opportunity to welcome the appointment \na few months ago by the Secretary-General of a Special \nEnvoy on Youth who comes from the Arab world. We \nmust also exert concerted efforts at the international \nlevel to combat terrorism and strengthen the capacity \nof the United Nations to coordinate those efforts and \naddress the root causes of terrorism.\n\nIn conclusion, I truly hope that the message I have \ndelivered on behalf of the people and the President of \nEgypt has been received by the Assembly today. I also \nhope that the aspirations it identified will be realized so \nthat we may achieve progress, peace and development \nand that next year we may reap the fruits of our labour. \n"

We wish him every success, \nand he has New Zealand\u2019s support.\n\nThe recent events in Kenya, Iraq and Pakistan show \nhow troubled the world can be. We commiserate with \nthe Governments and peoples of those countries and \nextend our deepest sympathies to those who lost family \nand friends in those tragic incidents.\n\nFor most of us, born after the Second World War, the \nUnited Nations has been at the centre of our conception \nof how the world organizes itself. But the reality of the \nUnited Nations can be quite challenging. It is the one \nplace where the countries of the world meet, talk and \ntry to find solutions to global and regional issues.\n\nSadly, some of those discussions can become so \narcane that they are sometimes quite removed from the \nissues they claim to be addressing. That is a concern in \nparticular for small States, to which the Organization is \nso vitally important. \n\nEven more sadly, the United Nations has too often \nfailed to provide solutions to the problems the world \nexpects it to resolve. The gap between aspiration and \ndelivery is all too apparent, as the situation in Syria \nhas again so brutally reminded us. But any failures of \nthis institution are less failures of the Organization \nthan they are failures on our part, as its Member States, \nand on the part of those who have the responsibility of \nleading those States.\n\nThere would be no dreadful humanitarian situation \nin Syria if Syria\u2019s leaders had upheld the commitments \nmade to the international community and to the Syrian \npeople when Syria joined the Organization and ratified \nthe human rights covenants.\n\nThe Organization would not also have been a \npowerless bystander to the Syrian tragedy for over \ntwo years if the lack of agreement among the Security \nCouncil\u2019s permanent members had not shielded the \nAl-Assad regime, thereby reconfirming the fears of \nNew Zealand and others that had opposed the veto at \nthe original San Francisco Conference, in 1945.\n\nNew Zealand is pleased that the Security Council \nhas at last met on the situation in Syria. The Secretary-\nGeneral has advised the Council and the General \nAssembly that the United Nations Mission has now \nconfirmed, unequivocally and objectively, that \nchemical weapons have been used in Syria. The report \n(see A/67/997) found clear and convincing evidence \nthat surface-to-surface rockets containing the nerve \nagent Sarin were used on 21 August.\n\nThe information in the report also makes it very \nclear that those rockets must have been fired by the \nSyrian regime. As the Secretary-General has said, these \nare war crimes, and those responsible must be brought \nto account.\n\nThose that try to cast doubt on the report\u2019s \nconclusions make themselves look foolish and do a \ndisservice to the United Nations.\n\nIt is imperative now that the Council act. It must \nadopt a resolution that responds to the use of chemical \nweapons. It must find a means to hold those responsible \nto account and establish an effective mechanism \nfor the destruction of those weapons in line with the \nproposal developed by the United States and Russia. \nThe resolution must also provide for the protection of \nthe civilian population. \n\nWhile Syria necessarily commands our attention, \nI also want to spend some time on some more positive \ndevelopments for both the Organization and its Member \nStates. I want to begin with my own country, New \nZealand, whose emergence as a fully independent State \nhas proceeded in parallel with the development of the \nUnited Nations.\n\n\n\f\nNew Zealand was present at the founding in San \nFrancisco. We take pride in the fact that we were able \nto influence the drafting of the Charter, particularly the \nsection on the Trusteeship Council, which paved the \nway for a number of States to become full Members of \nthe Organization.\n\nNew Zealand has come a long way since the Charter \nwas adopted. Then, we were emerging from our status \nas a dominion of the United Kingdom. Today we proudly \nassert ourselves as a small but independent and diverse \ncountry that has a wide network of friends and trading \nrelationships in all the major regions and markets of \nthe world. We value our traditional relationships with \nAustralia and the Pacific, and in Europe and North \nAmerica as we build new links with partners in Asia, \nthe rest of the Americas and the Caribbean, and Africa.\n\nBuilding and sustaining political and commercial \nlinks across the regions of the world is no small matter \nfor a country like New Zealand. We are surrounded by \nthe Pacific Ocean and located over three hours\u2019 flying \ntime from our nearest neighbour, Australia, in one of \nthe least populated parts of the world. We share with \nour Pacific island neighbours the challenges of distance \nand isolation, and of having to hold our own against \nmuch larger countries whose economies of scale \nand proximity to markets give them a considerable \ncompetitive advantage. These factors have reinforced \nNew Zealand\u2019s approach to the United Nations and to \nthe other international organizations that have shaped \nthe post-Second World War environment.\n\nWe have a strong preference for a rules-based, \nmultilateralist approach, whether in the United \nNations, the World Trade Organization (WTO) or the \nWorld Bank. We know that rules and standards set \ninternationally provide us the greatest certainty and \nthe greatest protection. We draw strength from global \nagreements and from the collective commitment they \nrepresent.\n\nThat is why we attach such importance to the \ncompletion of the Doha Round. While New Zealand \ncontinues to actively negotiate bilateral and regional \ntrade agreements, we acknowledge that free trade \nagreements often leave least developed countries on the \nsidelines. The benefit of the WTO, as with the United \nNations, is that the rules negotiated there apply across \nthe globe, irrespective of a country\u2019s size or wealth.\n\nOur preference for international rules reflects New \nZealand\u2019s national approach to governance. We have \na robust and transparent system of Government and \nsound financial institutions that have helped us ride out \nthe worst effects of the global financial crisis. That was \ndespite the significant economic and social challenges \nwe faced after the destructive earthquake that struck \nChristchurch, our second largest city, in 2011.\n\nAs we work to restore the built environment in \nChristchurch, New Zealanders are also conscious \nof our dependence on and our responsibility towards \nthe natural environment. In policy terms, climate \nchange has been a challenge for New Zealand and \nfor the international community more broadly, but \nNew Zealanders know we must play our part, and we \nhave taken action. We have introduced an extensive \nemissions-trading scheme. We are investing in the \nGlobal Research Alliance to find new ways to manage \nagricultural greenhouse gases, and we have committed \nto reducing emissions to 5 per cent below 1990 levels \nby 2020.\n\nWe made that commitment under the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \nrather than the Kyoto Protocol. We did that because, \nwhile the Kyoto Protocol once seemed to provide a path \nforward, things have changed. The Protocol now covers \nonly a small percentage of global emissions. We need a \nsingle legal framework that commits all major emitters. \n\nWhile climate change is an important issue, it pales \nin comparison to the problems faced by many Member \nStates. One of the most intractable is that of Israel and \nPalestine. As long as that problem is left unresolved, \nthere can be no assured peace in the Middle East and no \nsecurity for the wider region. There can be no resolution \nwithout the Israeli and Palestinian peoples both being \nassured of viable homelands within secure borders. \nNew Zealand pays tribute to the tenacity of United \nStates Secretary of State Kerry and to the courage of \nPresident Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu in \nagreeing to resume the Middle East peace process.\n\nIn our own region, we have celebrated the successful \nconclusion of the United Nations Mission in Timor-Leste \nand the transition of the Regional Assistance Mission \nto the Solomon Islands from a military to a police-led \noperation. We look forward with intense interest and \ncautious hope to the reinstatement of democracy in \nFiji. We acknowledge the positive developments there, \nincluding with regard to election preparations and voter \nregistration. The countries of the Pacific, including \nNew Zealand, want and need Fiji to be successful, \ndemocratic and well-governed.\n\n\nEarlier this year, New Zealand withdrew the bulk \nof its forces from Afghanistan, following the closure of \nthe New Zealand-led provincial reconstruction team in \nBamian province, which provided security and helped \nbring about a significant improvement in governance \nand development. Schools and hospitals were rebuilt and \nhealth centres re-opened. Mortality rates for children \nunder 5 were halved. Maternal deaths are now a quarter \nof the Taliban-era levels. Girls now make up half the \nnumber of primary-school-age children. New Zealand \nexpertise also helped substantially improve agricultural \nyields through the implementation of modern farming \ntechniques. We are building the largest solar energy \nsystem in Afghanistan, which will bring a renewable \nsource of electricity to much of Bamian township. That \nwas a big commitment by a small country situated far \naway. It also came at a considerable cost: 10 of our \nservicemen and women lost their lives while on duty \nthere. Even so, we are proud of what we achieved in \npartnership with the people of Bamian and hope that \nthose gains can be sustained in the years ahead.\n\nIn Africa we see a continent where many countries \nhave faced real challenges. However, as the President of \nNigeria reminded us earlier this week (see A/68/PV.5), \nthe new story of Africa is the growing number of \ncountries in the region that are enjoying the benefits \nof good governance, sound economic growth and \ndevelopment, driving positive change throughout the \ncontinent. All of that is good news for Africa and for \nthe world. New Zealand will do what it can to help \nwith targeted assistance in areas where we have real \nexpertise to offer, namely, in the fields of agriculture, \nrenewable energy and good governance. New Zealand \nalso recognizes and supports the critical roles of the \nAfrican Union and Africa\u2019s subregional bodies in \nensuring Africa\u2019s security and future prosperity.\n\nNew Zealand recognizes the importance to Africa, \nthe Caribbean and our own region of the Arms Trade \nTreaty, adopted in April and signed by New Zealand \nand many others on 3 June The Treaty should curb the \nflows of small arms and other weapons, especially to \nconflict regions, and help arrest the deaths and human \nmisery that they cause.\n\nI want to also applaud the progress made in \nimplementing the Millennium Development Goals, \nwhile at the same time acknowledging the fact that \nmuch work remains to be done. We now need to work \ntogether on a post-2015 development agenda focused on \ncreating economic opportunities and the eradication of \npoverty.\n\nMany of the same issues will be addressed at \nthe Third International Conference on Small Island \nDeveloping States, which Samoa is to host in 2014. \nNew Zealand is pleased to be a major supporter of that \nimportant United Nations effort and, with the rest of \nthe Pacific, looks forward to welcoming the world to \nour region.\n\nWe need to remind ourselves that sound governance \narrangements and transparency of process are also \nvital virtues for international organizations, including \nthe United Nations. By any objective assessment, the \nOrganization has not been equipped with the structures \nand rules it needs to operate as it should. Yet there has \nbeen deep resistance to efforts to make things better. \nThat needs to change. The rationale for United Nations \nreform is clear. Membership has quadrupled since 1945, \nyet over the same period its key organs \u2014 particularly \nthe Security Council \u2014 have become hostage to their \nown traditions and to the interests of the most powerful. \n\nFrom the 1950s to the 1990s, we could blame the \nCold War when the Security Council did not act. That \ndoes not wash today. The problems are more systemic \nand relate both to the composition and the formal and \ninformal processes of the Council. We now seem to have \na practice whereby the permanent members not only \ncan block Council actions through the use of the veto, \nbut also appear to have privileged access to information \nand can stop the Council from meeting if it does not \nsuit their collective purposes. Such behaviour damages \nthe reputation and credibility of the wider Organization \nand must be challenged. Such issues are not necessarily \nmatters of Charter reform, which we know is difficult, \nbut have to do with the effective functioning of the \nOrganization \u2014 an issue in which we all have a stake.\n\nNew Zealand is not advocating revolution, but we \nare asserting that the Council can and must do better in \nthe way it conducts its business. That is the approach \nNew Zealand will bring to the Security Council if we \nare elected next October. If successful, it will be 21 \nyears since New Zealand last served on the Council \u2014 a \nlong time ago, but not so long that we have forgotten the \nlessons learned during our last term. At the top of that \nlist is the imperative that members have to be engaged; \nthey must listen to the concerns of others and have a \nview and a voice if they are to be relevant. There is \nno point in joining the Council simply to make up the \n\n\n\f\nnumbers. Sometimes there is a need to speak up and \nshine a light on what is going on, or not going on, even \nwhen that may be inconvenient to others. That applies \nwhether the issue was Rwanda, Somalia, Yemen or \nYugoslavia in 1993-94, or is the Democratic Republic \nof Congo, the Sudan or Syria in 2013 to 2014.\n\nMy hope is that when Member States make their \ndecision on whom to vote for in October 2014, they will \nlook at New Zealand\u2019s record and know that we will be \na credible, positive influence on the Security Council \nand a voice for the interests of the wider Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me first join previous \nspeakers in expressing my delegation\u2019s deepest \nsympathies and condolences to the families of the \nvictims and to the people and the Government of Kenya \non the terrorist attack at Westgate Mall in Nairobi.\n\nIt is almost two generations now since Eritrea \nfirst begun to lodge petitions for justice with this \nbody. Sadly, in all of those instances, the Assembly \nhas persisted in ignoring Eritrea\u2019s pleas, shuttering \nits doors as a \u201cclosed monastery\u201d. Those setbacks \nnotwithstanding, Eritrea remains firmly convinced \nthat the promotion of peoples\u2019 rights and interests and \nmutual respect among the community of nations will \nremain precarious without an international body that \nupholds the supremacy of international law and justice. \nAs such, our choice, like those of other peoples, has \nbeen and remains the funnelling of efforts towards \nexpediting the reform of the United Nations.\n\nTo focus exclusively on the harm done to the people \nand State of Eritrea may convey the false impression \nof an aberration in an otherwise effective and well-\nfunctioning United Nations. As it is, the particularity \nof our case only amplifies the wider backdrop of a \nUnited Nations debilitated by chronic weaknesses \n\n\n\f\nand shortcomings. In any event, my message today \nwill focus primarily on the urgency of reforming the \nUnited Nations and redressing the injustices committed \nagainst the people of Eritrea as well as other peoples of \nthe world.\n\nThe negative experiences during the first 50 \nyears of the existence of the United Nations and the \nparalysis and constraints under which the United \nNations had to operate in the context of the realities of \nthe Cold War in a bipolar world accentuated the need \nfor structural reform of the United Nations at that time. \nIn Eritrea\u2019s case, our inalienable right to independence \nwas trampled at the onset of the Cold War, since the \ncountry was perceived as a mere pawn in the overriding \nstrategic rivalry of both super-Powers. Our liberation \nstruggle was likewise suppressed by both super-Powers \nin an alternating fashion because of the same strategic \nconsiderations and shifting alliances.\n\nYesterday\u2019s history is too fresh in our minds to \ninduce in us any nostalgia for the Cold War. Our call \nfor reform of the United Nations is thus not influenced \nby some innate preference for the return of the old, \nbipolar configuration to replace the prevailing unipolar \nworld order. The fact is that the United Nations should \nhave undergone incremental reform and revitalization \nduring the 50 years of the Cold War. The end of the \nCold War was certainly the most auspicious moment for \nundertaking that belated task.\n\nIndeed, it is now clear in retrospect that had such \nreforms occurred then, the wars and destruction that have \nunfolded in the past 20 years could have been avoided. \nHowever, the major Powers that controlled the General \nAssembly and the various institutions and agencies \nof the United Nations, through partial hegemony, felt \nafter 1991 that they were better positioned to secure and \nconsolidate their total domination of the United Nations. \nThey blocked any reform of the United Nations, and \nso that historic opportunity for international peace and \njustice to prevail was lost.\n\nIn the past 20 years, we have witnessed excessive \ncontrol over global resources and the creation of \nspheres of influence, which has triggered international \ninstability; the use of force and coercion as primary \ninstruments for controlling global resources while \npreventing and denying others the opportunity to acquire \ncomparable military capabilities and technology; and \nthe deployment of international financial institutions, \nincluding the World Bank and the International \nMonetary Fund, in order to control the global economy, \nleading to an intractable global financial crisis with \nlethal ramifications for the majority of the peoples of \nthe world. We have also witnessed the misuse of the \nmass media and cultural centres in order to create \nfalse images and to promote decadent value systems, \nintimidate peoples and demonize any dissent; and the \nemployment of various subterfuges in order to control, \ndirectly or indirectly, all international, continental, \nregional, governmental and non-governmental bodies. \nThose manifestations of the current world order can be \ncorroborated, beyond abstract analysis, by numerous \nspecific cases and evidence related to particular events, \nplaces and time. That is precisely why the twenty-first \ncentury requires a revitalized United Nations that \ntranscends a bipolar or unipolar world order, and that \nis firmly rooted in the supremacy of, and respect for, \ninternational law and justice.\n\nAs I have intimated, Eritrea, like other African \nStates that were formed during the colonial scramble, \nshould have attained its sovereign independence during \nthe process of decolonization that transpired in the \naftermath of the Second World War. The inalienable \nnational rights of the Eritrean people were, however, \ncompromised to serve the strategic interests of the \nUnited States, which had emerged as a triumphant \nPower. Eritrea was therefore doomed to colonial rule \nby proxy. The people of Eritrea had to endure colonial \nsuppression for almost 40 years under successive \nregimes, which were propped up, alternately, by the \nUnited States for the first 23 years and by the former \nSoviet Union for the subsequent 17 years. The Eritrean \npeople had to wage their liberation struggle under those \nconditions, which exacted heavy sacrifices from them \nto achieve their independence in 1991. That historical \ntruth, coupled with other similar phenomena, illustrates \nthe perils of a world order that is driven by the rivalry \nof domineering super-Powers, and highlights the need \nand urgency for an effective United Nations.\n\nThe Eritrean people were neither compensated \nfor the transgressions meted out to them nor given \nrespite in the subsequent years. As they embarked on \nthe arduous task of rebuilding their war-torn country, \nthey again became pawns in the broader Horn of \nAfrica/Middle East chessboard of domination and \ninfluence and have suffered unjust and distorted policies \nfor the past 20 years. In that respect, border conflicts \nthat do not have political and legal justifications and \nthat were never raised prior to the independence of \n\n\n\f\nEritrea in 1991 were subtly fomented to ensnare Eritrea \nin a spiral of crises.\n\nAlthough the Boundary Commission had rendered \nits final and binding decision in 2002, the spurious \nborder conflict that erupted under the Badme rubric \ncontinued to simmer for 11 years due to obstructive \nviolations by the United States Administration. The \nEritrean people were also subjected to a sustained \nhuman trafficking campaign and illicit measures aimed \nat undermining economic growth and development, \nas well as diplomatic and propaganda campaigns of \ndemonization.\n\nGoing even further, United States officials \nimposed unlawful sanctions against Eritrea in 2009 \nthrough the Security Council. Four years on, they \ninsist on maintaining the sanctions, despite the lack of \nany evidence or justification, by relying on the widely \ndiscredited reports of the Monitoring Group on Somalia \nand Eritrea.\n\nBeyond Eritrea, the same approaches and policies \nhave exacerbated crises and further undermined \nstability, development and cooperation in Somalia and \nother parts of the Horn of Africa. Despite that massive \nhostility and in the face of tremendous odds, the people \nand Government of Eritrea have remained steadfast, \nprioritized development efforts and the improvement \nof citizens\u2019 lives, and have worked persistently to \nmake their modest contribution to regional peace and \nstability, including by fighting terrorism and piracy. \nTheir achievements, given the difficulties they faced, \nhave been remarkable, even though they fall far short \nof their aspirations.\n\nLooking forward, the people and the Government \nof Eritrea are prepared to link hands with regional and \ninternational partners, including the United Nations, \nand to work for the betterment of their country for \npeace, stability and regional integration in the Horn of \nAfrica and a fairer and more just world.\n\nThe transgressions that have been perpetrated \nagainst the people of Eritrea and other peoples in the \npast 20 years speak to the persistence of an unfair and \nunjust global order and the absence of a strong and \nrepresentative United Nations. And yet, the telltale signs \nof the advent of a new, promising era are discernible. In \nthat context, I add the voice of the Eritrean people to \nother voices in the world to urge the General Assembly \nto keep the flicker of hope alive in its current session \nand to adopt timely resolutions aimed at a fundamental \nreform of the United Nations. The fact is that the \nAssembly has legal, moral and historical obligations \nand responsibilities entrusted to it by the peoples of the \nworld that it cannot shrug off.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge the United Nations to adopt \npractical resolutions that are commensurate with its \nlegal, political and moral responsibilities in order to, \nfirst, uphold the rule of law; secondly, bring to an end \nthe invasion of our sovereign territories; thirdly, lift \nthe unlawful and harmful sanctions against Eritrea; \nfourthly, terminate interventions that jeopardize the \npeace and stability of the peoples of the Horn of Africa; \nand, fifthly, deter all acts that breed crises, loss of life \nand destruction.\n"

        "file_text": "The world in \nwhich we live is profoundly changing, but whether it \nchanges for the better is another matter. That is up to \nus. We often get the impression that great strides are \nbeing taken towards a better, more peaceful future. \nUnfortunately, reality imposes disappointing setbacks \nupon us. \n\nI recall an important step taken 150 years ago. \nIn 1863, the International Committee of the Red \nCross (ICRC) was founded in Geneva, giving rise to \na global movement. Thanks to their humanitarian \nspirit, representatives of that organization work to \nprovide humanitarian help worldwide for people \naffected by armed conflict and other violent situations. \nThe humanitarian work of the ICRC is based on the \nprinciples of neutrality, impartiality and independence. \nAll victims of conflicts receive the same treatment, and \nhelp is granted to all vulnerable persons. All human \nbeings are valued equally. \n\nAlongside the humanitarian tradition shared by \nSwitzerland and the ICRC, my country is proud of \nanother tradition dating back centuries \u2014 neutrality. \nI would recall that for centuries Switzerland\u2019s foreign \npolicy has been anchored in peaceful coexistence \namong States. Thanks to our neutrality, we maintain \nrelations with all countries. We never take sides, but \nwe can provide support or propose our mediation. \nFurthermore, our neutrality allows us to offer our good \noffices. \n\nHumanitarian engagement is part of our history. It \nis an honour for us to make our neutral soil available \nfor peace talks, and we will continue to do all we can \nto contribute towards peace in the world, in particular \nthrough our good offices. That impartial work is based \non our belief that there are differences between people \nand between nations. Those differences are natural. \nMoreover, all human beings enjoy equal rights. \n\nThe protection of human rights is a key element of \nthe Swiss commitment. Those rights are an expression \nof the obligations set out under international law and \nmust be protected. Switzerland is concerned by the \nwidespread excesses of violence and numerous human \nrights violations. It calls on all States and civilian actors \nto renounce violence. \n\nIn the Middle East, violent conflicts are imposing \nunacceptable suffering on the civil population. The \nsituation in Syria has deteriorated to such an extent that \n\n\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of \nspeeches delivered in the other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original \nlanguages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature \nof a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room \nU.506. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\n\n\n\f\nhumanitarian organizations are unable to cope. Serious \nand systematic violations and abuses of international \nhumanitarian law and human rights cannot be tolerated \nin any circumstances. Such crimes must not go \nunpunished, regardless of which side is responsible. \nThat is why my country, together with 57 like-minded \nStates, called on the Security Council in January to \nrefer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal \nCourt. The use of chemical weapons is a particularly \ndespicable crime. It is imperative to shed light on all \nfacts. With that in mind, Switzerland welcomes recent \ndevelopments. \n\nI stress the need for the international community to \nspare no effort to pave the way for another conference \nat the earliest possible date in Geneva. That conference \nshould result in a negotiated and lasting solution that \nwould take into account the legitimate aspirations of \nall Syrians.\n\nSwitzerland is not the only country bound by the \nprinciple of equal rights. The Charter of the United \nNations endows it with universal validity. The preamble \nreaffirms \u201cfaith in fundamental human rights, in the \ndignity and worth of the human person, in the equal \nrights of men and women\u201d. \n\nWhat applies to all human beings also applies to \nthe States we live in. That is why, in the same sentence, \nafter referring to the fundamental rights of all people, \nthe Charter refers explicitly to the equal rights of \nnations \u201clarge and small\u201d. Under paragraph 2 of Article \nI of the Charter, the United Nations seeks \u201cto develop \nfriendly relations among nations based on respect for \nthe principle of equal rights and self-determination of \npeoples\u201d. Paragraph 1 of Article 2 states that \n\n\u201c[t]he Organization is based on the principle of the \nsovereign equality of all its Members.\u201d\nI firmly believe that those principles are the keystone for \nthe peaceful coexistence of all people and populations \nof this world.\nBut are we still sufficiently aware of this? Or are \nwe prone to lose ourselves in grandiose ideas and minor \ndetails? I have the impression that in international \npolitics too much is said of how things should be in an \nideal world and too little about reality. I cannot help \nbut feel that excessive bureaucracy creates a kind of \nparallel universe that leads to increased isolation. At \nthe end of the day, that leads to increasingly higher \ncosts and fewer concrete results.\n\nGlobal problems need more than general discussions; \nabove all, they require a search for solutions shared by \nall parties. The United Nations was created to find such \nsolutions, and to that end it must be efficient, innovative \nand effective. Only thus will it be able to make progress \nin ensuring the equal rights of people and nations. \nSwitzerland is firmly committed to contributing to that \ntask. At present, certain developments are at odds with \nthe shared values laid down in the Charter. I would like \nto address those subjects and launch a discussion on \nthese worrisome developments.\n\nAs the representative of a neutral State with a \nlong-standing humanitarian tradition, it is with some \nconcern that I observe the growing resurgence of \npower politics. I note that large States are once again \nchoosing to exercise their power and force and that they \nview smaller States less and less as equal partners. I \nsincerely hope that this trend will be reversed as soon \nas possible. Otherwise, the fundamental values of the \nCharter, which unite the international community and \nto which its members feel committed, will be placed in \ndoubt. \n\nAs I have already said, the tendency towards \npower politics on the international stage worries me, \nfor we believe that the countries on this planet should \nbe free to choose their own futures, even as they \nrespect others States and accept the rules of peaceful \ncoexistence among peoples, without sacrificing their \nspecific character. We believe in peaceful competition \namong economies. We believe in the diversity of the \nworld \u2014 the peaceful diversity of sovereign States \nthat treat one another fairly and as equal partners. \nPeople are free to draw up their own constitutions and \nto determine their own economic order and their own \nsystem of law. No State may impose its law over that \nof another country. Problems are not solved by diktat, \nbut through negotiations. The shared norms and rules \nof international law exist to ensure that it is not simply \nthe law of the strongest that applies. The principles of \nsovereignty and equal rights provide peace and stability \nand foster friendly relations between all peoples.\n\nThose are the convictions upon which the Charter \nof the United Nations is based. Do we still share these \nconvictions today? \n\nThe way in which large nations have acted in \ndealings with small nations recently has disturbed me \nbecause I often have the impression that force has often \nbeen placed above the law. The United Nations is active \n\n\n\f\nin a vast range of areas. There is perhaps a risk that it \nhas taken on too much and lost sight of what is essential \nand concrete. The United Nations and its Member States \noften seem at a loss when the principles upon which \nthe Organization were founded are at stake. Let us \nnever forget what underlies these principles: the equal \nrights of people and the equal rights and sovereignty \nof nations. They are embodiments of the lessons of \nhistory, which has been a painful story of oppression, \nforeign domination and conflicts.\n\nTogether we must decide which path we want to \ntake. Do we want to continue squandering our strength \non issues of secondary interest? I believe that we should \nstrive, here and now, to reaffirm and live out the values \nof the United Nations. Let us commit ourselves to \nachieving a peaceful world in which people and nations \nenjoy equal rights and are of equal value \u2014 a world in \nwhich right prevails over might. It is up to all of us here \nin this Hall to do all in our power to achieve that goal. \nLet us start without delay. \n"

It should also reaffirm \nour commitment to building a more just, equitable and \nharmonious international order based on respect for \ninternational law and the principles of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations, and to upholding the sovereignty and \nthe right of each State to build its own political system, \nfree from threat, aggression or unilateral coercive \nmeasures and in an environment of peace, stability, \njustice, democracy and respect for human rights.\n\nOur Community is based on unrestricted respect \nfor international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes \nand the prohibition of the use and threat of use of force; \non respect for the self-determination, sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity of States and on non-interference in \ntheir internal affairs; on the protection and promotion \nof all human rights, the rule of law, at both the national \nand the international levels, and democracy; and on our \naim to work together for collective prosperity so as to \neradicate discrimination, inequality, marginalization, \nhuman rights violations and transgressions of the rule \nof law.\n\nWe reaffirm our region\u2019s commitment to \ninternational peace and security. We commit to \nstrengthening the climate of peace that prevails in \nLatin America and the Caribbean and to consolidating \na zone of peace that encompasses our region as a \nwhole, whereby disputes between nations are resolved \npeaceably through dialogue and negotiation or other \nmeans, in perfect harmony with international law.\n\nAt the recent High-level Meeting on Nuclear \nDisarmament (A/68/PV.11), CELAC reiterated its \nprofound concern at the threat posed to humankind \nby the continued existence of nuclear weapons and \ntheir possible use or threat of use, and the urgent need \nto make progress towards the priority objective of \nnuclear disarmament and achieve the total and absolute \nelimination of nuclear weapons. In addition, CELAC \nmember countries presented for the first time a joint \n\n\n\f\ninitiative to the Human Rights Council on the right to \npeace, which we hope will lead to a declaration on that \nright for adoption by the General Assembly.\n\nCELAC has expressed its support in the strongest \nterms for the legitimate rights of Argentina in the \ndispute over the sovereignty of the Malvinas Islands. \nThe continuing position of our region is that the United \nKingdom should agree to reopen negotiations with a \nview to finding a peaceful and definitive solution to \nthat dispute as soon as possible.\n\nOur Community reiterates its support for the \ndialogue under way between the Government of \nColombia and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias \nde Colombia, which seeks to end the internal conflict \nthat has affected the political, social and economic \ndevelopment of that sister nation for more than 50 years. \nWe hope that that initiative will succeed in reaching an \nagreement in the interests of the Colombian people.\n\nWe would also like to underscore the Latin \nAmerican and Caribbean character of Puerto Rico \nand, by taking note of the resolutions on Puerto Rico \nadopted by the Special Political and Decolonization \nCommittee, to emphasize that that issue is a matter of \ninterest to CELAC.\n\nWe reiterate our absolute condemnation of terrorism \nand reaffirm our commitment to fighting it in all its \nforms and manifestations, in keeping with the United \nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. However, \nat the same time, we strongly reject the unilateral and \nillegitimate assessments, lists and certifications made \nby some developed countries that affect countries of \nour region, in particular those referring to terrorism, \ndrug trafficking, human trafficking and other similar \nphenomena.\n\nIn recent days, as the situation in Syria has \ndeteriorated, CELAC has reiterated its vocation for \npeace and its observance of the principles enshrined in \nthe Charter of the United Nations and in international \nlaw, including international humanitarian law. It has \nurged the creation of the conditions necessary for \nmoving towards a negotiated political solution to \nthe Syrian conflict, which has claimed the lives of \nthousands of innocent people.\n\nSimilarly, CELAC is working to identify \nindependent concepts and mechanisms for cooperation, \nurging the international community to continue to \ncontribute to the reconstruction and sustainable \ndevelopment of our sister Republic of Haiti, in \naccordance with the fundamental priorities and needs \ndefined by the Haitian Government and in full respect \nfor its authority and sovereignty and the principles of \nnon-interference in the internal affairs of countries.\n\nWe have defended the sovereignty of the region, \nincluding that over our own natural resources, \nand we have expressed our solidarity with States \nmembers of CELAC in the face of harmful acts that \nviolate international law, such as that of 2 July, which \nthreatened the dignity and rights of the President of the \nPlurinational State of Bolivia, Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, \nas he returned to La Paz from a visit to a number of \nEuropean countries. \n\nTaking into account the diverse processes that \nhave shaped Latin American and Caribbean identity, \nthe Community has also emphasized its intention to \nbecome a space that protects the rights to live, thrive \nand coexist enjoyed by all cultures, races and ethnic \ngroups of the region, as well as the multicultural nature \nof our peoples and the plurinational character of some \nof our countries, especially among native communities \nthat are promoting and recreating their historical \nmemory, ancestral knowledge and their experience.\n\nAlmost seven months after he passed away, CELAC \ntoday pays a well-deserved tribute to one of its founding \nmembers, President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez Fr\u00edas, who presided \nover the founding summit of the Community with his \nvision and mastery. Similarly, CELAC expressed its \nsatisfaction over the election of Pope Francis as the \nfirst High Pontiff of the Catholic Church from the Latin \nAmerican and Caribbean region.\n\nThe global espionage against CELAC member \ncountries violates human rights, the right to privacy, the \nright of citizens to be informed, and the principles of \nState sovereignty and international law. It has become \na source of concern, and we have taken due note of the \nstatements made in various forums by Heads of States \nand Government and other leaders of Latin American \nand Caribbean countries who have condemned and \nrejected the use of such practices.\n\nThe member States of CELAC are proud of their \nshared work in consolidating our regional sovereignty so \nthat the Latin America and Caribbean region can occupy \nits rightful place in the world and renounce its status \nas the most inequal region on Earth. In pursuing these \nobjectives, we have decided to offer the most vulnerable \ncountries of the region our cooperation and solidarity \nand to draw attention to the special vulnerabilities \n\n\n\f\nof the countries of the Caribbean Community, given \ntheir status as small island developing States, which \nlimits their efforts towards sustainable development, \nespecially in light of the significant impact of natural \ndisasters and the negative effects of climate change.\n\nWith regard to the indispensable reform of the \ninternational system, we have renewed our countries\u2019 \ncommitment to multilateralism, the comprehensive \nreform of the United Nations system, and the \ndemocratization of international decision-making \nforums, in particular the Security Council. We shall act \naccordingly on issues of equal importance, among them \nthe process of formulating the post-2015 development \nagenda, which is the theme of this general debate and \nto which all CELAC member countries attach great \nimportance.\n\nThe members of CELAC know that there can be \nno lasting peace without development and without \ncombating poverty, hunger and inequality. We are \naware of the challenges that the current international \neconomic and financial crisis poses to the future of our \nregion and our legitimate aspirations to social inclusion, \nequitable growth with sustainable development, and \nintegration. We therefore emphasize the importance \nfor the post-2015 development agenda to consist of \nvoluntary, universal, clear and quantifiable goals \nthat can be adapted to distinct national realities, with \nthe purpose of eradicating poverty and promoting \nsustainable development. This new framework should \nbe inclusive and transparent on official development \nassistance, prompt the developed countries to honour \ntheir commitments, and encourage South-South and \ntriangular cooperation on cross-cutting issues through \nthe participation of all sectors of society.\n\nWith regard to climate change, we welcome the \nformal adoption of the second phase of commitments \nunder the Kyoto Protocol, despite a lack of political \nwill on the part of a number of developed nations that \nvetoed agreements on new, additional and predictable \nresources and on mechanisms for the effective transfer \nof technologies to developing countries. We will \ncontinue to work together to cope with this scourge that \naffects humankind as a whole today.\n\nThere are many difficulties, but the important \nthing is that the countries of Latin American and the \nCaribbean have come to the conclusion that the time \nhas come for the region, as Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed said, to walk in \nclose ranks, like silver in the roots of the Andes. That is \nwhy we created CELAC.\n"

        "file_text": "I am \nparticularly pleased to extend congratulations to \nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. I am indeed proud, \ngiven your stellar service to the General Assembly \nand of the service you have rendered to your native \nland, Antigua and Barbuda, and to the Latin America \nand Caribbean region in general. As a member of the \nOrganization of the Eastern Caribbean regional group \nand the wider Caribbean region, Saint Kitts and Nevis \npledges its full support to you throughout your tenure at \nthe helm of the General Assembly. I am confident that \nyour expertise and skills will position you favourably \nto guide the general debate and the extensive work \nprogramme of the various committees and agencies of \nthis body.\n\nSir, Saint Kitts and Nevis wishes to place on record \nits appreciation to your predecessor, the President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, Mr. Vuk \nJeremi., for the important contributions that he made \nto advance the work of the institution during his own \ntenure.\n\nWe begin the sixty-eighth session fully cognizant \nof the diverse challenges with which we must contend, \nand equally seized of our obligation as a Government \nand people to contribute to the global priorities that \ninform the work of the Assembly. We see the relevance \nof maintaining sharp focus on those areas that are quite \nintegral to the national and international development \nagendas. I refer to matters such as sustainable \ndevelopment, the maintenance of international peace and \nsecurity, the promotion of human rights, disarmament, \nthe promotion of justice and international law, and \nthe effective coordination of humanitarian assistance \nefforts. Those, we believe, are the core principles for \ninforming any plan of action to advance towards the \npost-2015 era with the confidence that our shared vision \nfor meeting the goals we set, will be realized.\n\nJust a few days ago, Saint Kitts and Nevis \nattained another milestone, celebrating three decades \nof nationhood with a very strong commitment to \nmaintaining the stability and prosperity of our nation, \ndrawing on our own creativity as a Government and \na people. Therefore, this year\u2019s statement is very \nsignificant for our proud nation. As one of the smallest \nStates Members of the Organization in the western \nhemisphere, we are pleased with the significant strides \nthat we have made as my Government pursues a process \nof transformation for sustainability in a nation that is \nnot immune to global developments that continue to \nhave a negative impact on its national agenda.\n\nHowever, my Government is working assiduously \nto transform our former sugar-based economy into one \nthat is service-oriented, driven mainly by tourism and \nhospitality and supported by international financial and \noffshore education services and by manufacturing and \nagriculture. In all of this, we are aware of the momentum \nand impact of information and communication \ntechnology as a tool that will assist us in developing \nour national economy.\n\nAs far as the manufacturing sector is concerned, \nwe have developed a cluster of light manufacturing \n\n\n\f\nenterprises that service the North and South American \nand European markets with quality electronic and \nelectrical components for construction, cable television, \nand the aerospace and aircraft industries. Indeed, our \npresent economic trajectory will ensure that we meet \nboth the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and \nour own sustainable development goals in the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda. That is why the theme for this \nsession \u2014 \u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: setting \nthe stage\u201d \u2014 is perceived to be quite relevant.\n\nMy delegation is pleased that at this session we will \nbe reviewing the progress made towards achieving the \nMDGs as the target date of 2015 fast approaches. In that \nregard, the Secretary-General must be commended for \nhis initiative. I am pleased to indicate that Saint Kitts \nand Nevis has taken tremendous strides in achieving the \nMDG 1, concerning the eradication of extreme poverty. \nOur Government has invested heavily in creating a \nvery solid and expansive social safety infrastructure \nthat has helped the less fortunate to lead dignified \nlives. We provide subsidized health care for children \nand the elderly. We assist vulnerable families with the \nresources to pursue education and provide them with \nhot, nourishing meals each day. We also provide living \nfacilities for the aged and the indigent.\n\nMy delegation hopes that every effort will be \nmade globally to ensure that all targets are met by the \nindicative 2015 deadline. The Millennium Development \nGoals Report 2013 provides a clear indication of exactly \nwhere the international community should be directing \nits focus. The world as a whole has to pay a great deal of \nattention to the MDGs that are most off track, and those \nwhere progress has stalled, including those relating to \nhunger, universal access to primary education, child \nmortality, maternal health and access to sanitation. All \nnations must therefore redouble their efforts to exercise \nthe requisite political will to implement programmes \ndesigned especially to meet the established targets \nand to improve the lives of millions of people in a \nmeaningful way.\n\nWe must never lose sight of the intrinsic linkages \nthat exist between the Millennium Development Goals \nand the sustainable development goals, particularly in \nthe post-2015 development agenda. Both processes, \nthough running in parallel, are mutually reinforcing in \nthe sense that the latter will accelerate programmes to \nmeet target indicators in the former, while the former \nwill provide valuable lessons for achieving a higher \ndegree of overall success.\n\nCognizant of the fact that poverty eradication \nis intrinsically linked to attaining sustainable \ndevelopment, we must strive to ensure that a balanced \napproach is taken to blending economic growth, equity, \nsocial inclusion and environmental sustainability as we \ncraft and implement policies to achieve development \nthat is both meaningful and truly sustainable. The \npost-2015 development agenda must be arrived at \nthrough transparent and inclusive intergovernmental \nnegotiations under the United Nations. In that regard, \nmy delegation appreciates the decision taken at the \nspecial event on the follow-up to achieving the MDGs \nthat was convened earlier this week.\n\nThe post-2015 development agenda should also \naddress other challenges faced by developing countries, \nsuch as universal access to modern energy services, \nensuring food security and nutrition, providing full and \nproductive employment and decent work for all, job \nskills and training, agricultural development, building \nproductive capacity, and infrastructure development. \nMy Government has seen the positive impact of its own \nnational initiative, which is geared towards providing \nyoung people in particular with the skills they need to \nintegrate themselves into the world of work through the \nPeople Empowerment Programme. To date, over 2,000 \nyoung men and women have reaped the benefits of this \nparticular initiative.\n\nIt is very important for all States Members of \nthis great Organization to play an active role in \nensuring that the targets identified in the post-2015 era \nadequately address the remaining gaps by the indicative \ndeadline for achieving the MDGs. My delegation \nwould therefore wish to reaffirm its commitment to \nensuring that small island developing States remain \na special case for ensuring sustainable development, \nrecognizing our unique characteristics, our challenges \nand vulnerabilities, and their ongoing impact on our \nability to achieve and build resilience. Small island \ndeveloping States remain constrained in meeting the \neconomic, environmental and social challenges they \nface. While we recognize our own responsibility for \novercoming some of these setbacks, we wish to stress \nthat in the absence of cooperation and assistance from \nthe international community, success will definitely \nremain difficult.\n\nAt this juncture, allow me to place on record our \nappreciation to some of our development partners \nthat have offered us tangible assistance in stabilizing \nour national economy and in generally diversifying \n\n\n\f\nthe national economy, in particular in the field \nof agricultural diversification, information and \ncommunications technologies, development and energy \ndiversification in an economy that relies on fossil-fuel \nconsumption. This phenomenon will have a positive \nimpact on our energy cost-reduction efforts as we \nadvance towards realizing our goal of a fully green \neconomy as we endeavour to bring much-needed relief \nto our people by 2015.\n\nThe contributions of the Governments of the \nRepublic of China, Japan, the United States of America, \nVenezuela, the United Kingdom, Canada and Cuba, and \nof the Organization of American States, the European \nUnion, the International Monetary Fund and the World \nBank in particular, have assisted greatly in that regard.\n\nThe Assembly will agree that no discussion of the \nissue of development can progress without reference \nto the area of health, and in particular the chronic \nillnesses that continue to plague our societies resulting \nin the loss of lives, thus retarding our developmental \nthrust. It was just a few days ago, in the margins of \nthe sixty-eighth session, that I had the privilege of \naddressing a forum on non-communicable diseases and \ndisability, held in collaboration with several permanent \nmissions, the Caribbean Community secretariat, the \nPan American Health Organization (PAHO), the World \nHealth Organization and the Non-Communicable \nDisease Alliance. The forum was designed to bring \nfocused attention to creating synergies between \nnon-communicable diseases (NCDs) and disabilities \nand to examine how health systems can be reoriented \nand reinforced to ensure equitable access to high-\nquality care and thereby advance development.\n\nIn that forum, we were able to confirm that NCDs \nare driven not only by ageing but increasingly and \nalarmingly by the growing number of cases of juvenile \ndiabetes and the growing number of youth incapacitated \nby accident injury. The high incidence of NCDs within \nthe Caribbean also places an increased burden on our \nopen economies, which are highly vulnerable to external \nshocks and natural disasters, diverting resources that \ncould be allocated to building quality infrastructure \nand our precious human capital. Indeed, we accept \nthe recommendation of the report of the Caribbean \nCommission on Health and Development that urgent \nsteps must be taken to reverse those particular trends.\n\nTherefore, as we focus strategically on the \nMillennium Development Goals and the post-\n2015 development agenda, we cannot lose sight of \nnon-communicable diseases and the real threat that \nthey pose to societies across the globe. We are therefore \ngrateful for the attention that was given at the United \nNations High-level Meeting on the Prevention and \nControl of Non-communicable Diseases two years ago \nto the need for a global response to that problem. We \nrecognize that much work has been undertaken by the \nWorld Health Organization, the Pan American Health \nOrganization and other regional bodies to reverse the \nhigh incidence of NCDs in our region. There is now \na strong emphasis on testing, since the collection of \nempirical data is key for proper tracking and analysis. \nThe preparation of strategic plans and budgets and \nthe incorporation of families and communities into \neducation, prevention and detection programmes are \nall pivotal in this regard.\n\nMy delegation is convinced that the combat against \nthe high incidence of non-communicable diseases must \nreceive greater prominence in the post-2015 sustainable \ndevelopment agenda. It is evident that there is a strong \nnexus between a nation\u2019s health status and its levels \nof productivity. My delegation therefore subscribes to \nthe notion that a nation\u2019s wealth lies in the health of its \npeople. Our High-level Meeting of two years ago was \nan important first step in that regard, and it is one on \nwhich we must continue to build on an ongoing basis. \nIt is clear that we need to adopt a strategy similar to \nthe global response to HIV/AIDS in order to achieve \nthe levels of success in fighting the incidence of NCDs.\n\nToday, I respectfully submit that there are practical \nlessons to be learned from the experience developed by \nagencies such as the Joint United Nations Programme \non HIV/AIDS and PAHO that have touched the lives of \nmillions in a positive way. It is therefore important for \nthe Assembly to keep on the front burner a practical \nstrategy to address the high incidence of NCDs within \nour region and the nations of the world.\n\nAs we usher in a dispensation of sustainment, \nwe remain cognizant of the inextricable link between \ndevelopment and an environment of peace and security. \nCrime in any society is an unwelcome and destabilizing \nthreat that must be dealt with promptly. Indeed, the \nways in which societies are affected at both the micro \nand the macro levels are known to us all. Entire \nsocieties are forced to bear the myriad costs associated \nwith personal injury, psychological insecurity and the \nrelated health-care repercussions.\n\nThat is why we in Saint Kitts and Nevis have placed \ngreat emphasis on effective leadership, clear lines \n\n\n\f\nof authority and responsibility, targeted equipment \nupgrades, expanded and ongoing training, community \npolicing, strengthened relations between the police and \nthe public, and full cooperation at all levels between \nour national police force and our national defence force. \nAs a result, Saint Kitts and Nevis has made tremendous \nstrides in confronting the challenge of crime. Indeed, \nin the space of just over one year, we were able to see \ncrime plummet by some 53 per cent, convincing us of \nthe importance of the United Nations providing a forum \nvia which Member States might share best practices \nin this era of globalized criminality. If the challenge \nis becoming international in scope, so too must our \nresponse.\n\nIn that regard, we are equally aware that the \nsocioeconomic and political gains that we are trying \nto achieve in the global community will be elusive if \nthe environment of peace is interrupted by warfare \nand threats to the peaceful coexistence of the world\u2019s \npeoples. Saint Kitts and Nevis therefore joins in \ncondemning the atrocities that have recently been \nperpetrated in Syria and Kenya, which have resulted in \nwanton loss of human lives. Such use of chemical and \nconventional weapons, resort to acts of violence and \nterrorism, and their spiralling inhumane effects will \nultimately have a far-reaching deleterious impact on \nglobal safety and security, which must continue to be a \nconcern for all of the world\u2019s leaders and their peoples.\n\nMore than any other time in its history, the United \nNations must be more assertive in executing its mandate \nas a leading actor in securing world peace. Saint Kitts \nand Nevis appreciates the strides that we have made with \nthe Arms Trade Treaty, and would urge that we move \nwith alacrity to ensure its entry into force. However, \nas a small island State with open borders, we see the \nrelevance of establishing international standards and \ncontrols that will govern the illicit flow of small arms \nand light weapons through our Caribbean ports.\n\nWe commend the United States of America for the \npartnership that has been forged with Saint Kitts and \nNevis and the other States Members of the Caribbean \nthat form part of the United States Caribbean Basin \nSecurity Initiative, which, among other things, will be \npivotal to our efforts to stop the illicit flow of foreign-\nmade small arms into our peaceful Caribbean region. \nThis initiative has provided avenues of collaboration in \ncrime prevention and detection as we work together in \nbuilding the capacity of our security forces. This, we \nare convinced, will contribute significantly to creating \nan enabling environment for sustainable development \nthrough the prevalence of peace and security in our \ncommunities.\n\nOur focus is not only on the international \ndimensions of crime. Indeed, we are mindful of the fact \nthat all over the world, women and children are among \nthe most vulnerable in our societies, and so we have \ninstituted a clear and assertive zero-tolerance policy in \nthis regard. Violence against women and children must \nbe seen not as a personal or family matter, but instead \nas a socially destructive behaviour demanding judicial \nintervention. If and where this zero-tolerance policy \ndoes not yet exist, we strongly urge its embrace today \nand its immediate implementation.\n\nThirty years ago, Saint Kitts and Nevis established \ndiplomatic relations with several countries, including \nthe Republic of China on Taiwan. In the intervening \nyears, this relationship has been mutually beneficial. \nAs the debate on sustainable development unfolds, \nSaint Kitts and Nevis is eminently qualified to speak \non the myriad contributions that the Republic of China \nis capable of making to the international community. \nWhile the international community is preoccupied with \nensuring peace and security globally, we can applaud \nthe Government of the Republic of China for promoting \npeace across the Taiwan Strait and proposing the East \nChina Sea Peace Initiative, thereby demonstrating a \ncommitment to peace and stability.\n\nTaiwan is one of the top 18 economies globally. In \naddition, Taiwan has worked assiduously to advance \nthe economic interests of countries such as ours. In \nthis regard, we have collaborated on a large number \nof key projects, such as the multisectoral agritourism \ndemonstration farm, our high-priority solar energy farm \nand an information and communications technology \ncentre, which are all designed to advance the social and \neconomic interests of my small nation.\n\nI wish to place on record my delegation\u2019s \nappreciation to the World Health Organization for \nhaving invited Taiwan, for five consecutive years, \nto attend the World Health Assembly (WHA) as an \nobserver. We are of the view that Taiwan has adopted a \nvery pragmatic approach to its meaningful participation \nin United Nations specialized agencies and functional \norganizations that are critical to the current global \nefforts to address many issues of mutual concern. My \ndelegation is convinced that the arrangements made \nfor Taiwan\u2019s presence in the World Health Assembly, \nwhich have been referred to as the WHA model, serve \n\n\n\f\nas a useful point of reference for Taiwan\u2019s meaningful \nparticipation in other international agencies, such as \nthe International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) \nand the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change. While on that note, permit me to \ncommend Mr. Roberto Kobeh Gonz\u00e1lez, President of \nthe ICAO Council, on the decision to invite Taiwan to \nattend this month\u2019s thirty-eighth ICAO Assembly as a \nspecial guest.\n\nGermane to the concept of exclusion from the \ninternational trading arrangement is the trade embargo \nimposed on Cuba at the height of the Cold War, which \ntoday remains a matter of concern for Saint Kitts \nand Nevis, as it does to the vast majority of nations \nrepresented in this important institution. Our own \nposition is based on our commitment to international \nlaw, the principles of the Charter of the United Nations \nand our obligations under the same. We therefore, \nlike so many in this Hall, are concerned about the \nextraterritorial application and effects of national \nlegislation on the sovereignty of States. Therefore, \nthe Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis reiterates its \nsupport for resolution 67/4 on the necessity of ending \nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo \nimposed by the United States of America against Cuba, \nand once again calls for an immediate end to that \nunilateral action.\n\nAs we move to open a chapter that will usher in a \nmore enlightened era of human existence, Saint Kitts and \nNevis joins with the States members of the Caribbean \nCommunity in supporting the very important case for \nreparations associated with the atrocities of slavery. \nAlthough the repercussions of slavery on the lives of our \nancestors cannot be quantified, we are convinced that \nthe deleterious effects, which even now are translated \ninto much hardship and poverty for the descendants of \nour ancestors, must be resolved. Therefore, the time has \ncome.\n\nThe world has seen more than its share of conflicts \nin recent years. In addition, natural disasters, sometimes \ncaused by climate change, continue to wreak havoc \nin many corners of the globe. All of this speaks to \nthe importance of us marshalling and managing very \ncarefully those resources that have been placed under \nour respective control for the benefit of the people we \nrepresent. It speaks to the importance of us being far \nmore responsible stewards of this planet than we have \nbeen in the past. It speaks to our working assiduously, \nwhenever we can, to abate tensions and promote peace.\n\nThere can be change in 2015 only as long as we \ndo not fail to take a bold and definitive stance in \naddressing the ills that stymie our efforts to move \nforward in achieving our goals. There will be change in \n2015 if we do not fail to pursue the priorities that will \neradicate poverty, enhance global peace and security, \nfind alternative means of reducing the impact of climate \nchange and saving our planet from destruction, and \nreduce elevated incidences of HIV/AIDS and NCDs. \nThere must be change in 2015 if the agencies of the \nOrganization adopt a policy of equity and the strong \ndetermination to execute their mandate to enable the \ninstitutionalization of a culture of peace and security, \nrespect for human lives and justice for all.\n\nLet us therefore, today and forever, commit to rising \nto the challenge and moving forward, imbued with a \nrenewed sense of focus, determination and urgency to \nfulfil our goals. May all that we say here bring us closer \nto that most vital and crucial of ends.\n"

        "file_text": "The \nRepublic of Vanuatu is honoured to participate in \nthis debate under your presidency, Sir, and we wish \nto associate ourselves with all other delegations in \ncongratulating you and the members of your Bureau \non your election to lead us through this sixty-eighth \nsession of the General Assembly.\n\nOn Syria, we have seen internal conflicts transformed \ninto international disputes that require solutions from \nthis body. During this session, there has been intensive \ndebate on the protracted conflict affecting the Syrian \npeople and undermining regional and international \npeace. We join many other peace-loving nations to call \nfor an end to the conflict and for the United Nations to \ndo more strongly to enforce the international ban on the \nuse of chemical weapons. We also urge the United States \nof America and the Russian Federation to take a strong \nleading role in the issue of Syria and in addressing the \nchemical-weapons issue there.\n\nWe are concerned at the fact that that such conflicts \nhave often diverted the international focus from \naddressing much more important issues, such as our \ncommon aspirations for the Millennium Development \nGoals. It is unfair that countries resorting to such \nillegitimate acts can trigger wars that cost a great deal \nof money, whereas the rest of the peace-loving countries \nand their peoples suffer the consequences, as the monies \nspent could be diverted to better and effective use.\n\nIt is here, from this rostrum, that the leaders of our \nnations have spoken out freely, from their hearts, in an \nendeavour to find common solutions so as to inspire the \ncommunity of nations committed to international peace \nand security. Our main objectives are to take collective \ndecisions so as to address a spectrum of international \nissues, some of which require urgent action, such as the \nissue of climate change. It is here that we have called \nfor the recognition of the rights of women, children and \npersons with disabilities who are caught up in conflicts \nand violence. It is here that we have called for help for \nthose who have been discriminated against because of \ntheir colour, their religion or their political convictions.\n\nFor the Republic of Vanuatu, this rostrum is the \nonly international platform from which, year after year \nsince 1981, we have spoken out against colonialism \nand neo-imperialism in all its forms. Today once \nagain, I speak on behalf of the entire population of our \narchipelago to be the voice of those who still live in \ncolonized territories. \n\nWe know that decolonization is still incomplete. \nHowever, we have seen the Special Political and \nDecolonization Committee (Fourth Committee) take \nmore and more positive steps during its 2013 sessions, \nrecognizing the inalienable right of French Polynesia \nto self-determination. We also applaud the work of the \nCommittee in continuing discussions and dialogue on \nthe question of New Caledonia. \n\nAllow me at this juncture to thank the Government of \nFrance for its cooperation in moving the decolonization \nprocess forward. It is important to maintain this \ndialogue with the specific goal of helping the Kanak \npeople to attain their independence. With the greatest \npossible respect, I encourage all parties to ensure that \nthe process of achieving freedom remains on track. We \nin the Melanesian Spearhead Group are appreciative of \nthe work of the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation \nFront as chair of the Group.\n\nThe Republic of Vanuatu has just emerged from \ncolonialism, having achieved its political independence \nfrom the Powers of the British-French condominium \n33 years ago. Based on our struggle for independence, \nwe share the journey and the litany of heartaches and \ndreams of many of our brothers and sisters whose rights \nto political and civil freedom are still held back by the \ntentacles of imperialism and colonialism.\n\nI would like to reiterate today our appeal launched \nlast year from this rostrum that the Secretariat should \nalways remain impartial and avoid any selective \nimplementation of General Assembly and Security \nCouncil resolutions on the rights of all people who \ndesire to be free from colonialism or any form of \nimperialism.\n\nWe can debate issues of terrorism, financial and \neconomic crises and climate change and reach some \nlevel of understanding of the seriousness of those \nchallenges and the measures that must be taken to \naddress them. We can talk of good governance and the \nrule of law and respect for human rights. But when it \ncomes to the issue of the rights of the people of West \nPapua, our voices fall silent, even from this rostrum. \n\nI wish to congratulate the Secretary-General, \nMr. Ban Ki-moon, who, when he visited Asia in \n2012, emphasized that the United Nations would do \n\n\n\f\neverything possible to ensure that human rights are \nrespected in West Papua, saying \n\n\u201cwhether you are an independent State or a non-self-\ngoverning territory or whatever, [that] human right \nis inalienable and a fundamental principle of the \nUnited Nations\u201d. \nNow, as Members of the United Nations, we must \ncall for those words to be translated into action. \n\nMy Government calls upon the United Nations to \nappoint a special representative to investigate alleged \nhuman rights violations in West Papua and its political \nstatus in the light of the controversies surrounding the \nadministration established in the 1960s, the United \nNations Temporary Executive Authority. Ever since the \ncontroversial Act of Free Choice, the West Papuans have \nalways been consistently denied any sort of recognition \nby the United Nations. It is clear from many historical \nrecords that the Melanesian people of West Papua were \nthe scapegoats of Cold War politics and were sacrificed \nto gratify the appetite for the natural resources that the \ncountry possesses. Today, they are still victims of the \nignorance of the United Nations.\n\nIf the United Nations representative at the time, \nMr. Fernando Ortiz-Sanz, described the West Papuan \nissue as a cancer growing on the side of the United \nNations and that it was his job to remove it, it is very \nclear today from what we have observed that that cancer \nhas never been removed, but merely concealed. One day \nit will have to be treated. We must not be afraid. The \nUnited Nations has made mistakes in the past. We must \nadmit our mistakes and see that we are the stronger for \nthat, because when we are weak, admit our mistakes \nand take corrective action, we become stronger and \nmore alive. \n\nAs Members of the United Nations, we all subscribe \nto the principles of democracy, good governance, human \nrights, accountability and the rule of law enshrined in \nthe United Nations Charter. In this age of technology, \nwhen nothing can escape the attention of civil society \nand Governments, I ask how then can we ignore the \nhundreds of thousands of West Papuans who have been \nbrutally beaten and murdered?\n\nThe people of West Papua are looking to the United \nNations as a beacon of hope. We are now deliberating \non the issue of Syria. In that same spirit, I would ask \nthat my fellow leaders express support for West Papua. \nIt is time for the United Nations to move beyond its \nlimits and take action to rectify the errors of the past. \n\nSince our independence 33 years ago, the indigenous \npeoples of my country have remained concerned that a \npart of our maritime and cultural jurisdiction, including \nthe islands of Umaepnune and Leka, situated south of \nVanuatu, are still occupied by France. Thus, the people \nof our country are denied the right to the exercise of \nfull political freedom and their inherent cultural rights. \nThe indigenous peoples of the southern province of \nour country cannot, therefore, fulfil their obligations \nto protect their culture and traditions that bind them \nto the sovereign land that has been theirs since time \nimmemorial.\n\nThose two islands are of paramount importance, \nbecause they form the basis for the establishment of \nour unique cultural framework, which brings together \nour cultural island group known as the Tafea Islands. \nIt is that cultural framework that governed us and \ndefined our identity and our way of life long before \nadministrative colonial Powers began to explore and \ngovern our shores. \n\nUnfortunately, today, our indigenous peoples \ncontinue to be denied access to those sacred and \ncultural islands. My Government therefore calls on \nthe community of nations meeting in the Assembly \nto uphold the principles of the respect of the rights of \nour indigenous peoples and their way of life. Further, \nwe call upon the French Government to allow our \nindigenous people of Tafea to have access to the land \nof their forefathers, the islands Umaenupne and Leka in \nthe south of the Republic of Vanuatu. \n\nThe call by the United Nations to review the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to \nstrategize a post-2015 development agenda compels \nus to rethink our global partnership structures and \nour national priorities in order to better achieve our \ngoals in the period after 2015. My country has made \nsome progress in achieving some of the MDG targets. \nHowever, the appropriate conditions for economic \ngrowth and development must be created. An integrated \nand balanced approach is required to deal adequately \nwith the social, economic and environmental \ndimensions. \n\nTo that end, my Government has placed emphasis on \nclimate change, renewable energy and the sustainable \nuse of the environment. We have now created a separate \nMinistry focusing on adaptation to climate change, \n\n\n\f\nenergy and the environment so that the Government \ncan address issues in that area. We would therefore \nwelcome opportunities for unconditional partnerships \nin order to better address those issues. \n\nIt is clear that there has been much debate on the \nissue of climate change. However, the level to which \nfinal pledges have been met has been unsatisfactory, \nconsidering the fast pace at which climate change is \nhaving an impact on small island developing States. We \ncall for more urgent action and decisions on that front.\n\nWhile Vanuatu supports the shift in the development \nparadigm, we also recognize that the new development \nagenda might harbour its own shortcomings and must \ntherefore be given careful consideration when it comes \nto its final design. It is evident that the new approach \nmust take heed of, first, the complexity that still exists \nwithin international aid programmes for development, \ncoupled with the risk of unpredictable financial crises \nthat can affect the delivery of aid; secondly, the \nchallenges faced by countries at present in attaining \nthe MDGs; thirdly, the ambiguities and difficulties \ninvolved in setting the priority of goals within an \nexpanded list of priorities; fourthly, the imminent \ngraduation of my country from least developed country \nstatus and the benefits accompanying that change; and \nfifthly, the risk of a reduced level of real aid spending \nper capita affected partly by a failure to increase global \naid for development.\n\nAware of those issues, Vanuatu has taken measures, \npartly on its own and with the assistance of its partners, \nto ensure greater resilience to its own vulnerabilities. \nOur plan involves taking decisions that lead to quantum \nleaps in the development of our country\u2019s infrastructure \nin which ports, roads and airports will be built and \nupgraded to facilitate, inter alia, the large-scale \nintegration of the rural population into the national \neconomy. \n\nI would like to thank the Governments of China, \nAustralia and New Zealand and the Asian Development \nBank for their assistance, as well as the Government \nof the United States for its enormous investment in \nthe two major national highways in Vanuatu. We see \nthat as an investment in the future of my country, \nwhere 60 per cent of the population is aged 25 years or \nunder, whereby most of the rural population will gain \ngreater access to markets and economic opportunities \nthroughout the archipelago\u2019s islands.\n\nAll our development initiatives must be inclusive \nand not ignore the poor and the marginalized. My \ncountry has taken the measures necessary to ensure \ngender equality and the empowerment of women. The \nGovernment\u2019s measures include legislation amending \nlaws on sexual discrimination, addressing issues of \ndomestic violence and the submission of universal \nperiodic reports to ensure compliance with the reporting \nframework of the Human Rights Council. \n\nIn conclusion, I wish to thank you once again, \nMr. President, for giving me the opportunity to express \nmy views in this forum. We have spoken a great deal \nabout many things, and we now must translate our \nwords into action. Long live our aspirations for a better \nand more secure world for everyone!\n"

        "file_text": "I feel deeply honoured and \nprivileged to stand here before the General Assembly \ntoday representing the citizens of the State of Israel. \nWe are an ancient people. We date back nearly 4,000 \nyears to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. We have journeyed \nthrough time. We have overcome the greatest of \nadversities. And we re-established our sovereign State \nin our ancestral homeland, the land of Israel. The Jewish \npeople\u2019s odyssey through time has taught us two things: \nnever give up hope and always remain vigilant. Hope \ncharts the future, vigilance protects it.\n\nToday our hope for the future is challenged by a \nnuclear-armed Iran that seeks our destruction. But I \nwant members to know that that was not always the case. \nSome 2,500 years ago, the great Persian King Cyrus \nended the Babylonian exile of the Jewish people. He \nissued a famous edict in which he proclaimed the right \nof the Jews to return to the land of Israel and rebuild the \nJewish Temple in Jerusalem. That is a Persian decree, \nand thus began a historic friendship between the Jews \nand the Persians that lasted until modern times.\n\nBut, in 1979, a radical regime in Tehran tried to \nstamp out that friendship. As it was busy crushing \nthe Iranian people\u2019s hopes for democracy, it also led \nwild chants of \u201cDeath to the Jews!\u201d Since that time, \npresidents of Iran have come and gone. Some presidents \nwere considered moderates, others hard-liners. But \nthey have all served that same unforgiving creed, that \nsame unforgiving regime \u2014 that creed that is espoused \nand enforced by the real power in Iran, the dictator \nknown in Iran as the Supreme Leader, first Ayatollah \nKhomeini and now Ayatollah Khamenei.\n\nPresident Rouhani, like the presidents who came \nbefore him, is a loyal servant of the regime. He was \none of only six candidates the regime permitted to run \nfor office. Nearly 700 other candidates were rejected. \nWhat made him acceptable? Rouhani headed Iran\u2019s \nSupreme National Security Council from 1989 through \n2003. During that time, Iran\u2019s henchmen gunned \ndown opposition leaders in a Berlin restaurant. They \nmurdered 85 people at the Jewish community centre \nin Buenos Aires. They killed 19 American soldiers by \nblowing up the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia. Are we \nto believe that Rouhani, the national security adviser \nof Iran at the time, knew nothing about those attacks? \nOf course he did \u2014 just as 30 years ago Iran\u2019s security \nchiefs knew about the bombings in Beirut that killed \n241 American marines and 58 French paratroopers.\n\nRouhani was also Iran\u2019s chief nuclear negotiator \nbetween 2003 and 2005. He masterminded the strategy \nthat enabled Iran to advance its nuclear-weapons \nprogramme behind a smokescreen of diplomatic \nengagement and very soothing rhetoric. I know that \nRouhani does not sound like Ahmadinejad. But when it \ncomes to Iran\u2019s nuclear-weapons programme, the only \ndifference between them is this: Ahmadinejad was a \nwolf in wolf\u2019s clothing, Rouhani is a wolf in sheep\u2019s \nclothing \u2014 a wolf who thinks he can pull the wool over \nthe eyes of the international community.\n\nLike everyone else, I wish we could believe \nRouhani\u2019s words, but we must focus on Iran\u2019s actions. \nAnd it is the brazen contrast \u2014 that extraordinary \ncontradiction between Rouhani\u2019s words and Iran\u2019s \nactions \u2014 that is so startling. Rouhani stood at this very \nrostrum last week and praised Iranian democracy (see \nA/68/PV.6). Iranian democracy, he said. But the regime \nthat he represents executes political dissidents by the \nhundreds and jails them by the thousands. Rouhani \nspoke of \u201cthe human tragedy in Syria\u201d. Yet Iran directly \nparticipates in Al-Assad\u2019s murder and massacre of tens \nof thousands of innocent men, women and children in \nSyria, and that regime is propping up a Syrian regime \nthat just used chemical weapons against its own people. \nRouhani condemned the \u201cviolent scourge\u201d of terrorism. \nYet in the past three years alone Iran has ordered, \nplanned or perpetrated terrorist attacks in 25 cities \non five continents. Rouhani denounced \u201cattempts to \nchange the regional balance through proxies\u201d. Yet Iran \nis actively destabilizing Lebanon, Yemen, Bahrain and \nmany other Middle Eastern countries. Rouhani promises \n\u201cconstructive engagement with other countries\u201d. Yet \ntwo years ago, Iranian agents tried to assassinate Saudi \nArabia\u2019s Ambassador in Washington, D.C. Just three \nweeks ago, an Iranian agent was arrested while trying \nto collect information for possible attacks against the \nAmerican Embassy in Tel Aviv. Some constructive \nengagement!\n\nI wish I could be moved by Rouhani\u2019s invitation \nto join his \u201cWAVE\u201d \u2014 a world against violence and \nextremism. Yet the only waves Iran has generated in the \npast 30 years are waves of violence and terrorism that \nit has unleashed on the region and across the world. I \nwish I could believe Rouhani, but I do not because facts \nare stubborn things. The facts are that Iran\u2019s savage \n\n\n\f\nrecord flatly contradicts Rouhani\u2019s soothing rhetoric. \nLast Friday, Rouhani assured us that in pursuit of its \nnuclear programme, Iran had \u201cnever chosen deceit and \nsecrecy.\u201d Never chosen deceit and secrecy?\n\nIn 2002, Iran was caught red-handed secretly \nbuilding an underground centrifuge facility at Natanz. \nIn 2009, Iran was again caught red-handed secretly \nbuilding a huge underground nuclear facility for \nuranium enrichment in a mountain near Qom. Rouhani \ntells us not to worry. He assures us that all that is not \nintended for nuclear weapons. Does any here believe \nthat? If so, here are a few questions to ask.\n\nWhy would a country that claims to only want \npeaceful nuclear energy build hidden underground \nenrichment facilities? Why would a country with vast \nnatural energy reserves invest billions in developing \nnuclear energy? Why would a country intent on merely \nhaving civilian nuclear programmes continue to defy \nmultiple Security Council resolutions and incur the costs \nof crippling sanctions on its economy? And why would \na country with a peaceful nuclear programme develop \nintercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) whose sole \npurpose is to deliver nuclear warheads? You do not build \nICBMs to carry TNT thousands of miles away. You \nbuild them for one purpose: to carry nuclear warheads. \nIran is now building ICBMs that the United States says \ncould reach this city in three or four years.\n\nWhy would they do all that? The answer is simple. \nIran is not building a peaceful nuclear programme. \nIran is developing nuclear weapons. Last year alone, \nIran enriched three tons of uranium to 3.5 per cent, \ndoubled its stockpile of 20 per cent-enriched uranium \nand added thousands of new centrifuges, including \nadvanced centrifuges. It also continued work on the \nheavy-water reactor in Arak in order to have another \nroute to the bomb \u2014 a plutonium path. Since Rouhani\u2019s \nelection \u2014 and I stress this \u2014 that vast and feverish \neffort has continued unabated.\n\nUnderground nuclear facilities? Heavy water \nreactors? Advanced centrifuges? ICBMs? It is not that it \nis hard to find evidence that Iran has a nuclear-weapons \nprogramme; it is hard to find evidence that Iran does not \nhave a nuclear-weapons programme. Last year, when \nI spoke here at the United Nations (see A/67/PV.12), I \ndrew a red line. Iran has been very careful not to cross \nthat line. But Iran is positioning itself to race across that \nline in future, at a time of its choosing. Iran wants to \nbe in a position to rush forward to build nuclear bombs \nbefore the international community can detect it, much \nless prevent it. Yet Iran faces one big problem, and that \nproblem is summed up in one word: sanctions.\n\nI have argued for many years, including from \nthis rostrum, that the only way to peacefully prevent \nIran from developing nuclear weapons is to combine \ntough sanctions with a credible military threat. That \npolicy is today bearing fruit. Thanks to the efforts of \nmany countries, many represented here, and under the \nleadership of the United States, tough sanctions have \ntaken a big bite out of Iran\u2019s economy. Oil revenues \nhave fallen. The currency has plummeted. Banks are \nhard pressed to transfer money. As a result, the regime \nis under intense pressure from the Iranian people to get \nthe sanctions removed. That is why Rouhani got elected \nin the first place. That is why he launched his charm \noffensive. He definitely wants to get the sanctions \nlifted \u2014 I guarantee the Assembly that \u2014 but he does \nnot want to give up Iran\u2019s nuclear-weapons programme \nin return.\n\nHere is the strategy to achieve that: first, smile a lot. \nSmiling never hurts. Secondly, pay lip service to peace, \ndemocracy and tolerance. Thirdly, offer meaningless \nconcessions in exchange for lifting sanctions. Fourthly, \nand most important, ensure that Iran retains sufficient \nnuclear material and sufficient nuclear infrastructure \nto race to the bomb at a time that it chooses to do so. \nWhy does Rouhani think he can get away with that? \nThis is a ruse, a ploy. Why does Rouhani think he can \nget away with that? Because he has gotten away with it \nbefore. Because his strategy of talking a lot and doing \nlittle has worked for him in the past. He even brags \nabout it. Here is what he said in his 2011 book about \nhis time as Iran\u2019s chief nuclear negotiator: \u201cWhile \nwe were talking to the Europeans in Tehran, we were \ninstalling equipment in Isfahan\u201d. For those here who \ndo not know, the Isfahan facility is an indispensable \npart of Iran\u2019s nuclear-weapons programme. That is \nwhere uranium ore called yellowcake is converted into \nan enrichable form. Rouhani boasted: \u201cBy creating a \ncalm environment, we were able to complete the work \nin Isfahan\u201d. He fooled the world once; now he thinks \nhe can fool it again. Rouhani thinks he can have his \nyellowcake and eat it too.\n\nHe has another reason to believe that he can get \naway with that, and that reason is called North Korea. \nLike Iran, North Korea also said its nuclear programme \nwas for peaceful purposes. Like Iran, North Korea also \noffered meaningless concessions and empty promises \n\n\n\f\nin return for sanctions relief. In 2005, North Korea \nagreed to a deal that was celebrated the world over by \nmany well-meaning people. Here is what a New York \nTimes editorial had to say about it:\n\n\u201cFor years now, foreign policy insiders have \npointed to North Korea as the ultimate nightmare ... a \nclosed, hostile and paranoid dictatorship with an \naggressive nuclear-weapons programme. Very few \ncould envision a successful outcome. And yet North \nKorea agreed in principle this week to dismantle its \nnuclear-weapons programme, return to the Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty, abide by the Treaty\u2019s \nsafeguards and admit international inspectors.\n\u201cDiplomacy, it seems, does work after all.\u201d \n(New York Times, 20 September 2005)\nA year later, North Korea exploded its first nuclear-\nweapon device.\nYet as dangerous as a nuclear-armed North Korea \nis, it pales in comparison to the danger of a nuclear-\narmed Iran. A nuclear-armed Iran would have a \nchokehold on the world\u2019s main energy supplies. It would \ntrigger nuclear proliferation throughout the Middle \nEast, turning the most unstable part of the planet into \na nuclear tinderbox. And for the first time in history, it \nwould make the spectre of nuclear terrorism a clear and \npresent danger.\n\nA nuclear-armed Iran in the Middle East would \nnot be another North Korea. It would be another \n50 North Koreas. I know that some in the international \ncommunity think that I am exaggerating that threat. \nSure, they know that Iran\u2019s regime leads these chants: \n\u201cDeath to America!\u201d, \u201cDeath to Israel!\u201d. Then it \npledges to wipe Israel off the map. But they think that \nwild rhetoric is just bluster for domestic consumption. \nHave those people learned nothing from history? The \nlast century has taught us that, when a radical regime \nwith global ambitions gets awesome power, sooner or \nlater its appetite for aggression knows no bounds. That \nis the central lesson of the twentieth century. And we \ncannot forget it.\n\nThe world may have forgotten that lesson; the \nJewish people have not. Iran\u2019s fanaticism is not bluster. \nIt is real. That fanatic regime must never be allowed to \narm itself with nuclear weapons. I know that the world \nis weary of war. We in Israel know all too well the cost \nof war. But history has taught us that to prevent war \ntomorrow, we must be firm today.\n\nThat raises the question: Can diplomacy stop \nthat threat? The only diplomatic solution that would \nwork is one that fully dismantles Iran\u2019s nuclear-\nweapons programme and prevents it from having one \nin the future. President Obama rightly said that Iran\u2019s \nconciliatory words must be matched by transparent, \nverifiable and meaningful action; and to be meaningful, \na diplomatic solution would require Iran to do four \nthings; first, cease all uranium enrichment, as called \nfor by several Security Council resolutions; secondly, \nremove from Iran\u2019s territory the stockpiles of enriched \nuranium; thirdly, dismantle the infrastructure for a \nnuclear-breakout capability, including the underground \nfacility near Qom and the advanced centrifuges in \nNatanz; and, fourthly, stop all work at the heavy water-\nreactor in Arak aimed at the production of plutonium. \nThose steps would put an end to Iran\u2019s nuclear-weapons \nprogramme and eliminate its breakout capability.\n\nThere are those who would readily agree to leave \nIran with a residual capability to enrich uranium. I \nadvise them to pay close attention to what Rouhani said \nin a speech to Iran\u2019s Supreme Cultural Revolutionary \nCouncil published in 2005. This is what he said:\n\n\u201cA country that can enrich uranium to about 3.5 per \ncent will also have the capability to enrich it to \nabout 90 per cent. Having fuel-cycle capability \nvirtually means that a country that possesses this \ncapability is able to produce nuclear weapons.\u201d\nPrecisely: that is why Iran\u2019s nuclear-weapons \nprogramme must be fully and verifiably dismantled. \nThat is why the pressure on Iran must continue. Here \nis what the international community must do. First, \nkeep up the sanctions. If Iran advances its nuclear-\nweapons programme during negotiations, strengthen \nthe sanctions. Secondly, do not agree to a partial deal. \nA partial deal would lift the international sanctions \nthat have taken years to put in place, in exchange for \ncosmetic concessions that will take only weeks for Iran \nto reverse. Thirdly, lift the sanctions only when Iran \nfully dismantles its nuclear-weapons programme.\n\nThe international community has Iran on the \nropes. If it wants to knock out Iran\u2019s nuclear-weapons \nprogramme peacefully, do not let up on the pressure. \nKeep it up. We all want to give diplomacy with Iran a \nchance to succeed. But when it comes to Iran, the greater \nthe pressure, the greater the chance. Three decades \nago, President Ronald Reagan famously advised \u201ctrust \nbut verify\u201d. When it comes to Iran\u2019s nuclear-weapons \n\n\n\f\nprogramme, here is my advice: distrust, dismantle and \nverify.\n\nIsrael will never acquiesce to nuclear arms in the \nhands of a rogue regime that repeatedly promises to \nwipe us off the map. Against such a threat, Israel will \nhave no choice but to defend itself. I want there to be \nno confusion on this point: Israel will not allow Iran to \nget nuclear weapons. If Israel is forced to stand alone, \nIsrael will stand alone. Yet in standing alone, Israel will \nknow that we will be defending many others.\n\nThe dangers of a nuclear-armed Iran and the \nemergence of other threats in our region have led many \nof our Arab neighbours to finally recognize that Israel \nis not their enemy. That affords us the opportunity \nto overcome historic animosities and build new \nrelationships, new friendships and new hopes. Israel \nwelcomes engagement with the wider Arab world. We \nhope that our common interests and common challenges \nwill help us forge a more peaceful future.\n\nAnd Israel continues to seek a historic compromise \nwith our Palestinian neighbours, one that ends our \nconflict once and for all. We want peace based on \nsecurity and mutual recognition in which a demilitarized \nPalestinian State recognizes the Jewish State of Israel.\n\nI remain committed to achieving a historic \nreconciliation and building a better future for Israelis \nand Palestinians alike. I have no illusions about how \ndifficult it will be to achieve. Twenty years ago, the \npeace process between Israel and the Palestinians began. \nSix Israeli Prime Ministers \u2014 myself included \u2014 have \nnot succeeded in achieving peace with the Palestinians. \nMy predecessors were prepared to make painful \nconcessions. So am I.\n\nBut so far, Palestinian leaders have not been \nprepared to offer the painful concessions they must \nmake in order to end the conflict. For peace to be \nachieved, the Palestinians must finally recognize \nthe Jewish State and Israel\u2019s security needs must be \nmet. I am prepared to make a historic compromise \nfor a genuine and enduring peace. But I will never \ncompromise on the security of my people and of my \ncountry \u2014 the one and only Jewish State.\n\nOne cold day in the late nineteenth century, my \ngrandfather, Nathan, and his younger brother, Judah, \nwere standing in a railway station in the heart of Europe. \nThey were seen by a group of anti-Semitic hoodlums, \nwho ran towards them waving clubs, screaming, \u201cDeath \nto the Jews!\u201d My grandfather shouted to his younger \nbrother to flee and save himself. And he then stood \nalone against the raging mob to slow it down. They beat \nhim senseless. They left him for dead. Before he passed \nout, covered in his own blood, he said to himself: \n\u201cWhat a disgrace! What a disgrace! The descendants \nof the Maccabees lie in the mud, powerless to defend \nthemselves.\u201d He promised himself then that if he lived, \nhe would take his family to the Jewish homeland and \nhelp to build a future for the Jewish people.\n\nI stand here today as Israel\u2019s Prime Minister because \nmy grandfather kept that promise. So many other Israelis \nhave a similar story: a parent or a grandparent who fled \nevery conceivable oppression and went to Israel to start \na new life in our ancient homeland. Together we have \ntransformed a bludgeoned Jewish people, left for dead, \ninto a vibrant, thriving nation, defending itself with the \ncourage of modern Maccabees, developing limitless \npossibilities for the future.\n\nIn our time, the Biblical prophecies are being \nrealized. As the prophet Amos said,\n\n\u201cThey shall rebuild ruined cities and inhabit \nthem. They shall plant vineyards and drink their \nwine. They shall till gardens and eat their fruit. \nAnd I will plant them upon their soil never to be \nuprooted again.\u201d\nThe people of Israel have come home, never to be \nuprooted again.\n"

I am \nconfident that the current session will be a fruitful one \nunder your able leadership.\n\nThe Republic of Korea is pleased that the United \nNations, in partnership with its Member States \nand under the stewardship of Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon, is strengthening multilateralism by \nsuccessfully responding to the diverse challenges that \nthe international community faces. We are confident \nthat the Secretary-General\u2019s Five-Year Action Plan \nwill help the United Nations to keep making important \ncontributions in this period of transformation.\n\nTwenty-two years ago I was present in the Assembly \nto watch with great emotion the historic moment when \nthe Republic of Korea was admitted as a State Member \nof the United Nations. The moment came at the end \nof a long wait during the Cold War. At that time the \nRepublic of Korea solemnly pledged to actively take \npart in the shaping of a new global order that is free, fair \nand prosperous and where justice and the rule of law \nprevail. To live up to this pledge, the Republic of Korea, \nthough a latecomer, has fully embraced the callings of \nthe United Nations with passion and devotion. In many \ncorners of the world, Korea has actively taken part in \npeacekeeping and reconstruction efforts. Currently, \nKorea is serving as a member of the Security Council \nand the Human Rights Council, among others.\n\nSince its inception, the United Nations has taken \non the noble endeavour of helping the peoples of the \nUnited Nations to live in larger freedom. However, \ninsecurity and inequality, injustice and intolerance still \nprevail in many parts of the world, where our common \nefforts are desperately needed. Furthermore, the rise \nof new global challenges, such as climate change, \nterrorism and cybercrime, calls for global cooperation \nthat transcends the existing inter-State system. In other \nwords, the importance and the relevance of the United \nNations is ever increasing, as it is a key vehicle for \nglobal cooperation.\n\nThe new Administration of the Republic of Korea \nhas put forward its foreign-policy vision, which is \nbuilt on two fundamental objectives: \u201chappiness of the \npeople\u201d and \u201chappiness of the global community\u201d. Such \n\n\n\f\na vision resonates with the core values of the United \nNations \u2014 peace, human rights and development.\n\nKorea seeks to make meaningful contributions to \nmaintain global peace beyond the Korean peninsula. \nWe want to share the fruits of our economic success, \nwhich was achieved with the help of the international \ncommunity, and strive to enhance the dignity and \nhappiness of all global citizens. I believe that that is \nin line with the purposes and principles of the United \nNations as well.\n\nThe first pillar in attaining global happiness is \nsecurity. In particular, the Republic of Korea is of \nthe view that the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and their means of delivery is one of the \nmost serious threats to international peace and security.\n\nIn that connection, the use of chemical weapons \nin Syria, as confirmed by the report of the United \nNations investigators (A/67/997), has caused the worst \nhumanitarian disaster in the twenty-first century. The \nGovernment of the Republic of Korea condemns the use \nof chemical weapons in the strongest possible terms, as \nit constitutes a crime against humanity that cannot be \ntolerated under any circumstances.\n\nIn that regard, we welcome the recent agreement \nbetween the United States and Russia on the Framework \nfor Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons, \nand expect a decision by the Organization for the \nProhibition of Chemical Weapons. and a reinforcing \nresolution by the Security Council, sometime today. We \nurge the Syrian Government to faithfully implement its \ncommitments to the international community. We also \nstrongly call upon all countries that have not acceded \nto the Chemical Weapons Convention, including the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, to do so as \nsoon as possible.\n\nIn that context, I must draw attention to the \nseriousness of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic\u2019s \nongoing weapons of mass destruction (WMD) \nprogrammes. Despite a series of Security Council \nresolutions, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic launched \nlong-range missiles and conducted nuclear tests as \nrecently as in early 2013, in blatant violation of its \ninternational obligations. It should strictly implement \nits obligations under the relevant Security Council \nresolutions, including resolution 2094 (2013). As is the \ncase with Syria, the international community should \nmake united efforts to roll back the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic\u2019s nuclear-weapons programmes to prevent \nthe advent of another nuclear-armed State. However, \nif it decides to give up its so-called parallel pursuit \nof economic development and nuclear armament and \nin turn embarks on a path of genuine change through \nconcrete actions, the Republic of Korea stands ready to \nhelp the Democratic People\u2019s Republic.\n\nAlongside the proliferation of WMD, terrorism \npresents a grave threat to international peace and \nsecurity in the twenty-first century. The Republic of \nKorea strongly condemns the terrorist attack that took \nplace last weekend in Nairobi, Kenya. Our sincere \ncondolences go out to the victims and their families of \nthe tragedy. The Government of the Republic of Korea \ndenounces all forms of terrorism and will continue to \ntake part in the global efforts to combat terrorism.\n\nTogether with its efforts to respond to the imminent \nsecurity threats, including the proliferation of WMD, \nthe new Administration of the Republic of Korea is \npursuing a policy that it calls \u201ctrustpolitik\u201d, to establish \na regional order of reconciliation and cooperation \nin the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia. Our \ntrustpolitik, in turn, is implemented through the Korean \nPeninsula Trust-Building Process and the Northeast \nAsia Peace and Cooperation Initiative.\n\nThe Korean Peninsula Trust-Building Process \naspires to safeguard peace based on strong deterrence, \nwhile simultaneously building peace through dialogue \nand cooperation. Through that process, the new \nAdministration of the Republic of Korea was able to \nensure the resumption of operations in the Kaesong \nindustrial park, the only remaining inter-Korean \neconomic cooperation project.\n\nFurthermore, the Republic of Korea proposes to \ncreate a world peace park in the world\u2019s most heavily \narmed demilitarized zone, in order to transform a \nlasting legacy of the Cold War and a divided Korea into \na new space of peace and harmony. It is my hope that the \nUnited Nations and the two Koreas will work together \nto bring this proposal to fruition, thereby contributing \ngreatly to the building of trust in the Korean peninsula.\n\nTurning to the broader region of North-East Asia, \nKorea is expecting further political and security \ncooperation that corresponds to the level of economic \ninterdependence in the region. To that end, the \nRepublic of Korea proposed the Northeast Asia Peace \nand Cooperation Initiative, which will open dialogue \non soft issues of common interests to the players in \nthe region. The Republic of Korea is also interested in \n\n\n\f\nlearning from the valuable experiences in successful \nregional institutions, such as the European Union, the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \nand the Regional Forum of the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations.\n\nThe second pillar of an era of global happiness \nis the promotion of human rights and human dignity \nas universal values. In the past century, the Republic \nof Korea went through a colonial occupation and a \ntragic internecine war. From that experience, Koreans \nbecame more appreciative than others of the paramount \nimportance of human rights and humanitarianism.\n\nWorldwide, there is an alarming increase in the \nnumber of refugees and internally displaced persons \nowing to wars and intra-State conflicts. Concerning \nthe massive refugee problem caused by the Syrian \ncivil war, my Government is actively involved in \ninternational efforts to assist the refugees. Korea is \nalso planning to co-host a working group meeting \non Syrian reconstruction in Seoul next month. The \nRepublic of Korea also wishes to emphasize the need to \nuphold the internationally established legal principle of \nnon-refoulement.\n\nToday, there are over 10 million people in Korea \nsuffering from the agony of not being able to see their \nloved ones across the inter-Korean border, even 60 years \nafter the end of the Korean War. Based on the recent \nagreement between the two Koreas, a reunion for those \nseparated families was to be held this week. However, \nto our utmost regret, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic \nof Korea unilaterally cancelled that reunion, which \nwould have been a humanitarian event, citing political \nreasons. Such an inhumane decision cannot be justified \nfor any sound reason. Thus far, the new Administration \nof the Republic of Korea has maintained the insulation \nof humanitarian issues from political considerations. \nI therefore urge the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea to convene the family reunion as soon as possible \nso as to ease the pain and suffering of the Korean people \nas a whole.\n\nThe Republic of Korea wishes to draw the attention \nof the Assembly to the increasing need to protect \ncivilians, including women and children, from armed \nconflicts around the globe. With that in mind, during \nits presidency of the Security Council in February, \nthe Republic of Korea chaired an open debate on the \nprotection of civilians in armed conflict (see S/PV.6917). \nWe are also one of the champions of the newly launched \nprotection from sexual violence initiative. In fact, \nsexual violence during conflicts is one of the most \nserious types of human rights violation. It is a war \ncrime that not only destroys the life of the victim, but \nalso that of the victim\u2019s family and the community.\n\nIn particular, for the victims of sexual violence \nduring conflicts of the past century, the pain and \nthe agony continue to this day. What matters most is \ngenuine remorse and concrete actions. As repeatedly \nemphasized in reports of United Nations special \nrapporteurs on sexual violence, responsible measures \nare called for that can restore the honour of the victims \nand soothe their pain, as such crimes involve a universal \nhuman rights issue.\n\nUnderdevelopment and extreme poverty are the \ncore challenges facing the United Nations today. Since \nthe Millennium Summit was held in 2000, the collective \nefforts by the international community to reach the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) have yielded \nsome very tangible results. However, progress has not \nbeen equally enjoyed across all regions, countries and \ngroups of people. It is against that backdrop that we \nattach great importance to discussions on the future \ndirection of and road map for development cooperation, \nunder the theme of \u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: \nsetting the stage\u201d, at the present session of the General \nAssembly.\n\nThe next set of common global development goals \nshould be genuinely people-centred and take into \naccount a standard of well-being that goes beyond the \ntraditional income levels. The new goals should place \nthe greatest priority on guaranteeing the dignity of all. \nFurthermore, they should seek to build partnerships \nwith the newly emerging development actors, so as to \neffectively utilize available capacities and resources. \nThe Republic of Korea hopes that the Busan Global \nPartnership for Effective Development Cooperation, \nlaunched in 2012, will also play a significant role in \nsetting up a new cooperative mechanism to lead the \nimplementation of the post-2015 development agenda.\n\nSuch development goals also coincide with Korea\u2019s \nforeign policy objective of building an era of global \nhappiness. The Republic of Korea hopes to work \ntogether to complete the unfinished business of the \nMDGs by pursuing a recipient-oriented development \ncooperation policy. More specifically, we will continue \nto increase our official development assistance and \nshare our successful development experiences, such as \nthe Saemaul Undong, or New Community Movement, \nwith developing countries.\n\n\n\f\nIn addition, a united response to climate change \nis critical to achieving global happiness. Korea will \nactively support the Green Climate Fund, headquartered \nin Korea, so that it develops into a significant \norganization that supports developing countries in \nresponding to climate change and the threats it brings.\n\nDeepening global interdependence has led to \nthe rise of challenges requiring a common response. \nExpectations of the role to be played by the United \nNations are now higher than ever before. Indeed, the \nUnited Nations has made great contributions as the \ncentre of global cooperation and is expected to continue \nin those noble endeavours. As former Secretary-General \nDag Hammarskj\u00f6ld once said, we should\n\n\u201crecognize the United Nations for what it is \u2014 an \nadmittedly imperfect but indispensable instrument \nof nations working for a peaceful evolution towards \na more just and secure world order\u201d.\nI am reminded of the solemn pledge that my \nGovernment made 22 years ago \u2014 that the Republic \nof Korea will actively contribute to the resolution of \nglobal challenges through the United Nations. Today, I \nstand before the Assembly to reaffirm the commitment \nof the new Government of the Republic of Korea \u2014 that \nKorea will contribute to realizing the era of global \nhappiness by achieving the goals set out by the United \nNations. It is only when we make common and collective \nefforts toward advancing the universal values of peace, \ndevelopment and human rights that the United Nations \nwill truly become the parliament of humankind.\n"

        "file_text": "I warmly \ncongratulate Mr. John Ashe on his election as President \nat the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly and \nwish him success during his term.\n\nOver the past decade, the world has experienced a \nstring of crises. Development has slowed. Confidence \nin the global economic system has been shaken. There \nare signs of recovery, but growth remains anaemic and \nuneven. Unemployment is high in many countries, \nparticularly among the young. That has exacerbated \nproblems by increasing poverty levels, widening \nincome gaps, adding to social instability and causing \npublic trust in Governments and institutions to decline. \nExtreme poverty remains a major concern in many \nparts of the world.\n\nViolence and conflict are as great a threat to global \nstability as poverty, and the international community \nmust respond firmly to them. In that regard, Singapore \nwelcomes the unanimous adoption of Security Council \nresolution 2118 (2013) on the destruction of chemical \nweapons in Syria. We strongly condemn the use of \nchemical weapons under any circumstances, as it \nconstitutes a violation of international law. We remain \ndeeply concerned about the humanitarian situation in \nSyria, and we hope that the \u201cGeneva II\u201d conference \nwill be convened promptly and will find a political \nsolution to end the conflict and violence. We also offer \ncondolences to the Government and the people of Kenya \nover the brutal attacks in Westgate Mall, a painful \nreminder of the need to remain vigilant against terror. \nAll countries must unite against violence and terror in \norder to create an environment in which sustainable \ndevelopment can be pursued.\n\nThe global ecosystem is under stress from \nthe transnational effects of human development \nactivities. Human progress has come at the expense \nof the environment and the climate. Deforestation, \ndesertification of land and the transboundary pollution \nof the sea, land and air degrade our quality of life and \nthreaten human civilization.\n\nWe cannot go on with business as usual. We need \nto rethink and retool our economies and societies and \nto place poverty eradication and sustainability at the \ncentre of our development agenda. The President\u2019s \nchoice of \u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: setting \nthe stage\u201d as the theme for the sixty-eighth session of \nthe General Assembly is therefore particularly timely. \nThe 1987 Brundtland report of the World Commission \non Environment and Development defined sustainable \ndevelopment as development that meets the needs of \nthe present without compromising the ability of future \ngenerations to meet their own needs. That should \nremain our guiding principle as we negotiate the post-\n2015 development agenda.\n\nThe United Nations has a critical role to play in the \nevolution of the post-2015 development agenda. Only \nthe United Nations, with its universal membership and \naccess to global data, has the standing to establish a \nnew global development agenda that is inclusive, \neffective and adaptable. The United Nations has \nadopted an inclusive multi-stakeholder approach to \ngather the views of Member States and harness the \nenergy of civil society. Several mechanisms have been \nset up, including the High-level Political Forum, the \nOpen Working Group on Sustainable Development \nGoals, in which Singapore is participating actively, \nand the Working Group on Sustainable Development \nFinancing. We strongly encourage the United Nations \nto demonstrate leadership and weave those strands of \ndiscussion into a single, clear framework. That would \nallow Member States to focus their attention and \nprioritize their resources to meet critical challenges.\n\nSingapore understands very well the importance \nof poverty eradication and sustainable development \nin securing a country\u2019s future. When we became \nindependent, in 1965, we faced several challenges. To \nuplift our population, which had only a small number \nof skilled workers and graduates, the Government \nfocused on education and skills development. To create \n\n\n\f\njobs and alleviate poverty, we also gradually moved our \nindustries up the value chain towards higher-skilled, \ninnovation-focused sectors. Given Singapore\u2019s land \nand resource constraints, sustainable development was \na necessity, not just a slogan. At 700 square kilometres, \nSingapore is slightly bigger than Manhattan but smaller \nthan the five boroughs of New York. To ensure that our \ncity-State remained liveable, we had to ensure that our \npolicies on housing, infrastructure, transport and the \nenvironment were well integrated in a long-term and \nholistic vision.\n\nOver several decades, we have managed to pursue \ngrowth while preserving a good living environment. For \ninstance, despite the country\u2019s being densely populated \nand highly urbanized, our greening efforts have resulted \nin more than 50 per cent of Singapore being covered by \nvegetation. The Singapore Botanic Gardens, founded in \nthe nineteenth century, is the only city botanic garden \nin the world to include a tract of original, primary \nrainforest. And despite our rapid development, we have \nmanaged to preserve much of our biodiversity. One of \nour nature reserves, Bukit Timah, contains more plant \nspecies than the entire North American continent.\n\nWe have also developed creative solutions to \novercome some of our resource constraints. Take the \nexample of water: Singapore now imports slightly more \nthan 40 per cent of our water needs. To meet our drinking \nand industrial needs, we use a variety of methods, \nincluding collecting water through reservoirs, the \ndesalination of seawater, and cutting-edge membrane \ntechnology to reclaim waste water into high-grade, \nultra-clean water, which we call \u201cNEWater\u201d. When \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon visited Singapore in \nMarch 2012, he was impressed enough by our water \nmanagement to make a toast with NEWater, rather \nthan wine, calling NEWater, \u201csomething far more \nvaluable \u2014 the elixir of life\u201d.\n\nLet me now turn to the post-2015 development \nagenda and suggest three priority areas. First, we should \nlearn from the example of the Millennium Development \nGoals. We should avoid being prescriptive. As each \ncountry is unique, countries should be allowed to \nexercise flexibility as to which goals they choose to \nprioritize and how they will achieve them. The new \nglobal development road map should have poverty \neradication and sustainable development at its centre \nand should converge around a single, clear set of \npractical and quantifiable goals. We should keep to \nthat outcomes-based approach and not forget that the \ncore purpose of the post-2015 development agenda is to \nimprove the lives of people. Today, 1.2 billion people \nstill live in extreme poverty. That is a staggering figure.\n\nSecondly, we should emphasize urban management \nand the intertwined issues of water and sanitation. \nAccording to the United Nations Human Settlements \nProgramme, more than half of the world\u2019s population \nlives in urban areas. By 2050, 7 out of 10 people will \nlive in urban areas. Many cities are already under \nstrain. More than 2.5 billion people lack access to basic \nsanitation, and another 800 million do not have safe \ndrinking water. Some 2,000 children die every day \nfrom diarrhoea. The crisis will be exacerbated as more \npeople move to crowded cities, where the infrastructure \ncannot grow fast enough to support them. Singapore \nintroduced a draft resolution in July, which was \nadopted by the General Assembly (resolution 67/291), \nto designate 19 November as World Toilet Day. We \nhope that will encourage countries to take a close look \nat how the nexus of urbanization, water and sanitation \ncan be better managed.\n\nThirdly, it is important for the views and concerns \nof small States to be incorporated into the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda. Small States make up more \nthan half of the United Nations membership; many, \nespecially small island developing States (SIDS), are \namong the more vulnerable Members of the United \nNations family. Singapore identifies closely with the \nurgent concerns of our fellow SIDS. The third SIDS \nConference, to be held in 2014, will be an important \nmilestone, and Singapore has participated actively \nin all the preparatory meetings to date. At last year\u2019s \ninaugural Conference on Small Island Developing \nStates, which was organized by the Forum of Small \nStates (FOSS), Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon agreed \nthat small and vulnerable States deserved special \nattention. Singapore will continue to work with the \nmembers of FOSS to share the perspectives of small \nStates and ensure that our views are factored into the \nevolution of the new global development road map.\n\nAlthough we are a small country, we will continue \nto play our part in assisting other countries in poverty \neradication and furthering the sustainable development \nagenda. We established the Singapore Cooperation \nProgramme in 1992 to share our developmental \nexperience with our friends \u2014 our successes and our \nfailures alike. We believe that technical assistance \nand capacity-building are more effective in creating \nthe right conditions for growth. More than 80,000 \n\n\n\f\nGovernment officials from 170 countries have received \ntraining under the Programme in areas as diverse as \nsustainable urban development, water management \nand human-resource development. To support our \nengagement in the post-2015 development agenda, \nwe will develop and customize new programmes on \nsustainable development and climate change that meet \nthe needs of SIDS and least developed countries.\n\nSingapore has also been working with other \nGovernments to promote sustainable development \ninternationally. In 2007, Singapore and China embarked \non a joint project to develop the Sino-Singapore \nTianjin Eco-city, which is envisioned as a city that \nwill be socially harmonious, environmentally friendly \nand resource-efficient. That will become a model \nfor sustainable urbanization in China. By 2020, \nthe Eco-city is intended to be a low-carbon, green-\nliving environment approximately half the size of \nManhattan, housing around 350,000 people. Singapore \nwill continue to share its experience in sustainable \nurbanization through Singapore-led events such as the \nbiennial Singapore International Water Week and the \nWorld Cities Summit.\n\nThe only way to secure our collective future \nis through poverty eradication and sustainable \ndevelopment. The next two years will be critical for the \nworld as we embark on an ambitious journey to map out \nthe post-2015 agenda. The United Nations must play a \nleading role, and we are fully committed to working \nclosely with other Member States to achieve that.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to begin by congratulating \nPresident Ashe on his election and wishing him great \nsuccess in presiding over the General Assembly. I \nwould also like to congratulate the outgoing President, \nMr. Vuk Jeremi., on his successful presidency. I also \nthank the Secretary-General for his leadership in \nstrengthening the United Nations ability to respond to \ntoday\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s challenges.\n\nEach year in September, world leaders gather in \nNew York to develop joint responses to challenges. That \nis a great challenge for all \u2014 national Governments, \ninternational and regional organizations, civil \nsociety and the private sector. We share the primary \nresponsibility for a peaceful and secure world that \nensures the rights and interests of individuals, nations \nand countries within the framework of the rule of \nnational and international law. That was also the \nobjective when the United Nations was established \nfollowing the Second World War.\n\nWe thank the President and the Secretary-General \nfor their engagement and leadership in the work to \nestablish the new post-2015 development framework, \nbuilding upon the Millennium Development Goals to \ninclude an economic, social and ecological dimension \nof sustainable development. What is important for \nthe post-2015 development agenda \u2014 an ambitious \nand complex project \u2014 is the building of a global \npartnership among Governments, the private sector, \ncivil society and individuals, including the mobilization \nof institutional and human resources. \n\nThe environment must be a key building block of \nsustainable development: it is nature that sustains us, \nand its resources should be used wisely. Economic \ngrowth facilitates human growth, reduces poverty and \nfacilitates better education and health care and is thus \na crucial element of any development framework. The \nRepublic of Macedonia will fully contribute to the \nachievement of all global objectives through its national \nagenda, in which investment in education, health, \nagriculture and food, the environment and infrastructure \nand the partnership between the Government and the \nbusiness community are the highest priorities.\n\nPeace, conflict resolution and human rights \nprotection are United Nations goals. Today they \nrepresent an even a greater challenge, which we should \nrespond to and overcome. The Republic of Macedonia \nsupports the approach of the United Nations in \nresponding to those challenges. We actively contribute \nto the promotion of peace on an international level, \n\n\n\f\nparticipating in international missions that safeguard \nfreedom and democracy.\n\nWith regard to one of the major issues \u2014 the crisis \nin Syria and the internal conflict that has created more \nthan 100,000 victims and 2 million refugees \u2014 what \nis more troubling is that chemical weapons were used \nagainst the Syrian people while diplomatic efforts \nwere under way, although their use is strictly prohibited \nunder international law. That must not be tolerated. We \nare among the countries to have asked for an urgent \ninvestigation under the auspices of the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s mechanism for the investigation of the alleged \nuse of chemical and biological weapons. \n\nDespite differing views, all member States of \nthe Security Council and of the United Nations agree \nthat to achieve a final resolution of the Syrian crisis, \nthe political approach should be given a chance. It \nis therefore essential to focus maximum effort on \nrevitalizing the search for a political settlement and to \nconvene the \u201cGeneva II\u201d conference as soon as possible. \nThe Syrian people deserve better days through decisive \naction by the international community that will end the \nviolence and threats.\n\nThe region of South-East Europe has entered a \nphase of positive development, and in general the \nnational and regional primary objectives are either \nfulfilled or are within reach. Regional cooperation \nis expanding in a number of new fields. Despite such \nadvances, certain long-standing unresolved or partly \nresolved bilateral issues are clearly having a negative \nimpact on our present and immediate future. In the \ncase of the Republic of Macedonia, that happens to be \na serious obstacle to our agenda for integration into \ninternational organizations.\n\nThe Republic of Macedonia is celebrating the \ntwentieth anniversary of its United Nations membership \nwith the still unresolved issues of the use of the name \nof my country, the Republic of Macedonia, and of the \nidentity of my people, the Macedonian identity. Those \nquestions emerged because of a dispute raised by our \nsouthern neighbour Greece, which opposes our name, \nwhich is our fundamental individual and collective \nright. The issue, which should have been promptly \nresolved among neighbours, partners and future allies, \nhas lasted for 22 years. While being a very realistic \nproblem for my people, this is an issue that I deeply \nbelieve is essentially hypothetical and does not have any \nbasis in international law or in the United Nations acts. \nIt is difficult, I would say even impossible, for someone \nto find a legal justification for such an objection.\n\nThe fact that the overwhelming majority of countries \nhave recognized our constitutional name \u2014 the Republic \nof Macedonia \u2014 with more than 135 of them being \nUnited Nations Members, clearly shows that most of \ncountries do not believe that the dispute has a justified \nbasis, or if it does they denounce it. I believe that this \nissue was a created one, a classic case of politicization \nand an instrument that, approximately 20 years ago, was \neither supposed to make someone score some political \npoints or, by creating an atmosphere of conflict, to \nbring about some strategic regional shifts, as well as to \nslow down the spread of freedom, democracy and the \nintroduction of market economies in the Balkans.\n\nAt the last session, the General Assembly discussed \nthe rule of law, with all Member States unanimously \nagreeing that respect for internationally agreed norms \nand principles was a must. Unfortunately, norms are not \nalways adhered to. The United Nations must be neither \nidle in that regard nor renege from its responsibility to \ncounter any disrespect for the rule of law.\n\nThe Republic of Macedonia became a United \nNations Member in 1993 with an atypical membership \ncondition, namely, the denial of its constitutional name. \nIt was admitted with an interim country reference \u2014 an \nunprecedented event in history that was contrary to the \nprovisions of international law. But we have endured all \nthat, although it lingers to date as a problem.\n\nIn 1995, under United Nations mediation, we \nsigned an interim accord with Greece by which we \nchanged our flag and parts of our Constitution, while \nGreece undertook not to create obstacles to our NATO \naccession in 2008. Not only did Greece obstruct our \nact of accession to the international Organization \nitself, it also obstructed the processes for opening the \nmembership procedures in another organization. For \nfour years in a row, Greece has prevented the start \nof negotiations for our membership in the European \nUnion. \n\nOn the basis of our appeal concerning the \nobstructions of Greece with regard to our application \nfor membership, in 2011 the International Court of \nJustice\\ \u2014 a principal organ of the United Nations \nestablished by States Members and located at The \nHague \u2014 issued a judgment that Greece had violated \ninternational law by not adhering to the interim accord \nand that the Republic of Macedonia had not violated \n\n\n\f\ninternational law or the commitments it had agreed to. \nHowever, we were hindered again, notwithstanding the \ndecision of the highest body of justice in the world, \nand that is apparent to the Assembly and its member \ncountries.\n\nThe United Nations was established in order to \nprotect international law. There is no regulation of \ninternational law that restricts a country from calling \nitself as it wishes, or restricts its citizens from being \nable to be called and named as they wish. Naming is \none of the five prerogatives of States, as well as an \nundisputed right of every Member country.\n\nWhy do we need international law if we do not \nadhere to it? If we turn a blind eye to that injustice \nand obvious violation of international law, we will be \ndirectly responsible for breaking one of the principles of \nworld peace and of the United Nations. We do not want \nthat, nor can we allow it. If it were not for international \nlaw, anarchy would reign and the United Nations would \nbecome a debate club without any basic competencies. \nWe do not want to participate in that, at the expense of \neverything, even to our own detriment.\n\nNot respecting international law also means having \nno respect for the 50 million victims that fought for it \n70 years ago, as well as going against the decisions of \nour predecessors \u2014 the founders of the Organization. \nInternational law should not be a platitude, but rather \nshould provide a solution to every challenge.\n\nAccording to international law, the Republic of \nMacedonia is entitled to decide on its own name and to \nuse the word Macedonian to denote its ethnic identity. \nSettling our differences with our southern neighbour is \nour priority, but only and precisely within the United \nNations resolutions that define the solution that is \nthe subject of discussion, and by reaching a mutually \nacceptable solution. We should settle our differences in \nno other way, especially not by expanding those limits.\n\nSixty-six years after the adoption of the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, this dispute, unjustly \nimposed on us by Greece, violates one of the \nfundamental rights of the individual \u2014 the right to \ndecide one\u2019s own name. Every representative of my \npeople is denied the right to be called as they wish, as \ntheir mothers and fathers, grandparents and all other \nancestors throughout history were called: Macedonian. \n\nIn addition to disputing the constitutional name of \nmy country \u2014 the Republic of Macedonia \u2014 Greece \nalso disputes the identity of my citizens, that is, it \ndoes not allow them to be called Macedonians or the \nlanguage that they speak to be called the Macedonian \nlanguage, despite the fact that for more than half a \ncentury there have been departments in universities \nthroughout the world where the Macedonian language \nhas been studied and it has been called the Macedonian \nlanguage. It is the same as if somebody denied an \nindividual the right to speak French, German, Polish, \nEnglish, Dutch, Portuguese, Japanese, Hindi or any \nother language. \n\nThe United Nations must not overlook the violation \nof the basic human right to decide one\u2019s own name, and \nshould take action to enable the exercise of that right. \nIn this particular case, the United Nations should take \naction that will lead to the settlement of the outstanding \nissues that Greece has with us.\n\nAt the previous session, we debated preventive \ndiplomacy and concluded that it should be an essential \nelement of the international community. Therefore, the \nUnited Nations must not, and should not, stand aside \nin this process, which severely hinders Macedonia\u2019s \naspirations to a better future for its citizens. \n\nCommitment is necessary to make it possible for \nGreece to begin resolving this issue, because in the past \ntwo years there has been great inertness on the part of \nGreece. Although that is a result of objective reasons \ncaused by its adverse economic situation, it also entails \na strategic and tactical political element based on the \nanalysis that prolonging the process of solving the \ndispute would contribute to the Republic of Macedonia \nbeing isolated in its positions, which are based on \ninternational law and values, and to its resignation to a \nkind of self-annihilation of the State and the nation by \nagreeing to be renamed. \n\nAccording to that line of thinking, with the lack \nof commitment in the discussions and the blocking \nof European and Euro-Atlantic integration that my \ncountry faces \u2014 integration that is directly hindered \nby the dispute despite our having met the standards \nrequired of us by the international multilateral \norganizations, NATO and the European Union \u2014 we \nwould thus be prevented from joining and face the \npossibility of internal misunderstandings regarding \nthe hindrance caused by our southern neighbour, and \nwe would drop our guard in spite of the force of the \narguments, which are on our side. It is true that by \nputting off the solution of the dispute, more challenges \nin the country and the region are created, and the tension \nbecomes greater at certain moments. But it should be \n\n\n\f\nclear to everyone that such challenges should not be \nconsidered a trigger for any changes of our justified \nand internationally correct position that would lead to a \nchange in our Macedonian identity. \n\nIt is not possible to change something that has \nexisted for centuries by imposing blockages or by threats \nabout possible misunderstandings, tensions or unrest, \nnot even by implementing them. The Macedonian \npeople will never accept being renamed. If it is not \npossible for that issue to be resolved now \u2014 although \nwe are the ones who are most interested in its resolution \nand we sincerely wish for a sustainable, balanced \nand, most important, mutually acceptable solution to \nbe found \u2014 then some other generation in different \ncircumstances will be able to resolve it, but precisely \non the basis of the values, positions and principles \nthat I mentioned before, which indicate a just and fair \nsolution, without winners and losers. \n\nHowever, I personally believe that we must not \nleave those thorny issues to future generations. We \nmust try to find a solution and find strength to provide \nprosperity for the countries and the region. It is said \nthat actions speak solely of those who undertake them. \nFaced with the lack of interest by the Hellenic Republic \nin substantive talks for a solution to the dispute, two \nmonths ago I suggested to the Greek Prime Minister a \nchange in the format of discussions, that is, raising them \nto a much higher political level. I as a Macedonian and \nhe as a Greek Prime Minister, together with ministers \nfrom both Governments, would meet directly and talk \nabout a solution. That would lead to greater efficiency, \nbecause we are the ones most often called upon to solve \nthe issue. Twenty-two years is too much time to not get \nanywhere and is sufficient proof that there must be a \nchange in the game. \n\nOur mandate, entrusted to us by the citizens, \nshould be essential to achieving a mutually acceptable \nsolution \u2014 which I believe can be attained \u2014 a \nsolution that will be accepted and agreed upon by the \ncitizens of our countries. The examples of Serbia and \nKosovo, as well as those of Croatia and Slovenia, where \npolitical representatives at the highest level managed \nto overcome challenges, are the best proof that results \ncan be achieved in that way. I invite the Assembly to \ndirectly take part in the realization of this initiative, \novercome the standstill and, through its commitment, \nprovide intensity and forward movement, as well as \ngreater interest on the part of Greece in a solution and \nprogress. \n\nActions speak of the one who undertakes them. \nWith our openness and with our justified initiative, we \nare showing that we wish for a solution to be found. \nHowever, our meetings must not be purely a formality; \nrather, they must have substance and must not create \nan alibi for not finding a solution. I am convinced that \nonly a substantial commitment by the international \ncommunity, above all by the United Nations, will lead to \na solution, taking into consideration the basic documents \nof the United Nations on the rights of countries and \nindividuals, the United Nations resolutions that defined \nthe talks, agreements guaranteed by the United Nations, \nthe decisions of United Nations bodies and international \nlaw as a whole.\n\nHowever, if there is no progress, the United \nNations must not remain inactive and be satisfied with \nthe status quo, as that would mean showing further \nirresponsibility. Aware of this already discouraging \nsituation, the United Nations should help via its \norgans, through the General Assembly and the Security \nCouncil. It is on the basis of Security Council resolution \n817 (1993) that we are in discussions with our neighbour \nto arrive at a solution that will free the identity of my \ncountry. Otherwise, the United Nations will be faced \nwith failure again and will bear the responsibility for \nnot having acted in accordance with its own principles \nand values. \n\nI do not want to spare anyone. We all have \nresponsibility, including the Organization. Instead \nof assuming that responsibility, the Organization \nhas accepted the comfort of remaining silent and not \nresolving the dispute; instead of defending itself, it has \nremained inactive with regard to the status quo, which \nis obviously creating problems and challenges for the \nregion. It should start considering alternative scenarios \nand doing more to stimulate a solution to this long-\nstanding dispute.\n\nI am confident that we have the capacity to jointly \nrespond to the challenges. In the name of the people \nthat we represent, we must assume responsibility for the \npresent and the future. Assuming such responsibility \nmeans taking decisions, changing habits and reinforcing \ncooperation and prosperity, but it is something that can \nbe done. That is the responsible way to proceed.\n"

        "file_text": "The Government of Honduras extends its warmest \ncongratulations to Mr. Ashe on his election to preside \nover the proceedings of the General Assembly, and we \nwish him every success.\n\nI am grateful for the honour that the President of \nHonduras conferred upon me by asking me to represent \nhim in this world forum. As we come to the close of our \nterm in office, we in the Administration of President \nPorfirio Lobo Sosa note with satisfaction that we have \nlaid the foundation for national unity and reconciliation. \nWe have successfully overcome the severe political \ncrisis that affected Honduras during the previous \nGovernment, and Honduras now looks forward to new \ngeneral elections in November.\n\nThe Government of President Lobo Sosa has \nnormalized relations with the international community. \nWe have secured ties of close cooperation with more than \na hundred friendly countries, restored foreign credit \nand shown the world that we are a country that lives up \nto its democratic and peaceful calling. Today, Honduras \nis a member of the principal international and regional \norganizations. Our membership in major forums has \ngiven us access to new markets, opportunities for \ninvestment and employment and helped to strengthen \nour energy sector.\n\nAs part of the process of unity and reconciliation, \nthe President of the Republic created a Government \nof National Integration, with the participation of all \nthe political parties that took part in the last electoral \nprocess. Fortunately, that participation continues \ntoday and will continue through the end of the present \nconstitutional term. Accordingly, I wish to mention that, \nas part of the process of healing the wounds of the 2009 \npolitical crisis and building the future together, we have \nsuccessfully adopted by consensus a long-term country \nvision and a national plan from which our Government \nprogramme is derived. That shared vision is being \nimplemented through a major national agreement \nfor economic growth with social equity between the \nGovernment of President Lobo Sosa, trade unions, \nbusiness owners, workers, farmers and civil society. I \nbelieve that Honduras and the world should welcome \nthose efforts, together with the spirit of dialogue and \ncommitment of all sectors of Honduran society, which \nhave shown that collective interests come well before \nindividual interests.\n\n\n\f\nToday, we are reaping the benefits of that major \nnational agreement. We have had successes in the small \nand medium-sized enterprise sector, social protection \nprogrammes, the establishment of a transparent budget \nand foreign trade. Democratic participation has also \nbeen strengthened because of the interaction of all \nsectors in our economic and social council, which is \na forum that has made it possible for mechanisms for \ndialogue and conflict prevention to work.\n\nWe are pleased to state that our Government will be \nhanding over to the incoming Administration a series of \nprinciples that should serve as a basis for consolidating \nsocial policies. Those principles were discussed \nand agreed upon between the Government and civil \nsociety in order to ensure a solid foundation and the \nsustainability of social institutions in the country.\n\nOur country and our democratic institutions have \nsuffered the onslaught of external aggression, which \nhas led to violence and insecurity. I am referring to \ndrug trafficking and various forms of transnational \norganized crime. With all the measures adopted to \ncombat crime, last year the Government of President \nLobo Sosa was able to halt the rise of the homicide \nrate, and this year we have seen a reduction in that \nrate. That has been achieved through the adoption by \nthe National Congress of an entirely new legal and \ninstitutional framework, which was lacking before. We \nhave undertaken a reform of the security and justice \nsystem. For the first time, we have adopted procedures \nto certify judicial officials, using confidence-testing \nmeasures. We have also adopted a tax to strengthen \ncitizen safety. To the extent possible, we are providing \ntraining for the security and defence institutions. We \nhave implemented a national policy to prevent violence \nagainst children and youth, and we have promoted and \nprotected human rights.\n\nAnd yet, while halting the spiral of violence is a \npositive sign, it is insufficient, given the high level of \ncriminal activity that had been reached. Our commitment \nto combat crime will be upheld until the very last day of \nour mandate. However, it is very important to sustain \nthose efforts. The new Government will have to do so \nwith a firm hand. It will have to continue to strengthen \nsecurity and justice institutions, which is a medium- to \nlong-term task. Combating global crime requires a more \ndecisive and more effective international and regional \neffort, in which drug-producing and drug-consuming \ncountries assume the shared and differentiated \nresponsibility that they bear in this wave of violence.\n\nToday, I reaffirm Honduras\u2019s commitment to the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, the right to \nlife and the respect for human dignity. We recognize \nthat the protection of human rights is the very essence \nof democracy. During our administration, we created \na Secretary of State for Justice and Human Rights \nand strengthened the role of the Special Prosecutor \nfor Human Rights. We established institutions for \ncombating torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading \ntreatment, and we enacted a law combating human \ntrafficking and introducing a public human rights \npolicy and a national plan of action for human rights. \nWe now require presidential candidates to sign the \nhuman rights pact.\n\nIt is fundamentally important to Honduras that \nwe continue working towards meeting the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, with which we have made \nsignificant progress. Food and nutrition security is a \nnational priority for President Porfirio Lobo Sosa\u2019s \nGovernment, and we have focused efforts to eradicate \nhunger through various food and nutrition security \nprogrammes targeting the most vulnerable people and \nthe neediest areas of the country.\n\nThrough its recognition of the multidimensional \nand multisectoral nature of the food and nutrition \nsecurity issue, the Government of our Republic reduced \nthe population suffering from malnutrition by 21 per \ncent between 2010 and 2012, meeting and exceeding its \ntarget for the Millennium Development Goals. As an \nexample of our multisectoral approach and to ensure \nthe sustainability of our programmes, I am pleased to \nannounce the launch of a Government initiative, the \nPartnership for the Dry Corridor. The Partnership, \nwhich has the support of the international community, \ntargets those suffering from poverty and hunger in our \ncountry\u2019s most vulnerable area.\n\nConcerning education, I should emphasize that \nHonduras has seen a significant increase in the number \nof 5-year-olds entering the pre-school system. It is \nroughly triple what we expected. Our Government \nhas been deeply committed to reforming the national \neducation system. The new legal framework requires \na broad participatory process involving parents, \ncommunities and teachers. The proposal that President \nLobo made here in the General Assembly last year, \nwhen he said that classrooms must never be closed (see \nA/67/PV.6, p. 49), has led to a considerable increase in \nthe number of school days for children in Honduras. \nThat has resulted in an improvement in the quality of \n\n\n\f\neducation, and as a nation we are very optimistic about \nit.\n\nAs to gender equality and the empowerment of \nwomen, we have made progress in implementing \na gender equality system, created with a view to \npromoting, encouraging and institutionalizing gender-\nequity policies and improving equality of opportunity \nbetween men and women. With regard to the reduction \nof under-five mortality and improving maternal health, \nour Government approved a public policy for the holistic \ndevelopment of infants and a comprehensive care \nstrategy for children in the community. The strategy \nhas been internationally recognized, because it has \nimproved maternal health conditions before, during and \nafter delivery and has thus lowered the mortality risk \nand increased the number of births in medical centres.\n\nSimilarly, it is important to emphasize the efforts \nwe have made to reduce infant morbidity and mortality \nassociated with diseases that are preventable through \nvaccination; our broad immunization programme has \nachieved more than 90 per cent coverage for vaccines \nrequired for children under the age of 2. With regard \nrespect to HIV/AIDS, our Government has increased \nthe national budget for prevention and care and has \nfinanced almost 100 per cent of the antiretroviral \ntreatment.\n\nConcerning the delimitation of maritime space \nin the Pacific Ocean, and specifically the situation \nin the Gulf of Fonseca, a historic bay that Honduras \nshares in a co-sovereignty regime with El Salvador \nand Nicaragua, my Government wishes to reiterate its \nrespect for the decision that the International Court of \nJustice handed down on 11 September 1992. We also \naffirm our commitment to including a comprehensive \ncooperation agreement under the auspices of a \ntri-national commission of coastal States, which \ndevelops conservation and protection programmes for \nthe environment in the Gulf and the improvement of \nliving conditions for neighbouring communities. It is \nan opportune moment to recall that it was in October \n2012 that Honduras first asked the Security Council \nto authorize the Secretary-General to provide all \nnecessary support for constituting that authority, and I \ntake this opportunity to repeat our request. I thank the \nEuropean Union for its cooperation in developing this \nzone, which has great economic potential.\n\nI would like to emphasize the importance that all \ncoastal States attach to the decisions of the International \nCourt of Justice. We wish to avoid making any territorial \nor maritime claims that would distance us further from \nthe big picture, which is to make the Pacific Ocean and \nthe Gulf of Fonseca a zone of cooperation and peace. \nBut given the understanding and neighbourliness \nwe possess, we have concluded, based on equitable \nprinciples, the necessary agreements regarding the \nmaritime impact on the Pacific Ocean. Honduras has \nalready made proposals that we are prepared to discuss \nwith our fraternal neighbours.\n\nI wish to underscore the fact that our Government \nhas defined a strategy for a governmental transition \nfor 2013-2014, whose primary objective is to ensure \nan orderly and structured handover, so as to avoid the \nvacuums and delays in planning that have traditionally \naccompanied a change of Government. It is essential \nto ensure the sustainability of public policies beyond \nthe life of our Administration, so that we can achieve \nlong-term planning that benefits the Honduran people. \nIn November we will hold general elections with the \nparticipation of nine political parties, including a strong \nfemale presence in the election process. Honduras\u2019s \nelectoral authorities, which function independently, are \nmaking every possible effort to ensure that the general \nelections are free and transparent. On behalf of the \npeople of Honduras, I would like to ask all friendly \nnations to support our electoral process. All States are \nwelcome to witness it.\n\nI hope sincerely that, during its sixty-eighth session, \nthe General Assembly will meet the expectations of \nMember States, and I take this opportunity to express \nmy thanks, on behalf of the people and Government \nof Honduras, for the solidarity that the international \ncommunity has shown to the Administration of \nPresident Porfirio Lobo Sosa.\n"

        "file_text": "Like the \nHeads of State and Government who have spoken \nbefore me, I would like, on behalf of the delegation of \nC\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire and on my own behalf, to address my \nsincere congratulations to Mr. Ashe on his outstanding \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-eighth session. I also wish in particular to thank \nSecretary-General Ban ki-Moon for his leadership of \nthe Organization and his commitment to world peace \nand development. I take this opportunity to reiterate to \nhim, in the name of my counterparts in the Economic \nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), our \ngratitude for his personal involvement in the resolution \nof conflicts in Africa and especially in the subregion of \nWest Africa.\n\nBefore touching on the topic of today\u2019s debate, in \ntaking the floor for the second time before the Assembly \nI would like to reaffirm the gratitude of the Ivorian \npeople for the efforts of the United Nations and the \ninternational community on our behalf. Indeed, thanks \nto that invaluable support, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is now hard \nat work and has returned to the path of economic and \nsocial development for the well-being of all Ivorians. \nMy country is in a period of full reconstruction after \nestablishing credible and democratic institutions \nfollowing free, transparent elections. National \nreconciliation and political dialogue are under way in \na climate of peace. We are aware of the challenges that \nremain, but we are on the right path.\n\nThe theme for this session, \u201cThe post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage\u201d, calls on us all \nindividually and collectively to consider our capacity \nto meet the development challenge. As we approach \nthe 2015 target date for achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, it should be noted that significant \nprogress has been achieved by most countries, and \nwe welcome the determination of all Governments \nto continue their efforts to meet the Millennium \ncommitments. \n\nAlthough much remains to be done and the \nprogress made can mask various national and regional \nrealities, the current trend appears to be irreversible, \ndespite a particularly difficult economic environment. \nWe must seek to build on the positive outcomes that \nhave been achieved in a number of areas, such as \nprimary school enrolment, vaccinations and slowing \nthe spread of HIV/AIDS. We must also resolve issues \nof food security, drought, access to drinking water \nand combating poverty, which continue to be major \nconcerns for our States.\n\nBy adopting the Millennium Development Goals, \nwe have the collective responsibility and ambition to \nimprove the living conditions of our fellow citizens and \nthereby accelerate the development of our countries. As \nfar as my country, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, is concerned, progress \ntowards meeting the Millennium Development Goals, \nwhich was deadlocked because of the sociopolitical \ncrisis, has today gained new momentum, thanks \nto the sound performance of our economy. It is in \nthat favourable climate that the Government has \nestablished an ambitious reconstruction programme, \nwhich is based on the national development plan for \nthe period 2012-2015. Social investments being a \npriority in that programme, the programme allocates \nsubstantial amounts to education, health and basic \nsocial infrastructure. The Government has also made \njob creation a national priority, in particular jobs for \nyoung people, and its goal is to create 200,000 jobs a \nyear, which is a considerable number given the size of \nour country. \n\nAs we assess what has been accomplished, we must \nface the fact that the world needs greater solidarity to \nreach the Millennium Development Goals. Therefore, \nwe must adopt a comprehensive approach that will \nenable our countries to create sustainable development \nmodels that are more equitable and more respectful \nof our differences. The African continent, which lags \nbehind in the effort to achieve the Goals by 2015, \ncan nevertheless count on an increasing share in the \nglobal economy because of its growth rate. My country \ntherefore supports the definition of a post-2015 agenda \nto forge a new consensus regarding a new generation \nof sustainable development goals, based on the \nMillennium Development Goals.\n\nThe world we seek will not come about unless \nwe meet the challenge of peace and security, as well \nas that of democracy, through a return to the values \nof the Charter of the United Nations. Too many wars \n\n\n\f\nand conflicts continue to tear humankind apart, \nundermining development efforts in numerous \ncountries. We must collectively put an end to that \nsituation by ensuring that we serve the interests of the \npeople exclusively, using the tools we already have. It \nis by renewing the foundations of our solidarity that we \nwill be able to counter new threats, such as terrorism, \ncross-border crime, drug and arms trafficking, human \ntrafficking and piracy at sea.\n\nThe attack of a rare violence that occurred in our \nbrother country, Kenya, is an example of those threats, \nand reminds us of the urgent need for collective action \nagainst the threat of terrorism. We condemn in the \nstrongest possible terms that despicable and barbarous \nact, which shows that the fight against terrorism is \nongoing and calls for new methods of security. In these \ntimes of great suffering, I would like, on behalf of my \ncountry and West Africa, to convey to the brotherly \npeople of Kenya and its President our compassion and \nsupport.\n\nInternational governance must become more \ndemocratic and increasingly embody the universal \nconsensus and the values of our nations. Indeed, the \nworld must be able to recognize itself in its multilateral \ninstitutions in order to effectively deal with the hazards \nof this new century.\n\nWest Africa is aware of the threat posed to \nits development, the deterioration in the security \nenvironment and the proliferation of new factors of \ninstability. Accordingly, the Heads of State of ECOWAS \nare rightly doing everything possible, with the support \nof the international community, in a determined effort \nto re-establish and maintain peace in our region. For \nthat reason, we welcomed with the utmost satisfaction \nthe re-establishment of the territorial integrity of Mali \nand the successful holding of presidential elections in \nthat country. \n\nThat success must not hide the major challenges \nstill facing our region. I therefore call upon the \ninternational community to learn from the conflict in \nMali and to support ECOWAS and the African Union in \nimplementing a coherent and proactive security policy. \nTerrorism in the Sahel region is spreading to such an \nextent that entire expanses are outside the authority of \nStates. The threat goes beyond the borders of the African \ncontinent and demands a concerted international \nresponse in keeping with the stakes involved. \n\nI would like to encourage donors and our traditional \npartners to provide their support to the United Nations \nand to our States within the framework of this strategy. \nWe welcome the announcement of the upcoming visit \nof the Secretary-General and the President of the World \nBank to the Sahel region in order to mobilize the entire \ninternational community and the financial institutions. \n\nIf we want to end the cycle of politico-military \ncrises in West Africa, Guinea-Bissau must also receive \ninternational support, so that we can build upon the \ncurrent inclusive transition and enable the Government \nto organize democratic elections next November. For \nthat reason, on behalf of ECOWAS, I call upon the \ninternational community to contribute to the financing \nof general elections in that country.\n\n\nIn closing, I would like to remind our Assembly that \nin order to meet the challenges of international peace \nand security, we must redouble our efforts to deliver on \nthe commitments made at United Nations conferences \nand summits. The right to development must become a \nreality for all, as set out in the Millennium Declaration \n(resolution 55/2), which was unanimously adopted in \nSeptember 2000. We must all draw lessons from the \nshortcomings of the past in order to rebuild the world \ngloriously for ourselves, our children and our children\u2019s \nchildren.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to begin by \nextending my heartfelt congratulations to the President \nof the General Assembly on his assumption of office \nat the sixty-eighth session. I also wish to commend \nthe Secretary-General on his leadership during what \nis a trying and testing time around the globe. We are \nconfident in his leadership and in the Organization\u2019s \nresolve in tackling the many unprecedented challenges \nof our time.\n\nChallenges, old and new, seem to be a recurring \ntheme during this general debate, and it is only right \nthat it be so: it is when we face enormous challenges and \nwhen we feel most uncomfortable, vulnerable, unhappy \nand unfulfilled that we are most likely to think above \nand beyond and seek new answers to old questions.\n\nThe most pressing challenge for the United Nations \nis definitely that of remaining relevant, given the \nrealities of the twenty-first century, as the Organization \nremains the ultimate guarantor of the sovereign equality \nof nations and the only international institution to which \nall countries, big and small, can look to ensure justice, \nfreedom and peace. The Maldives, along with other \nStates, has been calling for the reform of the Security \nCouncil to make it more inclusive, and thereby more \ncredible and reflective of the voices of not only the \npowerful but also the weak, and more representative of \nthe global population and its geographic distribution. \nIn addition to the Council\u2019s composition, its working \nmethods must also be improved \u2014 only then can the \nUnited Nations restore its credibility, authority and \nlegitimacy.\n\nGlobal challenges are of significant importance \nto the Maldives. The situation in the Middle East is \nparticularly close to the hearts of Maldivians. We are \nappalled at the human cost of the conflict in Syria. The \nuse of chemical weapons at any time, by anyone, and for \nwhatever purpose must not be tolerated. In that regard, \nthe Maldives welcomes Security Council resolution 2118 \n(2013), on the destruction of the chemical weapons in \nSyria, which was adopted unanimously. The Council\u2019s \ndecision will, we hope, take us a step closer to ending \nthe atrocities taking place there as we speak. Violence \nbegets violence. We therefore call on both sides of the \nconflict to choose the path of dialogue, not of violence.\n\nThe Maldives also calls on the General Assembly \nto recognize the legitimate aspirations of the \nPalestinian people. We urge the Assembly to support \na two-State solution through the establishment of the \nState of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, \non the lands occupied in the 1967 war. Is it fair that \nPalestinian children grow up without a country of their \n\n\nown? Is it fair that the Palestinian needs for security, \nstability, prosperity and development go unanswered \nand unfulfilled because of the continued violence? We \nhave discussed that issue enough. It is time for action. \nWe are encouraged by the renewed United States-led \nIsraeli-Palestinian peace talks. It is our earnest hope \nthat those talks will ultimately lead to a peaceful and \nsecure future for future generations of Palestine and \nIsrael.\n\nWith the deadline for the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) fast approaching, the focus of the world \nand the Assembly has turned to the post-2015 agenda. \nHowever, accelerating the achievement of the original \nMillennium Development Goals remains an urgent \nnecessity. The Maldives therefore calls on all nations \nto fulfil their official development assistance (ODA) \ncommitments and thereby help the most vulnerable \npopulations overcome the challenges they face in \nachieving the MDGs.\n\nWe in the Maldives have made remarkable progress \non the MDGs, having achieved five out of the eight \nahead of the deadline. Although we have not achieved \nthree of the MDGs, we are proud of the work we \nhave done towards achieving them, in particular on \nthe advancement of women. Our country has shown \npromise in addressing gender equality, especially in \nthe area of health and education. It has nearly achieved \nuniversal access to basic health care for women and is \nproud of high literacy rates among boys and girls alike. \nThe Maldives regards improving the socioeconomic \nrights of women as an integral part of national \ndevelopment and a core component of sustainable \ndevelopment. Unfortunately, we are facing setbacks on \nsome of the MDGs that have been achieved, and are \neven regressing, owing to emerging issues, especially \nthe loss of ODA as we graduate from the status of a least \ndeveloped country (LDC), while persistent challenges \nhinder the achievement of the whole set of MDGs. \nTherefore, achieving and sustaining the progress on the \nMDGs will remain the key development challenge for \nthe future.\n\nIn formulating the post-2015 developmental \nagenda, we should be mindful of the fact that MDGs \nare multidimensional and interconnected. They are not \nan end in themselves or a final solution, but merely a \nbeginning.\n\nThe Maldives is encouraged by the multi-stakeholder \nmechanisms that are ongoing within the United \nNations. It is our hope that all of those mechanisms will \nbe considered holistically and not in isolation, as we \nmove towards a more concrete post-2015 development \nagenda.\n\nIt is also our sincere hope that the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals will not be left non-fulfilled and \nthat the post-2015 development agenda and sustainable \ndevelopment goals (SDGs) are not seen in isolation from \nthe MDGs. We hope that the sustainable development \ngoals will be seen as a continuation of the MDGs. The \nformulation of the SDGs and the post-2015 development \nagenda should complement the achievement of the \nMDGs and reflect any gaps therein. We also hope \nthat no nation will be left without an avenue towards \nprogression and that no small island developing State \n(SIDS) is left behind.\n\nAs we talk about the development agenda that \nwe set for ourselves at the turn of this millennium, I \ncannot help but wonder whether the Maldives and other \nlow-lying island States will survive to see another \ncentury, let alone another millennium. The Maldives \nis a small nation with meagre resources that faces \nnumerous challenges when it comes to food, water \nand energy security \u2014 a nation that has, despite our \nsmall size, advocated loud and clear for international \nactions to address climate change. We have sought to \nhelp the world to see that the right to a safe and secure \nenvironment is a basic human right.\n\nI urge all United Nations institutions to solidify \nand strengthen all standards and move towards the \ncreation of an international mechanism. We need to \nstrengthen institutions and cultivate a more dependable \nand consistent approach towards climate change and \nthe consequent human rights issues that will become \nthe most pressing challenges facing humanity.\n\nFor example, the report of the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change presented to world leaders \njust last week underscored the need for urgent action on \nthe issue of climate change. The report concludes that, \nin the event of a business-as-usual scenario, low-lying \nnations will face grave existential threats.\n\nWhat does that mean for the Maldives? With 80 per \ncent of our small nation barely 1.5 metres above sea level \nand with more than 45 per cent of settlements within \n100 metres of the coastline, all facets of our lifestyle, \nculture and economy depend almost exclusively \non coastal and marine biodiversity. At present, our \nbiodiversity contributes to 70 per cent of our national \n\n\n\f\nemployment, 49 per cent of public revenue, 62 per cent \nof foreign exchange, 98 per cent of exports and 89 per \ncent of our gross domestic product. Any loss of that \nbiodiversity will result in catastrophic consequences \nfor the Maldives.\n\nThose are facts, but we have known those facts for \na long time. What we need now is action. Our inaction \nspeaks louder than words.\n\nAs a nation, Maldives has witnessed the trials of \ngraduation from LDC status without due consideration \nfor the inherent vulnerabilities of small island nations. \nSimply having a high gross national income or a high \nstanding in the human development index does not \nmake SIDS less vulnerable to external shocks, including \nemerging threats such as climate change; nor does it \nremove the difficulties associated with their smallness \nand remoteness, and in achieving economies of scale.\n\nThe Maldives is a perfect example of a SIDS \ngraduating from LDC status based on distorted data \nand geographically disassociated global aggregates and \nindices. Even upon graduation, our country continues \nto face numerous economic, social and climate-change \nchallenges. That must be a lesson to learn from as we \ndevelop the post-2015 development agenda.\n\nSIDS require differential treatment because of \ntheir unique inherent vulnerabilities. That is why the \nMaldives and other countries in the same plight have \nbeen advocating relentlessly to find a comprehensive \ndefinition for SIDS. SIDS need to be given full \nrecognition within the global governance regimes \nand multilateral and financial institutions, and \nadequately integrated and institutionalized within the \nUnited Nations system. Doing so would help to target \nassistance more effectively. That is also why we support \nthe inclusion of a SIDS-focused goal in the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda.\n\nAll of the challenges I have outlined are key to \nthe Maldives. However, the most pressing challenge \nto the Maldives remains democracy consolidation \nand concerted efforts by external forces to prevent \nthe emergence of an indigenous democratic system of \ngovernance in the Maldives.\n\nA few weeks ago, the Maldives held its second \nmultiparty elections. It was one of the most competitive \nelections in the country\u2019s history, yet it did not produce \na clear winner. Some of the parties that competed in the \nelection have identified serious issues with the conduct \nof the elections and have asked the Supreme Court of \nthe Maldives for a ruling. We are expecting the Court \nto hand down a ruling in the coming days. The integrity \nof the second round of our presidential election cannot \nbe maintained without ensuring the integrity of the \nfirst round through constitutional means. We await \nthe Supreme Court\u2019s verdict to continue the electoral \nprocess, allowing for a new President to be sworn in on \nNovember 11.\n\nHowever, some external forces are attempting to \nshape the outcome of what in effect is an internal issue. \nThe Maldives is small. Our democracy is in its infancy. \nOur institutions are young. That does not, however, \nmean that larger countries have a right to intervene and \nattempt to dictate outcomes in the domestic affairs of \nthe Maldives.\n\nNon-interference in the internal affairs of \nsovereign States is a core principle of the Charter of \nthe Organization. Yet small States have frequently \nbeen the victims of the predatory designs of larger \ncountries. It is for that reason that the Maldives \ninitiated resolution 44/51, on \u201cProtection and security \nof small States\u201d, in the Assembly in 1989. The call for \nprotecting small States from external threats is further \nreiterated in resolutions 46/43 and 49/31, recognizing \nthe particular vulnerabilities of small States to external \nthreats and acts of interference in their internal affairs. \nThe resolutions also call on all nations to respect \nthe principle of territorial integrity and national \nsovereignty. Therefore, my delegation trusts the United \nNations to be the ultimate guarantor of the security of \nsmall States such as the Maldives.\n\nDemocracy consolidation is not just about holding \nelections. Nor is it about having a democratically sound \nConstitution. In the Maldives, too, we quickly found \nthat changing the Constitution, or having a multiparty \nelection, did not instil democratic values within our \nsociety.\n\nFor democracy to be cultivated and consolidated, \nthe supremacy of the Constitution must be upheld \nabove all. The institutional deficiencies we face must \nbe addressed within constitutional provisions, and \nthe political leadership must sustain an unshakeable \ncommitment to the principles and values of democracy. \nThe rule of law must prevail.\n\nOur institutions are young. Therefore, \ninstitution-building and reform remain a key challenge \nfor the Maldives. More importantly, cultivating a \nculture of respect for human rights, tolerance, pluralism \n\n\n\f\nand freedom remains incredibly important as we move \nthrough the democratic journey.\n\nThose are the reasons why the Maldives decided \nto present its bid for re-election to the Human Rights \nCouncil. Our membership in the Council over the \npast three years has helped the country to take some \nunprecedented and bold measures to bring the country\u2019s \nnational human rights mechanisms up to international \nstandards. The Maldives believes that its continued \nmembership would help it to further accelerate ongoing \nefforts in modernizing institutions and in promoting a \nculture of respect for human rights and democracy in \nMaldivian society.\n\nWithout democracy, the rule of law, human rights \nand peace we would have nothing, we would achieve \nnothing, and we would sustain nothing. In order to \ntackle the many challenges confronting the Maldives, \nwe must adopt an inclusive form of governance where \nthe voices and opinions of even the most vulnerable \nand the most disadvantaged in our society are heard. \nWithout equality and justice, societies cannot prosper \nat all.\n\nDemocracy consolidation is a long and arduous \njourney, but it is one worth making. Our pace may \nnot be as fast as the international community desires. \nBut the Maldives is in the process of solidifying \nthe foundations of our society for development, for \ndemocracy and for the protection of human rights. But \nthat does not mean that we do not need the international \ncommunity\u2019s assistance.\n\nWe know better than most that to be an emerging \ndemocracy is to be constantly challenged by volatile, \nnew and emerging issues. There is no leeway to stumble, \nno room to hesitate, and we will not falter in our resolve. \nWe will strengthen and redefine our institutions. We \nwill adhere to our Constitution. We will work with our \ninternational partners, and we will move forward as a \nnation and as a sustainable society.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like \nto congratulate Mr. John Ashe on his election as the \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth \nsession. My delegation has full confidence that under \nhis able leadership the new session will draw to a \nsuccessful conclusion. The President can rest assured \nof Cambodia\u2019s full support and cooperation throughout \nhis presidency.\n\nThis year session\u2019s theme, \u201cThe post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage,\u201d is very \ntimely as we have less than 1,000 days to reach the \nMillennium Development Goal (MDG) targets. That \ndevelopment agenda will be one of the most ambitious \nprojects undertaken by the United Nations, in which all \nnations will be called upon to galvanize efforts to help \nthe world live up to its commitments to end poverty, \neducate children, empower women and provide health \nservices for all.\n\nWhile the overall picture is encouraging, we \nmust also recognize that the progress made towards \nattaining the MDGs has been insufficient and uneven. \nPoverty is still widespread, with more than one billion \npeople living in extreme poverty. High maternal and \nchild mortality rates are still seen in too many places \nthroughout the developing world. Most developing \ncountries still face many obstacles to the achievement \nof all the MDGs within the allocated time frame \nof 2015, owing to their vulnerability to the global \nfinancial crisis, their debt burdens and the failure of \nsome developed countries to meet official development \nassistance (ODA) commitments.\n\nIt is high time for donor countries to fulfil their \nODA pledges. In addition, debt relief is one of several \nfinancial-assistance instruments which can enhance \nthe developing countries\u2019 ability to eradicate poverty. \nFurthermore, facilitating the transfer of technology \nfrom the developed to the developing world plays \na critical role in helping countries to further their \ndevelopment efforts and accelerate their economic \ngrowth.\n\nIn the case of Cambodia, the MDGs are firmly \nembedded as the cornerstone of the country\u2019s \ndevelopment policies and strategies. In a country \nwhose entire population once faced abject poverty \nand hunger after emerging from war and genocide in \n1979, the number of people living below the national \npoverty line dropped steadily, reaching 19.8 per cent \nin 2011. The country is well on track \u2014 if not ahead of \nschedule \u2014 in terms of attaining its poverty-reduction \ngoal of 19.5 per cent. In fact, Cambodia received a \nUnited Nations award for reducing hunger by half well \nahead of the MDG target. In general, my country is well \npositioned to meet most of the Goals on schedule by the \nend of 2015, thanks not only to the Government\u2019s sound \napproach and firm commitment but also to sustained \npeace and political stability.\n\nIn adopting the MDGs, we acknowledged that \nsustained and inclusive economic growth in developing \ncountries was a key requirement for eradicating \npoverty and meeting the targets. In that context, my \ndelegation highly appreciates the far-sighted report of \nthe High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-\n2015 Development Agenda, which is entitled A New \n\n\n\f\nGlobal Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform \nEconomies through Sustainable Development, and \nwhich sets forth a universal agenda to eradicate extreme \npoverty from our world by 2030 and to deliver on the \npromise of sustainable development.\n\nCambodia believes that the post-2015 development \nagenda should carry forward the spirit of the \nMillennium Declaration in various ways: first, by \nsetting out a balanced integration of the economic, \nsocial and environmental dimensions for sustainable \ndevelopment; secondly, by aiming at the completion \nof the work started under the MDGs, particularly \nthe goal of eradicating extreme poverty; thirdly, by \nemphasizing inclusive, equitable and sustainable \ndevelopment and economic growth aimed at effectively \naddressing inequality and any associated factors; and, \nfourthly, by focusing not only on the global dimension \nof development, but also on its regional dimension, \nwhile taking into account the particular challenges of \nthe least developed countries.\n\nWith regard to the nineteenth session of the \nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held \nin Warsaw in November, my country has high hopes \nthat the Conference will ratify the second commitment \nperiod of the Kyoto Protocol by 2015. Cambodia \ngreatly appreciates the developed countries\u2019 continued \ncommitment to providing funds and technology to help \ndeveloping nations tackle climate change, in accordance \nwith the United Nations principle of common but \ndifferentiated responsibilities.\n\nGlobal and regional peace and security are currently \nthreatened by conflicts, armed confrontation and \ntransnational organized crime, which take a heavy toll \non many development efforts. Against that backdrop, \nCambodia welcomes the signing of the Arms Trade \nTreaty, the first ever international treaty to regulate the \ntrade of conventional weapons.\n\nAnother security issue is the presence of landmines \nand other explosive remnants of war, which continue to \npose constant threats to human security and safety and \nhinder national development. To counter those threats, \nlast year in Phnom Penh the leaders of the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) decided to \nestablish the ASEAN Regional Mine Action Center and \nto base it in Cambodia.\n\nFor its part, Cambodia has spared no effort to address \nthe issue of landmines. To that end, it has established \ndemining and clearance of other unexploded ordnance \nas an additional MDG of its own. Substantial progress \nhas been made in realizing that goal, as is demonstrated \nby the sharp decline in the number of mine explosion \naccidents in Cambodia, from over 300 cases in 2008 \nto 186 in 2012. As Chair of the Eleventh Meeting of \nthe States Parties to the Mine Ban Treaty, or Ottawa \nTreaty, Cambodia made a strong commitment to work \ntowards a world free of landmines and unexploded \nordnance. Since 2006, Cambodia has contributed to \nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations by sending \nmine-clearance experts to a number of countries in \nAfrica and the Middle East, including the Sudan, \nSouth Sudan, the Central African Republic, Chad and \nLebanon, and very soon to Mali.\n\nOn the situation in the Korean peninsula, we \nwelcome the positive developments between North \nKorea and South Korea, which, I hope, will lead to a \nsignificant improvement in inter-Korean relations and \nthe resumption of the Six-Party Talks. We encourage the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to comply fully \nwith its obligations to cease its nuclear programme, as \nspelled out by the relevant Security Council resolutions.\n\nMy country reaffirms its support for the Palestinian \npeople\u2019s just demand for a sovereign and independent \nState of Palestine and for the two-State solution to the \nPalestine-Israel conflict. We urge all parties to play a \nconstructive role in the efforts aimed at resuming peace \ntalks and to remove any obstacles standing in the way \nof such resumption.\n\nWith regard to the Syrian situation, Cambodia \nstrongly condemns human rights violations and the \nuse of chemical weapons. My delegation fully supports \nSecurity Council resolution 2118 (2013), adopted on \nFriday with the aim of destroying Syria\u2019s chemical \nweapons.\n\nMy delegation also calls for an end to the unilateral \nembargo on Cuba, which has caused the Cuban people \ndecades of untold suffering.\n\nWe are seriously concerned about the extensive \nlevels of sexual violence inflicted on innocent women \nand children in armed conflicts around the world. \nMy country endorses the declaration of commitment \non ending sexual violence in conflict, issued on \n24 September at a side event during the general debate.\n\n\n\n\f\nSince the establishment of the United Nations, in \n1945, the world situation has changed so dramatically that \nthere is an urgent need to strengthen global diplomacy. \nIn that context, the reform of the United Nations should \nbe comprehensive and include not only the Security \nCouncil but also other organs, so as to maintain the \nOrganization\u2019s relevance as a global governance \ninstitution that can cope effectively with world reality. \nThe General Assembly should be empowered to play a \ngreater leading role in strengthening the wider United \nNations system, improving international governance \nand enhancing multilateralism. At the same time, \nthe Economic and Social Council should also be \nstrengthened, so that it can effectively coordinate \ninternational cooperation and efforts to tackle social \nand economic challenges. Both the permanent and \nnon-permanent membership categories of the Security \nCouncil should be expanded in an equitable manner, \nso that the Council represents both developed and \ndeveloping countries. A comprehensive reform of the \nCouncil to make it a body where real negotiations and \ncompromises can take place is acutely needed.\n"

        "file_text": "I \nshould like to depart slightly from protocol and start \nmy statement by speaking about a humble woman, a \nColombian named Mar\u00eda Zabala, who has to bear the \nburden of immense pain in her heart day in and day \nout. Two decades ago, armed members of illegal groups \narrived outside her house located on the Colombian \nCaribbean coast, determined to impose their rule \nof terror. In front of her and her small children, they \nmurdered her husband and two other relatives. They \nforced her to leave her house and then they burned \neverything down. She barely managed to remove the \ncorpses from the ashes. She buried them right there \nand fled from her parcel of land with her children \nand without any belongings. All she carried was the \nimmense weight of her tragedy.\n\nToday, Mar\u00eda Zabala is a courageous and inspiring \nleader, a leader of victims, who is working for peace \nin my country. In Colombia, sadly, there are many \nthousands of cases like Mar\u00eda Zabala\u2019s. It is estimated \nthat over the past 50 years, over 220,000 people died \nbecause of the conflict. That is more than twice the \ndeath toll of the Bosnian war in the former Yugoslavia, \nwhich was an open and ruthless conflict that moved the \nentire world. And to that, we would have to add the \ninjured, the people mutilated by anti-personnel mines, \nthose who have suffered the infamy of kidnapping and \nthose uprooted from their own land, who could amount \nto almost 5 million people.\n\nThat is the harsh and ugly reality of a conflict that \nunfortunately persists to this day. It is the oldest and \nthe last conflict in the western hemisphere. In spite \nof the conflict, Colombia has achieved unprecedented \nprogress in recent years on matters of security, in \nthe fight against poverty and inequality, and in its \neconomic performance. We have achieved much \u2014 a \ngreat deal \u2014 in the midst of a confrontation. Imagine \nhow much more we could have done without the \nconfrontation. And I must confess to the Assembly that \nfor me, as the head of the Government, it would have \nbeen easy to continue to move forward on the path that \nwe were on and to leave the conflict unresolved, because \nwaging war \u2014 and I know how to wage war \u2014 is easier \nthan seeking peace.\n\nIt would have been easier, but not responsible, \nbecause continuing to coexist with the conflict would be \nlike sentencing millions of people to many more years \nof violence, fear, poverty and victimization. It would \nnot be responsible towards Latin America or towards \nthe world, as they also suffer, in different ways, from \nthe effects of the Colombian conflict. And it would not \nbe responsible towards my own conscience, because we \nhave the best possible opportunity before us today \u2014 a \nreal opportunity, and maybe the last \u2014 to put an end \nto the conflict. I could not die in peace if I failed to do \neverything within my power to seize the opportunity \npresented. \n\nMy generation has not seen a single day of peace, \nand my dream is for my children and the children of all \nColombians to have the opportunity to know peace. I \nhope that the guerrilla forces understand that the time \nhas come to leave this 50-year confrontation behind; \nthat the time has come to move from bullets to votes, \nfrom weapons to discussion; that the time has come for \nthem to continue their struggle, but within democracy.\n\nToday, before the General Assembly, we Colombians \nwant to thank the international community for the \nsupport we have received in the endeavour to bring an \nend to our conflict through dialogue. With the world \nas our witness, we wish to assert our right to achieve \nthe peace. We are tired of being afraid, we are tired of \nviolence, we are tired of a conflict that pits the children \n\n\n\f\nof the same nation against each other and delays our \ndevelopment. Mar\u00eda Zabala is one victim among many, \nall of whom are entitled to justice, truth and reparations \nand to not seeing history repeat itself. That is what we \nare working on in our country.\n\nMy Government has promoted our most ambitious \nbill yet, recognizing and compensating victims in the \nmidst of a conflict. I had the honour of ratifying that bill \nin the presence of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. But \nour commitment goes beyond serving the victims of the \npast; our most urgent obligation today is to eliminate \nthe possibility of new victims being claimed by the \nconflict. Our obligation is to end the conflict now and \nto ensure that the spiral of violence and pain will not \ncontinue to recur. We are doing that in accordance with \nour democratic tradition \u2014 of course respecting, as we \nalways have, the rule of law \u2014 and in compliance with \nour international obligations. We wish to achieve an \nend to our conflict without relinquishing justice, much \nless the truth and due care of the victims. \n\nI take this opportunity to offer my thoughts to the \nGeneral Assembly on the role of the United Nations and \nthe multilateral organizations in our peace process and \nits future implementation. The subject is relevant and \ncurrent, since Colombia is possibly the first country in \nthe world to engage in a process of that nature since \nthe entry into force of the Rome Statute, which will \nmake us a model for other cases where dialogue is given \npriority over armed solutions, as should be the case. \n\nFormer United Nations High Commissioner for \nHuman Rights Louise Arbour of Canada recently stated \nthat international doctrine had not been successful \nin finding practical answers as to how to resolve the \nreal tension that exists between peace and justice in \na negotiation process. Ms. Arbour recalled examples, \nsuch as International Criminal Tribunals for the \nFormer Yugoslavia and Rwanda, which had been given \nimmense resources but had yielded very poor results.\n\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, \nestablished in 1994, has managed to dispose of only \n40 cases out of the nearly 800,000 murders committed \nin a single year. In 20 years, the International Criminal \nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has resolved barely \n100 cases.\n\nTherefore, how can we simultaneously achieve \nthe end of armed conflict, fulfil our obligation to \ninvestigate and prosecute and realize the rights of \nvictims? That dilemma must be confronted with \nhonesty and seriousness, and that is what we are doing \nin Colombia.\n\nWe have adopted an integrated strategy for \ntransitional justice that addresses the issues of truth, \njustice and reparations, which we hope will enable \nus to make the transition towards peace. We can say \nthat we have been pioneers in the implementation of \ntransitional justice measures in the midst of conflict, \ngiving priority to satisfying the rights of victims. No \none in my country wants the perpetuation of violence.\n\nWhat we are asking from the United Nations and \nthe international community is that both Colombia\u2019s and \nevery nation\u2019s right to seek peace be respected We ask \nfor continued support in that effort, along with respect \nfor our decisions and our approach, with confidence in \nthe fact that our actions have never deviated from the \nvalues of the international community.\n\nWe cannot investigate every action committed over \nhalf a century of violence, prosecute each and every one \nof those responsible and then find ourselves unable to \nfollow through. But what we can do is to build a realistic \nand transparent strategy that may satisfy the rights of \nall the victims in the best possible way. If we understand \njustice and the fight against impunity in a transition as \na set of measures aimed at satisfying the victims and \nnot just as the administration of criminal processes, \nit will be possible to find a comprehensive solution \nfor everyone. I refer to measures such as genuinely \nestablishing the facts of events, the acknowledgment \nof responsibility, the recovery of trust, access to \nreparations, and measures aimed at ensuring that there \nwill be no recurrence. In that way justice becomes \u2014 as \nit should be \u2014 a support for, rather than an obstacle to, \npeace.\n\nI want to be clear: there will be no impunity for \ncrimes against humanity or war crimes committed \nin a systematic fashion. On the contrary, this is the \nfirst time that Colombia is seriously assuming the \nobligation of fighting impunity for crimes committed \nin our armed conflict. The purpose is not to sacrifice \njustice to achieve peace, but rather to achieve peace \nwith maximum justice. I am saying that out of deep \nconviction. There is much at stake, that is, no less than \nan end to the half-century long conflict, as well as the \nfate of 47 million Colombians.\n\nWe have been involved in talks for one year \nnow, but we have reached agreements on just one of \nthe six items on the agenda. I am still optimistic, but \n\n\n\f\nthe patience of the Colombian people is not infinite. \nThe guerrillas will have to decide whether they opt \nfor an honourable and lasting peace, or whether they \nwill continue to wage war. From this rostrum, I call \nupon them to understand that history has led us to this \ndecisive moment. The time for decisions has come. If \nwe leave empty-handed, we will doom our nation to \nmany more years of bloodshed and pain. We cannot \nmiss this opportunity.Future generations and history \nwill not forgive us.\n\nMoreover, our conflict, with all its violence and \ncruelty, has been affected by a poisonous scourge that \nfuels it and is fuelled by it: drug trafficking. That illicit \nactivity has been the main funding source for violence \nand terrorism in my country \u2014 and I would say in the \nwhole world as well in recent times. Without the grim \ninfluence of drug trafficking, which fuels the fires of \nour war, I am certain that the war would already have \nended. That is why we have included the topic of illicit \ndrugs as a specific item in the agenda of the discussions \nwith the guerrillas.\n\nIf we manage to have the guerrillas change sides, \nonce they have demobilized, and become an ally of \nthe State in order to definitively curb drug trafficking \nand eliminate illegal crops, just imagine what could \nbe accomplished. A Colombia without coca crops and \nwithout a conflict was once a utopia and an impossible \ndream, but it is one that we can now realize for the \nbenefit not only of Colombians but of the whole world.\n\nAlmost a half century ago, in this very place, the \nConvention that gave birth to the war on drugs was \nadopted. Today we must recognize that that war has not \nbeen won. I say that as the President of the country that \nhas suffered the most deaths, the most bloodshed, the \nmost sacrifices in that war, and also the country that \nhas achieved the most results in the fight against this \nscourge and the mafias that underpin it. \n\nLast year, when chairing the Summit of the \nAmericas, fully aware of that dilemma, I led a proposal \nto debate and explore different scenarios in the fight \nagainst the global drug problem, aimed at evaluating \nwhat we are doing and at seeking ways to be more \neffective. We commissioned the Organization of \nAmerican States to conduct studies with experts, \nacademics and people with different approaches on \nhow to face the problem. Those studies were delivered \nto us in May. Different Governments are evaluating \nthem and they should serve as inputs for discussions at \nall universities and think tanks, and in the context of \ndifferent forums, not just from Latin America but from \nthe whole world, because it is a global problem that \nrequires a global solution. Because of that \u2014 because \nit is a global problem \u2014 we expect their conclusions \nto also be discussed in this body, the United Nations, \nwhich has already called for a special session on the \ndrug problem to be convened in 2016. \n\nIf we act together on the drug problem and adopt a \nnew, modern and comprehensive vision that is free of \nideological or political bias, imagine how much harm \nand violence we will be able to prevent. I am not just \nspeaking about harm to people, but also harm to nature, \nbecause drug trafficking has become a major destroyer \nof our tropical forests and forests in general, in what \ncan be termed a veritable ecocide.\n\nColombia is deeply committed to environmental \nprotection. At the Rio de Janeiro Conference on \nSustainable Development, we put forward the proposal \nto establish sustainable development goals as a \nmandatory benchmark in the development agenda for \nthe coming decades. We are taking an active part in \nthe design of those goals, and they can and should \nbe incorporated into a visionary and ambitious \ndevelopment agenda for all countries as of 2015. In fact, \nwe were a member of the High-level Panel on the Post-\n2015 Development Agenda, convened by the Secretary-\nGeneral and co-chaired by the Prime Minister of the \nUnited Kingdom, David Cameron, which has already \npresented its report. \n\nColombia, for its part, is continuing to do a great \ndeal. For example, a few weeks ago, we doubled the \narea of the largest national park in Colombia, the \nChiribiquete National Natural Park, located in the very \nheart of our Amazon region. We designated that area a \nnatural reserve and prohibited mining and deforestation \nactivities in an area roughly the size of Belgium, and \nnot just in any place, but in the area where the Amazon \nregion has the greatest biological and cultural diversity. \n\nThis very morning we are launching, with the \nPrime Minister of Norway and five other countries, \nthe New Climate Economy initiative. With the support \nof the most respected research institutes, we will seek \nthe best way of making economic efficiencies and the \nfight against poverty compatible with the preservation \nof the environment. In that way we are shouldering our \nresponsibilities with respect to climate change, which \nhas already had an impact on Colombians. We will \n\n\n\f\nprotect the sources of oxygen and water necessary not \njust for Colombia\u2019s survival but that of the entire planet.\n\nI will conclude by stating that in my country we are \nworking and will continue to work to prevent the plight \nof Mar\u00eda Zabala and millions of other victims from ever \nrecurring. Never again! I hope that the President of \nColombia will come to the Assembly next year bearing \nthe good news that the conflict has come to an end.\n"

Germany supports the United \nNations as the beating heart of a global order rooted \nin cooperation, peaceful compromise and cooperative \nsolutions.\n\nThe world has changed dramatically since then. \nNew centres of economic and political power are \nemerging. In recent years, Germany has established \nnew strategic partnerships with the new global players \nin Asia, Latin America and Africa.\n\nThe setting of our meeting today is different \nfrom the usual one. The United Nations is undergoing \nrenovation, which must not be restricted merely to the \nbuildings. The United Nations must reflect the world \nas it is, not as it used to be. Only then will it be fit for \nthe challenges of our age. A Security Council without \npermanent seats for Africa and Latin America does \n\n\n\f\nnot reflect the realities of today\u2019s world. A Council in \nwhich the emerging and highly populous region of Asia \nis represented by only one permanent seat does not \nreflect the realities of today\u2019s world. Nor does it reflect \nthe reality of tomorrow. Germany, with its partners \nJapan, India and Brazil, is prepared to assume greater \nresponsibility. In essence, it is a matter of strengthening \nthe United Nations. The authority of the United Nations \ndepends on its being representative.\n\n\nWe are seeking reform of the United Nations so that \nits power to build consensus, establish global rules and \nact effectively in response to crises and conflicts can \nbe demonstrably strengthened. This is a call not only \nto the United Nations itself, but also to each and every \nindividual Member State. Only if we are prepared to \ncompromise and are willing to act together will we \nbe able to make the United Nations strong. Germany \nremains committed to the United Nations. A strong \nUnited Nations is in Germany\u2019s interests.\n\nOur cultural differences and diverse traditions are \nnot going to vanish in the age of globalization, but it \nis not only the world\u2019s markets that are becoming ever \nmore closely interconnected: people\u2019s expectations, \nhopes and ideas are globalizing too. The developments \nin the Arab world have shown us that a country\u2019s \nstability depends primarily not on the stability of \nthe Government but on social stability. The best \nguarantees for a society\u2019s internal cohesion are respect \nfor individual human rights, the triumph of the rule \nof law over the arbitrary, and broad economic, social \nand political participation on the part of the people. \nGermany is committed to democratic change and to \nrespect for human and civil rights, not because we want \nto take the moral high ground but because we have \nlearned from experience \u2014 from the painful experience \nof our own history.\n\nIn Syria the people took to the streets to protest \nagainst a repressive regime. For more than two years \nnow, the regime\u2019s response has been brutal violence, \nwhich has brought countless deaths, immeasurable \nsuffering and terrible destruction on the Syrian \npeople and is now jeopardizing stability in the entire \nregion. The use of chemical weapons, ascertained by \nthe United Nations, is a crime against civilization. Its \nterrible dimensions have consequences that extend far \nbeyond Syria. All the facts available to us show that the \nregime is responsible for the use of chemical weapons.\n\nThe use of chemical weapons cannot be allowed to \ngo unpunished. That we owe not only to the victims in \nSyria, but also to future generations. Those responsible \nfor using such weapons must be called to account \nbefore the International Criminal Court, which must at \nlast be able to begin its independent investigations. We \nwelcome the agreement reached in the Security Council \nyesterday. The chemical weapons in Syria must be \ncompletely destroyed in accordance with a firmly \nagreed timetable. Germany is prepared to provide \nfinancial and technical help to destroy those chemical \nweapons. A world without weapons of mass destruction \nwould be a better world.\n\nWe must take advantage of the opportunity for a \npolitical process offered by the agreement on destroying \nthe chemical weapons. After all, people in Syria are \nstill being killed every day by conventional weapons. \nBut there will be no military solution in Syria. Only a \npolitical solution can bring lasting peace to Syria. That \nwould include an immediate ceasefire. I am pleased \nthat there is at last a timetable for a possible peace \nconference, details of which still have to be clarified \neven after yesterday\u2019s decision in the Security Council. \nOnly with a substantive political process can we counter \nthe destabilization of the entire region.\n\nTo date, Germany has made available more than \n\u20ac420 million to ease the worst of the suffering of the \nSyrian people. But despite all of the outside help, \nmillions of Syrians are fleeing. Ever more people are \nat acute risk of starvation, and very soon they will also \nbe at the mercy of the cold weather. They do not have \neven the most basic medical care. We must seize every \nopportunity to provide humanitarian access to the \nsuffering population as quickly as possible. Amid all \nthe devastation and hatred, the United Nations and its \nstaff are the face of compassion and, for many Syrians, \nthe only hope. I would like expressly to pay tribute to \ntheir work and commitment.\n\nThe tragedy in Syria underlines the extraordinary \nand growing importance attached to disarmament \naimed at eliminating weapons of mass destruction and \nthe strengthening of the non-proliferation regimes. \nAttaining a world free of weapons of mass destruction is \nour generation\u2019s prime task for the future. Disarmament \nis a crucial issue for the future of humankind.\n\n\n\f\nIran must allay the international community\u2019s \ndoubts about the exclusively peaceful nature of its \nnuclear programme. We welcome Iran\u2019s announcement \nthis week that it is prepared to do so. The talks with the \nIranian Government were encouraging. They open up \na window of opportunity. Now it is imperative that we \nrebuild trust. Germany is ready to conduct negotiations \nin a constructive manner. However, the new words \ncoming out of Tehran must be followed by deeds, and \nnot at some unspecified time in the future, but right \nnow. But, I repeat: a fresh start has been made.\n\nWe welcome the great commitment shown by \nPresident Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry \nin giving fresh impetus to the negotiations between \nIsrael and the Palestinian leadership. Prime Minister \nNetanyahu and President Abbas deserve our respect \nfor their courage in embarking together on that course. \nThey have our full support as they pursue that course \ntowards a negotiated agreement. Only a negotiated two-\nState solution can reconcile the legitimate interests of \nthe two sides.\n\nThis week in New York has been an encouraging \none for the world. I am gratified that it was not military \nsolutions but the struggle for political and diplomatic \nsolutions that came to the fore. The international \ncommunity must continue to follow such an approach.\n\nBeyond crisis diplomacy, the United Nations is \nthe central forum for setting binding objectives for \nthe international community. Just a few days ago, the \nGeneral Assembly agreed on the next steps for drawing \nup a new post-2015 sustainable development agenda. \nGermany wants to make a contribution in that regard \nwith its experience of combining economic prosperity \nand promoting political participation and sustainable \nmanagement.\n\nSustainability and combating poverty are not only \nkey social issues; they are also key foreign policy issues.\n\nIn formulating the future agenda, greater attention \nneeds to be paid to human rights protection and good \ngovernance than has been the case in the past. The \nnew agenda must incorporate all three dimensions of \nsustainability and take account of economic, social and \nenvironmental aspects. With such a comprehensive \napproach we can also strengthen the fragile statehood \nin many countries and eradicate safe havens for \nterrorists. Social stability is the best protection against \nradicalization and extremism.\n\nGerman foreign policy is a policy for peace. It \nfocuses on crisis prevention. We Germans accept our \nresponsibility for international peacekeeping. We \nfocus on personal and social development. We focus on \nstrengthening civil society. We want to contribute to \na global process in which we \u2014 in the North, South, \nEast and West learn from each other and develop joint \nsolutions by working together. Germany will continue \nin future to use its economic clout and full political \nstrength to promote peace and the balancing of interests.\n\nThe digital age brings with it entirely new \nopportunities and challenges. We need an Internet in \nwhich freedom, security and the protection of privacy \nare appropriately reconciled. Just as we have to regulate \ninternational financial flows in order to prevent global \ncrises, so we need binding rules and standards for \nglobal data flows. That is why Germany has submitted \nto the Human Rights Council an initiative regarding \nthe protection of the right to privacy in the digital \nage. Everyone using the Internet should be able to be \nsure that their rights are being respected worldwide \nvis-\u00e0-vis private companies as well as vis-\u00e0-vis States. \nNot everything that is technically possible must be \nallowed to happen, nor is everything technically \npossible legitimate.\n\nGermany remains firmly anchored in Europe. \nEurope is a community of shared cultures, bound \ntogether by a common destiny. Close union among \nthe nations of Europe is and will remain the response \nto our history and to our future in a world of change. \nGerman foreign policy is firmly embedded in European \nforeign policy. Europe will continue to use its clout, \nits influence and its resources to uphold peace and \njustice, to encourage development and cooperation \nand to promote climate protection and disarmament \nthroughout the world.\n\nThat is Germany\u2019s twin obligation: a strong united \nEurope in the world and a strong, effective United \nNations for the world.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to begin \nby conveying my vigorous condemnation of the \nrecent terrorist attacks in Kenya, Pakistan and Iraq, \nwhich killed scores of innocent people. On behalf of \nthe Government of Timor-Leste, I extend our deepest \ncondolences to the bereaved families in connection \nwith the senseless loss of their loved ones. Terrorism is \ncontrary to every civilized value we hold dear and for \nwhich we have fought. It must be condemned in all its \nmanifestations, regardless of its motives.\n\nThis is the first time that I am addressing this \nAssembly of representatives of the international \ncommunity as a whole. I take this occasion to once \nagain thank the United Nations for its contribution to \nthe realization of the right of the people of Timor-Leste \nto decide on our own future. Timor-Leste\u2019s experience \nshows the great value of the United Nations and the \nimportance of negotiated solutions, dialogue and \ndiplomacy to international disputes.\n\nThis is the first year without a United Nations \nmission in the country since the restoration of Timor-\nLeste\u2019s independence 11 years ago. Our partnership \nwith the United Nations throughout the last decade \nachieved remarkable successes. The Timorese people\u2019s \nyearning for stability and peace was decisive for the \nnew circumstances, which allowed the Security Council \nto remove Timor-Leste from its agenda.\n\nThe results obtained are shared jointly by the \ninternational community, through their solidarity and \npioneering efforts in the nation-building processes \nmade in Timor-Leste, and by the Timorese people, \nthrough their maturity and firm determination to live \nin peace, which has been repeatedly expressed in free \nelections with a high voter turnout.\n\nI thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \nthe attention given to my country, which was again \nunderlined by his visit to Timor-Leste one year ago, \nwhich greatly honoured us.\n\nThe Timorese people now hold in their own hands \nfull responsibility for building their future. The country \nis facing the challenges with high hopes and optimism.\n\nOne such challenge is to focus national development \nefforts on diversifying the economy, reducing our \ndependency on oil and promoting inclusive development \nfor all Timorese people. Another is to consolidate our \nnational institutions, strengthening their technical \ncapacities and ensuring the participation of the younger \ngeneration in managing the country.\n\nThe older generations have incumbency and have \nthe duty to pass on to young people the wealth of values \ndeveloped during the liberation struggle, such as \nrespect for human dignity and dedication and service to \nthe country. Those values are as necessary to building \nan equitable society and a unified country today as they \nwere in the past to solidifying the unity of purpose of \nthe nation. The development of the country must not \nexclude any Timorese.\n\nThe relations between Timor-Leste and the United \nNations will continue to strengthen and will increasingly \nfocus on assistance in the area of human, social and \neconomic development efforts and the strengthening of \ninstitutions.\n\nThe international integration of the country \ncontinues to evolve at a good pace, guided by the goal of \ncontributing to a peaceful and stable international system \ncapable of promoting social and human opportunities \nfor all peoples. We are participating actively in the \ndevelopment of new forms of dialogue among fragile \nStates by establishing the Group of Seven Plus (g7+). \nThat group, over which Timor-Leste currently has the \nhonour of presiding, comprises 18 countries committed \nto promoting a new model of engagement between \nfragile States and other international stakeholders. The \nNew Deal for Engagement in Fragile States, promoted \nby the g7+, has been well received by the United Nations, \ndevelopment partners and international organizations. \nThe initiatives of the g7+ and the dynamic relationship \nof the group with development partners contributes \n\n\n\f\nto the establishment of more innovative and effective \ninternational relations and cooperation.\n\nThe latest report on the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) states that most countries will not \nachieve all the MDGs, and that is particularly true \nin the case of fragile and conflict-affected States. \nThe international community as a whole must draw \nlessons from that as we plan for the future. Many of \nthe world\u2019s poorest have been left behind, including \naround 1.5 billion people across the globe who live in \nareas affected by fragility and conflict. That is why the \ng7+ countries came together with the following vital \nmessage: without peace there can be no development \nand without development there can be no peace. And \nto add a further dimension to that, there can be neither \npeace nor development without inclusive and responsive \nState institutions that are capable of being responsive \nand attending to people\u2019s needs.\n\nAt the regional level, we have established friendly \nrelations with neighbouring countries in South-East \nAsia and the Pacific, in particular with Australia \nand Indonesia, our closest neighbours, with whom \nwe maintain intense cooperation. The process of \nreconciliation between Timor-Leste and Indonesia \nand the excellent relations that our two countries have \ndeveloped represent a model whose lessons are useful \nand relevant beyond our borders and outside our region.\n\nTimor-Leste has submitted its application for \nmembership in the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations. We have developed friendly relations with \nall member States of that organization, which makes \nrelevant contributions to stability in our region. Our \ncountry is a member of the Non-Aligned Movement \nand a special observer at the Pacific Islands Forum. We \nplay an active role in and are committed to multilateral \nprocesses, which are important for regional stability \nand security.\n\nThe unanimous election of Timor-Leste to chair \nthe Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the \nPacific by the countries members of that United Nations \nbody reflects my country\u2019s harmonious international \nintegration. As a member of the Community of \nPortuguese-speaking Countries, we will have the \nhonour of chairing that organization in the period 2014-\n2016. Timor-Leste believes in making its voice directly \nheard in every multilateral forum of relevance to our \nnational interest and will submit an application for \nmembership in the Commonwealth of Nations.\n\nTurning our attention to international matters \nwhose urgency especially appeals to our conscience, \nmy country has witnessed with horror the growing \nviolence in Syria. We welcome the agreement that was \nreached to put Syria\u2019s arsenal of chemical weapons \nunder United Nations control prior to its destruction. \nTimor-Leste rejects the use of chemical weapons in \nall circumstances. We are in favour of dialogue in the \nsearch for negotiated solutions, with the involvement \nof the United Nations. Only negotiation can help save \nlives and alleviate the high toll that the Syrian people \nare paying in human lives and social upheaval, which \nhas resulted in millions of internally displaced persons \nand refugees.\n\nIn Timor-Leste, we know only too well the losses \nand traumas of war. We are committed to preventing \nviolence in all its forms. Earlier this month, our Prime \nMinister, Mr. Kay Rala Xanana Gusm\u00e3o, joined the \nChampions initiative to end sexual violence in conflict, \nsupporting the corresponding action launched by the \nUnited Nations.\n\nIn a world undergoing a rapid transition towards \nglobalization, the Security Council must upgrade \nits ability to effectively respond and must adjust its \ncomposition to better reflect the realities of the twenty-\nfirst century. New Powers, including India, Indonesia \nand Brazil, among others, must be granted permanent \nmember status in the Security Council. At the same \ntime, my country is aware of the need for a better \nrepresentation of medium-sized and small countries \nwith relevant contributions to stability and peace. In that \nspirit, Timor-Leste supports New Zealand\u2019s candidacy \nfor a non-permanent seat at the Security Council for \nthe 2015-2016 term. New Zealand has actively worked \nwith us for peace and security in Timor-Leste, and \nwe believe it will both enhance the representation of \nsmall States and be a constructive bridge-builder at the \nCouncil.\n\nOn 30 August, Timor-Leste celebrated the \nfourteenth anniversary of the referendum supervised \nby the United Nations that allowed the Timorese \npeople to realize their right to self-determination and \nindependence. In contrast, there are peoples who, after \ndecades, continue to patiently wait for the realization \nof that right. Such is the case of the Sahrawi people. A \nstable and lasting solution for Western Sahara cannot \nexist without the democratic expression of the will of \nits people.\n\n\n\f\nWe commend the decision of the leaders of \nthe State of Israel and the Palestinian Authority to \nresume direct talks under the auspices of the United \nStates Government. Timor-Leste supports the right \nof the peoples of Palestine and Israel to live side by \nside in peace, with dignity and in safety. We hope that \nthe peace talks already initiated may at last lead to a \nsolution with two sovereign States coexisting in an \nenvironment of mutual respect and rejecting extremism \nand violence. We condemn the building of settlements \nin the occupied territories and all unilateral initiatives \ncontrary to resolutions of the United Nations.\n\nWe believe in dialogue, openness and inclusion as \na means of strengthening confidence in international \nrelations. Therefore, we call for an end to the embargo \nagainst the Republic of Cuba, an embargo that does not \ntake into account the reality of today, of the country or \nof the Cuban people. We also call on President Barack \nObama to act in accordance with his powers and release \nthe four Cuban citizens, from an initial group of five, \nwho have been incarcerated for over a decade in North \nAmerican prisons.\n\nAllow me now to address the situation in Guinea-\nBissau, a sister nation to Timor-Leste in the Community \nof Portuguese-speaking Countries currently \nexperiencing an easing of political and social tensions, \nwhich we hope will lead to the re-establishment of \ninstitutional normalcy and democracy. We welcome the \nefforts of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding \nOffice in Guinea-Bissau, which were led by my \npredecessor as Head of State of Timor-Leste, Mr. Jos\u00e9 \nManuel Ramos-Horta. His initiatives have helped to \nenhance the prestige of the United Nations among the \npeople of Guinea-Bissau and to create an environment \nof greater trust and dialogue in the country. The \nproblems of Guinea-Bissau can be solved. Timor-\nLeste will continue to support the patient efforts of the \nGuinean people and the international community aimed \nat intensifying dialogue and reconciliation among the \npeople of Guinea-Bissau and promoting a democratic \nsolution within an appropriate time frame. \n\nAmong the critical global challenges facing \nhumankind today, I want to highlight the severity of \nmalnutrition, which affects hundreds of millions of \npeople worldwide. The dual challenges of improving \nfood security and reducing malnutrition on a \nglobal scale require a renewed boost from all of us, \nincluding development partner countries. Without \nnew coordinated initiatives and greater investment to \npromote improving food security and the fight against \nmalnutrition, it will not be possible to make rapid \nand sure progress towards attaining the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. The new objectives are defined in \nthe post-2015 development agenda, due to be launched \nby Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.\n\nTimor-Leste is following, with great interest, \nthe post-2015 development agenda process and was \nhonoured by the invitation to Dr. Emilia Pires, our \nMinister of Finance, to participate in the High-level \nPanel that drafted a proposal for the agenda, following a \nrequest by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\n\nThe past experience of the Timorese people and the \ncountry\u2019s liberation struggle, in which we were engaged \nfor 24 years, have demonstrated that only tolerance, \ndialogue and mutual respect, which the Timorese \nresistance consistently showed and I have consistently \nsupported \u2014 in short, veneration for the dignity of \npeople \u2014 will allow us to reach durable solutions to \ndisputes between countries.\n\nIn a world where challenges are rapidly becoming \nglobalized, requiring concerted and effective responses, \nthe actions of the United Nations are more than ever \nessential for the stability of international relations. \nTimor-Leste will continue to show its commitment \nto the United Nations, so that the Organization may \nbetter respond to the desires of Member States and the \nchallenges they face, and to unhesitatingly assert the \nvalues of peace and mutual respect. I wish the Assembly \nthe best of luck in its work. \n"

        "file_text": "I \nshould first like to congratulate you, Sir, an outstanding \npublic servant from our region, on his recent election \nto preside over the General Assembly. I would also \nlike to express my heartfelt solidarity with the people \nand Government of Mexico in the wake of the storms \nthat have seriously affected their country, and with \nthe people and Government of Kenya, after the acts \nof terrorism that have had such a terrible impact. I \nwould also like to emphasize that during this period of \nmeetings, Heads of State and Government from almost \nall corners of the planet will have the opportunity to \nexchange views, share experiences and, most important, \ngenerate the momentum essential to building together a \nfuture commensurate with the ideals, dreams and hopes \nof the men and women represented here.\n\nThe fundamental inspiration behind the founding \nof the United Nations, almost seven decades ago, was \nthe desire to be able to depend on a place designed to \nbring into harmony the actions of every nation aimed \nat attaining peace and development, a place where all \nindividuals, nations and peoples of the world \u2014 whatever \nflag they pledge to honour, whatever god they worship \nand whatever ideas they embrace \u2014 can feel part of one \nbig family, the human family.\n\nThat requires many things of us, but none so \nimportant as holding an open, free and respectful \ndialogue among ourselves, a dialogue that, far from \nfearing dissent, values it and is nourished by it, because \nit understands that only when the various nations and \ncultures join forces will we also see our opportunities \nexpand.\n\nWe are living in a world that is very different from \nthe one that witnessed the birth of the Organization and \nof other agencies such as the International Monetary \nFund and the World Bank after the end of the Second \nWorld War. This new world is not the result of war or \nof the ideological struggles waged during the second \nhalf of the twentieth century; rather, it is the child of \na revolution in knowledge, science, technology and \ninformation that has been taking place for some time \nand that is now knocking at our doors and creating \nopportunities for material and spiritual progress for \nmillions of men and women around the world that many \nof us could not have imagined even a few decades ago. \nThis new world is no longer divided by walls or iron \ncurtains, but is connected and integrated by the bridges \nof increasing globalization and the massive exchange of \ngoods, services, capital and people. \n\nIn this new world we certainly face dangers, \nchallenges and opportunities that are also new, and which \nin many cases transcend the borders and jurisdictions \nof individual countries, demanding to be tackled by \ndistinguishing where the responsibility of some people \nends and where the responsibility of others begins. \nSuch challenges and problems can be successfully \ndealt with only by harnessing the force of the unity of \nall and the responsibility of each. However, although \nwe know we are living in a world that is undergoing \nenormous transformations, many of our international \norganizations often seem resistant to the change that \nsuch an evolution demands, allowing themselves to fall \nbehind instead of leading the process.\n\nArticle 1 of the Charter of the United Nations \nstates that the principal purposes of the Organization \ninclude to maintain international peace and security, \nto develop friendly relations among nations and to \npromote international cooperation in the economic, \nsocial, cultural and humanitarian spheres, as well as \nrespect for human rights and the permanent protection \nof human freedoms without distinction as to race, sex, \nlanguage or religion. But let us be clear. None of those \ndesires is exclusive to one nation, one era or one specific \norganization: they all emanate from the depths of our \n\n\n\f\nsouls and of each human heart. For that reason, we are \nnot here only to proclaim their value and existence \nbut to ensure their enforcement and application. We \ntherefore appeal not for those values to be changed or, \nstill less, to be forgotten. Quite the contrary: we appeal \nfor the will and the courage to put them into practice. \nIn order to do so, we must perfect our democracies and \nstrengthen grassroots participation, but we must also \nmodernize our regional and global organizations. In \nthat task, as we all know, there is a long road ahead of \nus.\n\nA good first step in that direction is to move \ntowards real and far-reaching reform of the Security \nCouncil, including the enlargement of its permanent \nand non-permanent membership to ensure proper \nregional representation, as well as to strengthen its \ntransparency. working methods and decision-making, \nall aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and legitimacy \nof its activities.\n\nIn that regard, Chile, which was present at the \ncreation of the Organization in 1945, supports the \ninclusion of Brazil, Germany, Japan and India as \npermanent members of the Security Council, as well as \nthe African continent\u2019s request for fair representation \nin the Organization. And we join in the appeals to the \nfive countries with the right of veto to refrain from \nexercising that right in situations of crimes against \nhumanity, war crimes, genocide or ethnic cleansing, \nsince the use of the veto in such cases prevents or \nundermines the Council\u2019s efforts to effectively defend \nthe most fundamental values that enable humankine to \nadvance. \n\nHowever, Security Council reform is not limited \nto changes in its membership and organization. It also \nmeans abandoning the logic of vetoes and replacing \nit by a logic of special quorums, so that the most \nimportant decisions concerning international security, \nwhich inevitably affect all countries sooner or later, can \nbe adopted in a way that is truly representative of the \ncommunity of nations that make up the United Nations. \nIn the end, if we advocate democracy, dialogue and \nparticipation when we govern our own countries, we \nshould advocate for those same principles when we \naddress the form in which the United Nations governs \nitself. \n\nI should like to take this opportunity also to express \nmy gratitude for the many expressions of support for \nChile\u2019s candidacy as a non-permanent member of the \nSecurity Council in the next two years and to reaffirm \nour strongest commitment to the principles and values \nthat have for decades governed and guided our foreign \npolicy. I mention in particular our full, unconditional \nrespect for international law, the inviolability of \ntreaties, legal equality among States, the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes and the self-determination \nof peoples \u2014 all values that provide the essential \nfoundation for international stability and peaceful \ncoexistence among nations. In our opinion, however, \nthose values should be complemented by the principle \nor notion of the responsibility to protect. That concept \nholds that it is the primary duty of each State to protect \nthe population within its borders. And if a State cannot \nor does not want to comply with that primary duty, then \nthe international community can and should intervene \non the basis of three universally recognized pillars, \nnamely, prevention, support and the proportional use \nof force in accordance with the Charter of the United \nNations, but only as a last resort and when strictly \nessential to prevent, avoid or deter genocide, war \ncrimes, ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity.\n\nIn addition, my country once again reaffirms its \nstrongest commitment to democracy and respect for the \nhuman rights of all persons, from their conception to \ntheir natural death, at all times and in all places and \nall circumstances, as well as our ongoing endorsement \nof multilateralism, of a regionalism that is open to \nthe world, and of fair and constructive economic \ncompetition among all countries. \n\nIn that regard, we reiterate our appeal not only to \nend the proliferation of nuclear arms and weapons of \nmass destruction but also to dismantle those that already \nexist. We strongly condemn the use of the chemical \nweapons in Syria, as well as the indiscriminate use \nof force against the civilian population, which has to \ndate produced tens of thousands of innocent victims, \nincluding women and children, and has caused a \nserious humanitarian crisis that represents a wound \nto our universal conscience and seriously threatens \ninternational peace and security. \n\nWe therefore welcome and strongly support the \nframework agreement for the elimination of chemical \nweapons in Syria, concluded recently by the United \nStates and Russia, as well as the efforts made by the \nSecretary-General and the Joint Special Envoy of the \nUnited Nations and the League of Arab States to reach \na peaceful and lasting solution to this prolonged armed \nconflict as soon as possible.\n\n\n\f\nSimilarly, Chile has always defended and will \ncontinue to defend the cause and rights of the \nPalestinian people to have a full, free and democratic \nState \u2014 a State that, like the State of Israel, enjoys \nagreed, recognized and secure borders with all its \nneighbours, allowing its inhabitants to live and develop \nin stable and lasting peace and security. We therefore \nrecognized Palestine as an observer member of the \nUnited Nations and hope very soon to welcome it as a \nfull Member of the Organization.\n\nWith regard to regional matters, in March \n2012, Chile ratified the Protocol on Commitment to \nDemocracy, adopted by the member countries of the \nUnion of South American Nations, and we hope that it \nwill enter into force as soon as possible. In addition, we \nhave reiterated our commitment to the Inter-American \nDemocratic Charter and shall work tirelessly for the \ncause of democracy, freedom and the full respect for \nhuman rights in all the countries on our continent and \nthroughout the entire world.\n\nChile has also assumed the presidency pro tempore \nof the Community of Latin American and Caribbean \nStates and hosted the first summit of its 33 members, \nat which we signed the Santiago Declaration, in which \nthe entire region stated its commitment to democratic \nvalues and respect for human rights. In addition, we \nheaded the first joint summit of the Heads of State \nand Government of Latin America, the Caribbean and \nEurope, at which nations on both sides of the Atlantic \nOcean undertook to promote sustainable development \npolicies in order to encourage high quality investments \nof both social and environmental value.\n\nIn the social sphere, although two years still remain \nbefore the deadline set at the Millennium Summit, we \ncan announce with great satisfaction that Chile has \nattained practically all the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) set by the Organization in 2000. We \nare nevertheless redoubling our efforts to attain the \nremaining goals by 2015, and working to ensure that the \ncountries that have requested our help can also achieve \nthem. We are also participating actively in the efforts at \nthe United Nations to define a new global sustainable \ndevelopment agenda beyond 2015 that follows on the \nMDGs and establishes specific, measurable, bold \nand feasible responsibilities, both for developing and \ndeveloped nations, with special attention being given \nto ensuring that economic development is compatible \nwith social development and the protection of the \nenvironment.\n\nIn addition, Chile, together with Mexico, Colombia \nand Peru, took part in co-founding the Pacific Alliance, \none of the most far-reaching integration initiatives in our \nregion, designed to promote an area for the free flow of \nnot only of goods, services and capital but also of persons, \nthus allowing higher growth rates and development and \ngreater opportunities for our countries and peoples. We \nare delighted to see that the Pacific Alliance, which \nrepresents a population of over 210 million, one third \nof Latin America\u2019s gross domestic product and more \nthan half of its foreign trade, has, despite its recent \nemergence, already achieved significant results and is \nincreasingly attracting the interest of the international \ncommunity, which can be seen in the fact that it has \nattracted more than 20 observer countries, including \nAustralia, Canada, China, Spain, the United States and \nJapan.\n\nLastly, I should like to mention the recent approval \nby the National Congress of my country of legislation \nsubmitted by the Government that abolishes tariffs on \nimports from the least developed countries, as defined by \nthe United Nations. That is an important demonstration \nof the Chilean people\u2019s solidarity with and commitment \nto the development of almost 50 countries in Africa, \nAsia, Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nA few days ago, Chileans marked the fortieth \nanniversary of the most far-reaching and lasting \nupheaval ever to affect our democracy in our two \ncenturies of independent life and which ushered in a \nperiod characterized by hatred, division and exclusion \nnot only in Chile but also in a world torn apart by the \nCold War. However, in a few days\u2019 time, on 5 October, \nwe shall be marking another anniversary in Chile \u2014 the \ntwenty-fifth anniversary of the start of the peaceful \nrecovery of our democracy by the free and sovereign \nwill of a vast majority of Chileans, which has allowed \nus to recover our democracy in a wise and peaceful \nmanner and with the advice and consent of all sectors \nof our country. From both experiences, Chileans have \nlearned lessons that I should like to share with the \nAssembly today because I humbly believe that they can \nshed light on how to resolve conflicts that are negatively \naffecting other nations of the world today.\n\nThe first lesson is that we must acknowledge \nwithout reservations of any kind that even in extreme \nsituations, including external or internal warfare, there \nare moral and legal rules that must be respected by all \nand that can never be ignored without falling into a \nserious and unacceptable moral vacuum. Among those \n\n\n\f\nrules, there is the strict respect for the human rights of \nall, in every time and place, under all circumstances. \n\nThe second lesson is that the values of democracy, \npeace and civil amity are much more fragile than we \nusually think, so we cannot, and should never, take \nthem for granted. They are somewhat like a tree that \nneeds to be watered every day in order not to wither and \ndry up. Such care must be provided not only in deeds \nbut also in words, gestures and formal actions, because \nall of them can and must be placed at the service of \ntruth, justice, reconciliation and peace. \n\nThe third lesson is that there is a very close \nrelationship among the quality of democracy, economic \nprogress and social justice, since all of them are mutually \nreinforcing and since the decline of one of them would \nsooner or later have an adverse effect weakening the \nothers. Our task, therefore, is not only to strengthen our \ndemocratic institutions but also to promote economic \nand social policies based on freedom, responsibility, \njustice, equality of opportunity and the fight against \npoverty, and based on uniting the forces of both private \nand public initiative and respect for fundamental \nrights, because such policies are the main engines of \ndevelopment of our nations and peoples.\n\nThe fourth lesson that we have learned in our country \nis that the past is over. We can discuss it, interpret it \nand, of course, remember it, but we cannot change it, \nand therefore we have no right to remain prisoner to it, \nbecause when the present is anchored in the past, the \nonly thing we lose is the future. For that reason, our \ngeneration, which is celebrating the bicentennial of our \ncountry, has no right to bequeath to future generations \nthe same hatreds, quarrels and divisions that caused so \nmuch harm and suffering 40 years ago. The challenge, \nthen, is not to forget but to overcome the past with a new, \npositive and hopeful outlook, trying to learn from past \nexperience in order to avoid making the same mistakes \nand letting it illuminate the way to the future, and to \nface with greater resolve and efficiency the problems \nand opportunities of the present and the future.\n\nThose and other lessons painfully learned by Chile \nenabled us to recover our democracy peacefully and to \nmove forward over the past 25 years on the paths of \ntruth, justice and reconciliation among all Chileans. \nBut that was an old transition, one that, I believe, we \naccomplished successfully. Today we Chileans are \nfacing another transition. This is a new, young and \nforward-looking transition that, before the end of this \ndecade, will allow us to turn Chile into a developed \ncountry that overcame poverty and became fully \nintegrated into the community of democratic and \ndeveloped nations. Those are the commitments that the \nGovernment that I have the honour to lead made to all \nChileans almost four years ago. We are deeply gratified \nto observe the solid and sustained progress of Chile \ntowards their fulfilment.\n\nDespite the devastating earthquake and tsunami \nthat struck us in 2010 \u2014 at the time, the fifth most \nserious in the known history of humankind \u2014 and the \nglobal economic crisis that began in 2008 and is not \nover, Chile has resumed its leadership, momentum and \nability to create jobs and strong growth. For example, \nour per capita gross domestic product, which four years \nago was about $15,000, now stands at $20,000. Poverty \nand inequality are declining and real wages are rising \nrapidly. All indicators show that in key spheres such as \nquality education and health, we are making progress in \nthe right direction, further stimulating innovation and \nentrepreneurship and better protecting our consumers, \nworkers and the environment. \n\nAt the same time, we have rebuilt virtually 90 per \ncent of everything destroyed by the earthquake and \ntsunami. Obviously, our Government is very proud \nof the contribution that its policies have made to \nthe attainment of those goals. But we have no doubt \nthat most of the credit goes to all Chileans, men and \nwomen, who have made enormous contributions to \narrive at this point. If there is something that we \nin Chile have learned it is that in order to be able to \ngrow and to reduce poverty and excessive inequalities, \nnothing works better than to rely on the skills of people \nthemselves, expanding their freedoms and unleashing \nthe forces of imagination, creativity, innovation and \nentrepreneurship that lie within the hearts of each of \nmy compatriots and also \u2014 I am sure \u2014 the hearts of \nevery man and woman around the world.\n\nThose are some thoughts and lessons that I, both as \nPresident of Chile and as a citizen of the world \u2014 wanted \nto share with Heads of State and Government. Those \nare the lessons and thoughts of a country that may be \nsmall on the international stage and remotely located \non the world map, but that today enjoys a stable and \nconsolidated democracy, broad and guaranteed public \nfreedoms and an economic system that, after two \ncenturies of republican life, has finally brought us to \nthe threshold of development.\n"

I assure him that the Tongan \ndelegation will be fully supportive and cooperative \nunder his very able leadership. I also wish to commend \nthe stewardship of his predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremi., \nduring the sixty-seventh session. I express my gratitude \nto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his persevering \nguidance and energetic leadership in further enhancing \nthe profile and work of the United Nations in the face of \nunprecedented global challenges.\n\nTonga welcomes the timely theme for the general \ndebate, \u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: setting the \nstage\u201d, and the inclusion of a set of six thematic issues of \nfocus for high-level events and thematic debates during \nthe sixty-eighth session. Indeed, Tonga joins other \nsmall island developing States (SIDS) in affirming that \npriorities in the outline of the post-2015 development \nagenda should, with increased cooperation among \nMember States, reflect the outcome of the 2014 Third \nInternational Conference on Small Island Developing \nStates, to be convened in Samoa.\n\nTonga supports the proposed high-level event that \nwould address the needs of women, youth and civil \nsociety and contribute to development goals. It applauds \nthe high-level event on the contribution of human rights \nand the rule of law to the post-2015 framework and hails \nthe twentieth anniversary of the Vienna Conference on \nHuman Rights. Earlier this year, Tonga submitted its \nsecond universal periodic review, which was adopted \nby the Human Rights Council. The next review for \nTonga is scheduled for 2017-2018.\n\nThe high-level event, centring on South-South \nand triangular cooperation, including information \nand communication technology, is appreciated as \nadding value to the realization of development targets. \nTonga hosted the annual Pacific Islands Chapter of \nthe Internet Conference earlier this month to celebrate \nthe emergence of high-speed Internet connectivity in \nTonga. The Conference showcased the achievements \nof the Pacific region in accessing opportunities for \nInternet users and demonstrated how Tonga can best \n\n\n\f\ndevelop its own investment strategy for the new cable \nsubmarine Internet system.\n\nThe thematic debate on partnership deserves high \npraise, in particular with the aforementioned Samoa \nConference focusing on the overarching theme of the \nsustainable development of small island developing \nStates through genuine and durable partnership. The \nsecond thematic debate, on the establishment of stable \nand peaceful societies, is also welcome, given the \ncurrent chaos we are experiencing in the international \ncommunity. The third thematic debate, on the roles \nof water, sanitation and sustainable energy, is equally \ncrucial to the development agenda for the post-2015 \nperiod.\n\nEnergy is the golden thread that connects economic \ngrowth, increased social equity and an environment \nthat allows the world to thrive. Sustainable energy is \ncentral in order to reach the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs), including many development goals that \nextend far beyond the energy sector \u2014 eradicating \npoverty; increasing food production; providing clean \nwater; improving public health; enhancing education; \ncreating economic opportunity; and empowering \nwomen \u2014 as well as an integral part of creating \nsustainable development, including environmental \nsustainability. A shift towards more sustainable energy \nsources is also essential in addressing environmental \nsustainability while tackling climate-change challenges.\n\nThe concept of establishing a Pacific Regional Data \nRepository for Sustainable Energy for All is aimed at \nfocusing on all energy-related projects to be sourced, \nincluding all projects implemented in the Pacific, \nreflecting best practices as well as those that have not \nbeen so successful.\n\nThe lack of bankable data in the region causes a \ndisconnect from the true value of assistance from our \ndevelopment partners, whereby 60 per cent of project \nfinancing is absorbed by technical assistance, pilot \nprojects, pre-feasibility studies and only 40 per cent, and \nin some cases less, on hardware. The Pacific Regional \nData Repository for Sustainable Energy for All has an \nambitious goal of implementation whereby the Pacific \nsmall island developing States, with the assistance \nof their developing partners, will gift to the Third \nInternational Conference on Small Island Developing \nStates, to be held in 2014 in Samoa, a documented \nprocess under which this has been achieved and which \nmay be shared by all regional groups of the United \nNations.\n\nI therefore urge all relevant stakeholders to work \ntogether to develop and establish a common global goal \non sustainable energy for all as part of the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda.\n\nA set of related targets and indicators supporting \nthe goal should encompass all three dimensions of \nsustainable development. The three objectives of the \nSustainable Energy for All Initiative \u2014 universal \nenergy access, increased efficiency and renewable \nenergy \u2014 can provide a solid framework to build on \nfurther, while keeping them fully adaptable to different \ncircumstances and priorities at the regional, national \nand local levels.\n\nTonga commends the Secretary-General for his \nlaudable initiative to convene a high-level summit \nmeeting on climate change in 2014 and joins other SIDS \nin urging the leaders of developed countries to enhance \ntheir mitigation ambition to bridge the pre-2020 gap \nin a timely and effective manner. Furthermore, Tonga \njoins other SIDS in calling for the inclusion of climate \nchange as a cross-cutting issue in terms of sustainable \ndevelopment goals. Oceans are a thematic priority and \nshould also be prominently featured in the context \nof sustainable development goals and the post-2015 \nagenda.\n\nThe Government of Tonga has adopted the \nUnited Nations Development Programme Millennium \nDevelopment Goals Acceleration Framework and \nhas chosen to apply it to MDG 6, on combating \nnon-communicable diseases, with applications to MDG \n1, on poverty, and MDG 3, on gender equality.\n\nThe following five key interventions have been \nprioritized in Tonga to combat non-communicable \ndiseases: increase the local food supply and create \nincome-generating opportunities for women and \nvulnerable groups; provide curative health services in \nhospital settings, screening for disease-specific risk \nfactors; review legislation, subsidiary legislation and \npolicies affecting food, tobacco, kava, alcohol and \nphysical activity; advocate healthy lifestyles through \nchurches and workplaces; and support resources.\n\nTonga\u2019s Millennium Accelerated Framework report \nis completed and ready for launching and, moreover, \nis aligned with the call of SIDS for non-communicable \n\n\n\f\ndiseases and other emerging health issues to be \nhighlighted in the post-2015 development agenda.\n\nTonga joins other delegations of the international \ncommunity in urging a swift and peaceful resolution to \nthe situation in Syria.\n\nWith respect to pertinent regional issues, Tonga \nendorses the views expressed in the Marshall Islands \ncommuniqu\u00e9, that is, the outcome document of the \nannual meeting of Pacific Island Forum leaders, held \nearlier this month.\n\nMay God continue to bless and guide the States \nMembers of the United Nations as they take their \ncrucial work forward.\n"

I wish to congratulate \nAmbassador John Ashe on his election as President and \non his guidance of the proceedings so far.\n\nIn 2014, we will mark the United Nations \nInternational Year of Small Island Developing States. \nMr. Ashe\u2019s appointment during the sixty-eighth session \nis highly symbolic of the constructive role that small \nisland developing States play within the United Nations, \nand we express our full support for his efforts to further \npromote inclusiveness and full participation.\n\nI would also like to join all those who preceded me \nin complimenting Mr. Vuk Jeremi. on his leadership \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, \nduring which he stressed the unifying elements of the \nAssembly. Allow me to also express our appreciation to \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the determination \nand commitment he has shown since the beginning \nof his tenure of office to strengthening the role of the \nUnited Nations.\n\nFor the Seychelles delegation, the General \nAssembly evokes the spirit of humanity\u2019s common \ncause better than any other institution. Indeed, in this \nHall, we are reminded that there are no large nations \nor small nations, rich nations or poor nations, powerful \nnations or weak nations \u2014 simply the United Nations.\n\nAs a small island developing State, we are perhaps \nalso more conscious than most countries that very \nlittle can be achieved through isolation. Our economy \nis built around its connectivity to the world economy. \nOur security is easily undermined by events beyond our \ncontrol. Our environmental safety is also dependent on \nmany factors that have an impact beyond our borders. \nBoth our opportunities and our risks can be addressed \nonly through international partnerships.\n\nAs we have discussions and exchanges of ideas on \nthe post-2015 development agenda, we believe that the \nexperiences of our group of States provide contexts that \ncan help us to design a better development model. As \nwe aim to set sustainable development goals, we must \nkeep in mind that, if we can sustain our island, then we \nwill know that we can sustain our planet.\n\nIn 2013 Seychelles was given the honour to host \nthe Atlantic, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean and South \nChina Seas Sub-Regional Preparatory Meeting for \nthe Third International Conference on Small Island \nDeveloping States, to be held next year in Samoa. \nThe participation in the preparatory event by both \nthe Under-Secretary-General of the Department of \nEconomic and Social Affairs and the President of the \nGeneral Assembly was highly appreciated as a symbol \nof support for the concerns of islands. Our discussions \nthere, and in the ongoing process, have highlighted the \nfact that there is an urgent need for the United Nations \nto adopt a \u201cresilience\u201d that takes into account the \nevolving developing needs of islands.\n\nIn Rio last year, we identified the green economy \nand the blue economy as tools with which States may \nimplement a more sustainable approach to development. \nWe are convinced that the green economy cannot be \nproperly addressed unless we also give more attention \nto what is termed the blue economy, which is based on \nharnessing the development potential of our oceans \nsustainably. Oceans make up 72 per cent of our planet \nand connect our nations in terms of geography, trade, \ntransport and communications. We consider island \nnations such as ourselves as guardians of that space, \neven if in many cases we can but be witnesses to \nplunder, pillage and pollution.\n\nThe status quo merely perpetuates a model where \nwe will consume our planet\u2019s resources with no long-\nterm protection, while the menace of climate change \ncontinues to grow as a threat to our economies, our way \nof life and our existence.\n\nTo further mobilize reflection and action on the \nconcept of the blue economy, Seychelles is pleased to \nbe able to organize, in partnership with the United Arab \nEmirates, a special high-level event to be held as part \nof the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week on 21 January \n2014. The blue economy also represents an unparalleled \nopportunity for Africa. As an African island nation, we \nhave continued to call for more attention to be given to \nthe sustainable development of Africa\u2019s coastal areas \nand its oceans. We can transform Africa\u2019s oceans from \nbeing sources of raw products for distant nations to a \nspace where Africa\u2019s trade needs are prioritized and \nwhere Africa can better protect its oceanic resources.\n\n\n\f\nAs an African island State, Seychelles continues to \nprioritize the security of our maritime spaces. In terms \nof maritime security, Seychelles reiterates its desire \nto build partnerships to create better coordination and \nsharing of information in the immediate region and \nbeyond.\n\nSeychelles has also set up a Regional Anti-Piracy \nProsecution and Intelligence Coordination Centre, and \nit also hosts an anti-piracy cell of the Indian Ocean \nCommission to build the maritime security capacity \nof the island States. The tools we have developed \nthrough such initiatives have strengthened our ability \nas a region to deter other criminal activities, such as \narms trafficking, drug trafficking, people trafficking \nand illegal fishing. We look forward to building on \nthose successes with our partners in order to create \nan effective coordination mechanism for maritime \nsecurity in our region.\n\nAs we consider the security situation in East \nAfrica, may I also take this opportunity to express our \nsolidarity and our sympathy to the Government and \nthe people of Kenya, as well as personally to President \nUhuru Kenyatta, as Kenya recovers from the barbaric \nattacks in Nairobi on Saturday.\n\nSuch acts of terrorism strengthen our resolve to \nensure that we build a shared future free of the forces \nof division and hostility. We also salute the efforts of \nthe Government of Somalia in its dedication to ensure \nthat forces of extremism and intolerance have no place \nin our shared region.\n\nSimilarly, we are encouraged by the positive \ndevelopments in relation to the expected first round \nof presidential elections to be held in Madagascar in \nOctober. Elections represent the path towards resolving \nthe crisis in that neighbouring island, and we are \nencouraged that the basis for the resolution of the crisis \ndiscussed during the Southern African Development \nCommunity mediation, with the support of the Indian \nOcean Islands Commission, held in Seychelles in the \nyear 2012, have come to fruition.\n\nDuring the sixty-eighth session, Seychelles will \ncontinue to be an advocate for peace and stability and \nwill urge all nations to work through the mechanisms \nof the United Nations towards resolving existing \ncrises. Seychelles condemns in the strongest terms \nany use of chemical weapons or any other weapon of \nmass destruction. As one of the first signatories of the \nArms Trade Treaty, Seychelles also urges all nations to \nactively engage in that treaty process so as to reduce the \nrisk of arms trades, which remains one of the biggest \nchallenges for our region and the world.\n\nFinally, during the sixty-eighth session, Seychelles \nwill continue to call for every effort to be made to \nreduce the marginalization of island States, and it is in \nthat context that we reiterate the call for the removal of \nthe embargo against our brotherly nation of Cuba.\n\n\nSeychelles is a nation that believes that all voices \ncount. In speaking out on behalf of small islands that \nare often marginalized in international processes, we \nbelieve that we have a duty to ensure that all perspectives \nare considered. It is because of our commitment to \nthat inclusive approach to the United Nations and \nto multilateralism that Seychelles has announced its \nintention to stand as a candidate for a non-permanent \nseat on the Security Council for the period 2017-2018. \nAs a nation that has never served before, we are actively \nengaged in discussions in our East African constituency, \nand we appreciate the opportunity to engage with all \nnations that wish to share their views. We look forward \nto many fruitful discussions.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize that our \napproach towards the sustainable development goals \nmust be even broader and more inclusive than for the \nMillennium Development Goals. The challenges are \nobvious: poverty, climate change and energy, among \nothers. The list can go on indefinitely, but we believe \nthat there is also a shared opportunity in setting the \nsustainable development goals. There is an opportunity \nto reflect the true interconnectivity of our planet \nthrough the adoption of interconnected objectives. \nShared objectives will lead to shared success. That is \nthe conviction of Seychelles.\n"

        "file_text": "There are two years left \nuntil the deadline for achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. It is therefore time to review what \nwe have succeeded in achieving and set the guidelines \nfor the work that remains.\n\nDevelopment is a global challenge. Every \ncontribution that is made, every experience that we \nshare and every lesson that we have learned is very \nimportant for all of us. By sharing we set the stage for \nlearning from each other \u2014 and not only from our own \nmistakes. In today\u2019s world, every country has the right \nto choose a path that best suits its experience, culture \nand needs, as long as it does not infringe upon the rights \nof others and guarantees human rights and freedoms. \nThe international community has an obligation to \noffer support based on the principles of ownership and \nempowerment so that those choices may be realized.\n\nDevelopment cannot be imposed; it must be \npromoted. But it is not only about development. It is \nabout free choice, democracy and fundamental rights, \neach of which is key to the success of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and the post-2015 development \nagenda. \n\nToday we live in the twenty-first century, but there \nare still those who want to enforce a specific course \nof development on others, using economic pressure, \nenergy levers or cybertools, by distorted information \nor threats. It is true that internationally approved \nsanctions send a message to those who are producing \nweapons and not jobs, who violate human rights and \nuse national resources to satisfy individual interests \nand not those of their society as a whole. But the use of \neconomic, energy or information tools to show power \nor set up zones of influence is unjustifiable, especially \nfor the future.\n\nThe twenty-first century should be the age of \nsolidarity, equality and sustainable development. It \ncannot be an age of the flaunting of power, zero-sum \ngames or buffer zones. Those times are over. Any attempt \nto return to those times impedes the development of the \nmodern world. But, regrettably, power games still exist.\n\nI would like to share my country\u2019s and region\u2019s \nexperience with the Assembly. In the past two decades, \nthe Baltic States have been rapidly transformed. Complex \nand painful economic, political and social reforms \nhave boosted economic growth, social well-being and \npolitical stability. After rebuilding our statehood two \ndecades ago and with the help, advice and experience \nof the international community, our nations have today \nbecome donors and have a lot of experience to share \nwith those who are going through transformations \nsimilar to the ones we have experienced. \n\nInner resolve and consensus are very important. \nHowever, a favourable external climate and \ninternational support are also needed, especially for \nsmall countries that depend on larger players for their \ntrade, transportation or energy links.\n\n\n\nIn two months\u2019 time, in Vilnius, several Eastern \nEuropean countries intend to confirm their commitment \nto completing the painful but much-needed reforms \nfor economic growth, political stability and social \nharmony. For many years, those countries worked \nhard to reach national agreement on reforms, their \nscope and direction. They learned from their mistakes \nand mobilized resources to build their own futures. \nThey chose to build modern States of the twenty-first \ncentury \u2014 open, transparent and collaborative, not \ndominating.\n\nIt was not easy for those countries to decide which \ncourse to take. Their choice would have been made easier \nif their free will had been respected and their decision \nsupported in good faith, and with encouragement by \nthose who could provide such support. Instead, they \nare now facing trade restrictions, bans on goods, the \n\n\n\f\nmanipulation of energy prices, the use of pressure and \nopen disrespect displayed in information forums.\n\nThe countries of the European Union Eastern \nPartnership are not the only ones experiencing such \nproblems. Even Lithuania, which holds the presidency \nof the Council of the European Union and has \nsuccessfully consolidated its course of development, is \nunder similar pressure. Barriers to travel, unreasonable \ndelays in cargo transportation, the milk wars \u2014 those \nare just a few very recent controversial examples. For \nnations, the decision is really difficult to make when free \nchoice means being threatened with gas-price increases \nand blocked trade, instead of receiving support and \nadvice. Under such pressure, it is hard to implement \nreforms that empower members of society and open up \nopportunities to engage in the state-building process.\n\nThe post-2015 development agenda must provide \ninstruments that empower States to seek development, \nbased on free will and their individual needs. There is no \nplace for forced choices, open threats or demonstrations \nof power. The international community, especially the \nUnited Nations, should empower States to realize such \nself-determination. I urge us all to give the matter our \nvery careful attention.\n"

Let me also pay tribute to Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon and thank him for his tireless efforts \nand leadership in promoting the ideals and principles \nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. \n\nThe ideal and principle to which we should aspire \nis creating a world in which everyone can live free from \nfear, free from want and in dignity. The United Nations \nhas achieved many extraordinary successes in the past, \nbut we also have to acknowledge some disappointing \nand frustrating setbacks and failures. I believe that now \nmore than ever, the United Nations must play a major \nrole in international relations. We live at a time when \nthe balance of global power is changing in a rapid and \ndramatic way. Thus far in history, this kind of global \nchange has never ended without a global conflict. We \nestablished the United Nations precisely in order to \nprevent such a conflict in future.\n\nLess than 20 years ago, we witnessed events that \nshocked our human conscience: genocide in Rwanda, \n\n\n\f\nfollowed by genocide in Srebrenica and Darfur. We \nshould have learned lasting lessons from those horrific \nevents. We vowed never to let that happen again. We \ncollectively endorsed the responsibility to protect \nhuman beings from mass atrocities and gross and \nsystematic violations of human rights, and yet we have \nfailed again. \n\nWe are faced with another human tragedy unfolding \nbefore our eyes in Syria. After more than two years of \nbrutal violence against civilians, including women and \nchildren, we still have not found a political solution \nwithin the framework of the United Nations. Not only \nis the unconscionable use of chemical weapons in Syria \nconsidered a war crime, it is an assault against our \ncommon humanity. \n\nSovereignty as responsibility implies that States \nare responsible for the well-being of their citizens. It \ndoes not give them a licence to kill their own citizens. \nIf States manifestly fail to protect their populations, \nthe international community has a duty to react. When \nfaced with mass atrocities, indifference is not, and \ncannot represent, an option. The report of the United \nNations inspectors was clear, credible and impartial. \nThe United States-Russian agreement on the framework \nfor the elimination of Syrian chemical weapons must \nbe implemented without delay. Syria\u2019s accession to the \nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development, \nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons \nand on Their Destruction is a positive step. Syria \nshould comply immediately and fully, or face the \nconsequences. \n\nIt is important that diplomacy prevailed and \nreferred the issue back to the United Nations and the \nSecurity Council. The Security Council should live up \nto its responsibility and use all appropriate measures \nto comprehensively address the situation in Syria. \nReaching a political settlement remains the only \nviable and lasting solution to the crisis and to ensuring \nstability in the region. We support the timely convening \nof the \u201cGeneva II\u201d conference.\n\nThe Security Council has the primary responsibility \nto maintain international peace and security under \nthe Charter of the United Nations. It exercises that \nresponsibility on behalf of all of us. It has an obligation \nto deliver and to fulfil the mandate entrusted to it by \nthe international community. In this period of tensions \nand challenges, the responsibility of the major Member \nStates is especially great. In recent years we have \nwitnessed too many divisions in the Council, which have \nimpeded its ability to act in a timely manner. Decisive \nprogress in Security Council reform is required to \nimprove the Council\u2019s efficiency, transparency and \naccountability. As part of that effort, the permanent \nmembers should consider refraining from the use of the \nveto in situations of genocide, crimes against humanity \nand serious violations of international humanitarian \nlaw.\n\nWe call upon the Security Council to refer the \nsituation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. \nThe International Criminal Court is an essential pillar \nin the system of international justice and a powerful \ntool to ensure accountability and to fight against \nimpunity for the most serious crimes. It deserves our \nfull support.\n\nWe must focus more closely on addressing the \nroot causes of conflicts and expand our work on \nprevention. In particular, we must improve our ability \nto read the warning signs and trigger early action. The \nconsequences of inaction far outweigh any risks that \nmight arise from timely prevention and response, in \nterms both of money and \u2014 more important \u2014 human \nsuffering and lives. \n\nThat was a lesson learned in our neighbouring \nregion, the Western Balkans. Enhancing mutual trust \nthrough open political dialogue is a prerequisite for \npeaceful coexistence and long-term stability there. \nSlovenia and Croatia have therefore launched the Brdo \nprocess as a forum for high-level dialogue intended \nto strengthen relations and reconciliation among the \ncountries of the region.\n\nThe past century was a very dark chapter in \nEurope and in human history. In August 2014, we will \ncommemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the \noutbreak of the First World War. It brought about mass \ndestruction of human life and new methods of warfare \nthat were subsequently condemned by the civilized \nworld. It was followed by the Second World War, and \nthe century ended with a decade of intra-State conflicts \nand genocides that caused untold human suffering. \n\nLet us use our conscience and humanity as the \nweapon of choice, for everyone deserves to live in \ndignity and peace, feeling safe, with access to food and \ndrinking water and with a decent job and adequate pay \nfor it. Yet something so obvious seems to be very far \nfrom reality. It is our task to bring reality closer to our \ndreams.\n\n\n\f\nToday\u2019s world leaders have a unique opportunity, \npossibility and responsibility to influence our \ncommon future for many decades to come. That is \nwhy it is important not to lose focus on the successful \nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \nby 2015 and to agree on the post-2015 agenda. Let us \ntransform our vision of saving future generations from \nthe scourge of war into reality. We have no time to \nspare. We have no right to fail.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, \nI would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Vuk \nJeremi. on his outstandingly successful presidency of \nthe General Assembly at its previous session. I would \nalso like to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption \nof the presidency at its current session and to wish you \nevery success.\n\nI am pleased, indeed honoured, to address the \nAssembly today for the first time in the name of \nthe State of Palestine, following the Assembly\u2019s \nhistoric decision on 29 November of last year to raise \nPalestine\u2019s status to that of a non-Member Observer \nState. As representatives of their Governments and \npeoples, Members have championed justice, right and \npeace, while affirming their rejection of occupation \nand standing for principles and ethics and on the side \nof peoples yearning for freedom. For that, I once again \noffer my deepest thanks and gratitude today on behalf \nof Palestine and its people. The Palestinian people \ncelebrated resolution 67/19. They rightly felt that they \nwere not alone in the world and that the world stood \nwith them. They celebrated because they realized that \nthe overwhelming result of the Assembly\u2019s vote meant \nthat justice was still possible and there was still room \nfor hope.\n\nI assured the Assembly last year that our quest to raise \nPalestine\u2019s status was not aimed at delegitimizing an \nexisting State, the State of Israel, but at consecrating \u2014 I \nrepeat, consecrating \u2014 the legitimacy of a State that \nshould exist, which is Palestine. I have also affirmed \nbefore the Assembly that our quest was not intended to \naffect the peace process, nor is it a substitute for serious \nnegotiations. On the contrary, our quest is supportive of \nthe choice of peace and has revived a process that was, \nin truth, moribund. As we have repeatedly affirmed and \nproved in practice, the State of Palestine, which abides \nby the Charter of the United Nations and resolutions \nof international legitimacy, will exercise its role and \nuphold its responsibilities within the international \nsystem in a positive and constructive manner that \nreinforces peace.\n\nA new round of negotiations was launched a few \nweeks ago, thanks to the tireless and appreciated efforts \nof the President of the United States, Mr. Barack Obama, \nand of the United States Secretary of State, Mr. John \nKerry. I affirm before the Assembly today that we \nhave begun those negotiations and shall continue them \nin good faith and with open minds, strong will and \ndetermination and a sharp focus on success. I assure \nMembers that we shall respect all of our commitments \nand foster the atmosphere most conducive to continuing \nthe negotiations seriously and intensively, while \nproviding guarantees for its success and aiming at a \npeace agreement within nine months.\n\nAs we engage in a new round of negotiations, we \nmust remind everyone that we are not starting from a \nvacuum or from point zero, nor are we lost in a labyrinth \nwithout a map or a compass, at risk of losing sight of \nthe destination. The goal of the peace that we seek is \ndefined and the objective of the negotiations is clear \nto all, just as the terms of reference and the basis and \nfoundations of the peace process and of the agreement \nwe seek are longstanding and within reach.\n\nAs for the goal of peace, it is embodied in redressing \nthe historic, unprecedented injustice that befell the \nPalestinian people in the Al-Nakba of 1948. It is the \nrealization of a just peace, the fruits of which can be \nenjoyed by the Palestinian and Israeli peoples, as well \nas by all the peoples of our region.\n\nThe objective of the negotiations is to secure a \nlasting peace agreement that immediately leads to the \nestablishment of the independence of a fully sovereign \nState of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, \n\n\n\f\non all of the Palestinian land occupied in 1967, so that \nit may live in peace and security alongside the State of \nIsrael. The negotiations must also resolve the plight of \nPalestine refugees in a just, agreed-upon solution, in \naccordance with resolution 194 (III) and as called for \nby the Arab Peace Initiative.\n\nWe reaffirm our refusal to be drawn into the \nwhirlpool of a new interim agreement aimed at the \nperpetuation of an interim State with interim borders, \nor to enter into transitional arrangements that will \nbecome the fixed rule rather than an urgent exception. \nOur goal is to achieve a permanent and comprehensive \nagreement and a peace treaty between the States of \nPalestine and Israel that resolves all outstanding issues, \nanswers all questions and allows us to officially declare \nan end to the conflict and to all claims.\n\nThe terms of reference and parameters of the \nnegotiations, their goals and the basis of the agreement \nwe seek are all found in the Assembly\u2019s historic decision \nto upgrade Palestine\u2019s status, as well as in the countless \nresolutions of this body and of the Security Council \nand those of the League of Arab States, the European \nUnion, the Non-Aligned Movement, the African Union \nand the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. In fact, \nover the years, the parameters have become the basis \nof an international consensus, indeed, near unanimity.\n\nExactly 20 years ago, precisely on 13 September \n1993, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the \nsole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian \npeople signed, together with the Government of Israel, \nthe Declaration of Principles Agreement on the White \nHouse lawn in Washington, D.C, in the presence of our \ndeparted leader, Yasser Arafat, and Yitzhak Rabin, \nthe late Israeli Prime Minister, the King of Jordan and \nformer President Bill Clinton. \n\nSome five years earlier, on 15 November 1988, \nthe Palestinian National Council had adopted our \nprogramme for the achievement of peace, thereby \ntaking an extremely difficult decision and making a \nhistoric, painful and harmful concession. However, as \nrepresentatives of the Palestinian people, and having \nlong been aware of our responsibilities to them, we \nmustered the necessary courage to accept a two-State \nsolution, namely, Palestine and Israel on the borders \nof 4 June 1967 and the establishment of a Palestinian \nState on 22 per cent of the land of historic Palestine. \nThus we realized our part in achieving a historic \nsettlement, upheld our obligations and fulfilled all of \nthe requirements from the Palestinian side as set by the \ninternational community, in order to attain peace.\n\nAt the same time that the PLO affirmed its choice of \npeace as a strategic option and a solution resulting from \nnegotiations, the PLO firmly repudiated violence and \naffirmed an ethical, principled rejection of terrorism \nin all its forms and manifestations \u2014 especially State \nterrorism \u2014 while affirming respect of international \nhumanitarian law and United Nations resolutions.\n\nAs a genuine historic breakthrough, the signing \nof the Oslo Accords led to an unprecedented political \nmovement that fostered great hopes and generated \nhigh expectations. The PLO worked with dedication to \nimplement the Accords in order to end the occupation \nand to realize a just peace. However, 20 years on, the \npicture appears dispiriting and bleak: great dreams have \nbeen shattered and goals have become more modest. \n\nAs much as we felt in those days that peace was \nat hand, today we realize how far we are from it, for \nthe goal of the Accords has not been achieved, its \nprovisions have not been implemented and its deadlines \nhave not been respected. All the while, ongoing intense \nsettlement construction, which aims to change the facts \non the ground in the occupied Palestinian territory, has \nviolated the spirit of the agreement, struck at the core \nof the peace process and caused a deep fracture in its \ncornerstone, that is, the two-State solution.\n\nThe start of a new round of negotiations is good \nnews, but it cannot serve as grounds for complacency \nor an exaggerated sense of tranquility on the part of \nthe international community. The negotiations we \nare undertaking today with the Israeli Government \nunder the auspices of the United States require that \nthe international community exert every effort to \nmake them succeed, namely, through international and \nregional organizations and individual States upholding \nthe international consensus on the goal of peace, the \nobjectives of the negotiations, the terms of reference \nand the basis for a permanent peace agreement.\n\nHowever, at the same time, the international \ncommunity is asked to remain vigilant. The international \ncommunity must condemn and put an end to any actions \non the ground that would undermine negotiations. In \nthat regard, I refer above all to the continuation of \nsettlement construction on Palestinian land, particularly \nin Jerusalem. There is an international consensus \namong the countries of the world, international and \nregional organizations and the International Court \n\n\n\f\nof Justice on the illegality and illegitimacy of those \nsettlements. The position of the European Union with \nregard to settlement projects is a positive model of what \ncan be done to ensure an environment supportive of \nand conducive to negotiations and the peace process. \nIt is also imperative that the near-daily attacks on the \nreligious sites in occupied Jerusalem, the foremost of \nwhich is the Al-Aqsa Mosque, cease, as the continuation \nof such attacks will have dire consequences.\n\nHistory is the best teacher. It teaches us that waging \nwar, imposing occupation and building settlements \nand walls may provide temporary quiet and temporary \ndomination, but they certainly do not ensure real \nsecurity or guarantee sustainable peace. Such policies \nmay create a specific reality on the ground, but they \ncertainly do not create a right or provide legitimacy. \nSuch policies may impose weak stability, but they \ncannot prevent the inevitable explosion, because such \npolices in fact fuel situations that are already inflamed \nand cause them to explode. Above all, such policies are \nincapable of extinguishing the aspirations of a people \nfor freedom, and cannot eradicate their living memory \nor their narrative.\n\nTherefore, what is required now is to heed the \nlessons of history, to abandon the mentality of force \nand occupation, to recognize the rights of others \nand to work on an equal footing and in full parity to \nachieve peace. What is required is to stop relying on \nexaggerated security pretexts and obsessions in order to \nconsecrate occupation and to stop contriving demands \nthat push the conflict out of its defined political arena \nand towards the abyss of religious conflict in a region \nburdened with such sensitivities. That is something that \nwe categorically reject.\n\nI am confident that the Israeli people want peace \nand that a majority of them support a two-State solution. \nWe have always expressed our firm positions and have \nalways explained them at the negotiations table with the \nIsraeli Government and in the meetings and contacts \nthat we have intensified in recent years with a wide \nspectrum of actors from Israeli society.\n\nOur message is rooted in the idea that the two \npeoples, the Palestinians and Israelis, are partners in \nthe task of peacemaking. That is why we keep reaching \nout to the Israeli side, saying: let us work to make the \nculture of peace reign, to tear down walls, to build \nbridges instead of walls and to open wide roads for \nconnections and communication. Let us sow the seeds \nof good-neighbourliness. Let us envision another future, \none that the children of Palestine and Israel enjoy in \npeace and security, where they can dream and realize \ntheir dreams, a future that allows Muslims, Christians \nand Jews to freely reach their places of worship, and a \nfuture in which Israel gains the recognition of 57 Arab \nand Muslim States, the States of Palestine and coexists \nin peace and each of their peoples can realize their \nhopes for progress and prosperity.\n\nWhile we discuss the realization of peace between \nPalestine and Israel as an imperative to achieve a \ncomprehensive peace between the Arab countries and \nIsrael in accordance with United Nations resolutions, \nwe bear in mind the current volatile reality and \nunprecedented dynamics besetting our region. \nPalestine does not interfere in the internal affairs of \nArab countries, but we have clearly affirmed our stance \nin support of the demands of the peoples of our region, \ntheir choices and their peaceful popular movements to \nachieve those demands, along with the programmes and \nroad maps they have adopted to reach their goals. \n\nFurthermore, while we have condemned the crime \nof the use of chemical weapons in Syria, we have \naffirmed our rejection of a military solution there and \nstressed the need to find a peaceful political solution to \nfulfil the aspirations of the Syrian people.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the Palestinian \npeople were born in Palestine and were sent into exile \nafter the 1948 Al-Nakba. However, 65 years afterwards, \nthey continue to be its direct victims. Since the start of \nthis year, 27 Palestinian citizens have been killed and \n951 have been wounded by the bullets of the occupation, \nand 5,000 fighters for freedom and peace are currently \nbeing held captive in occupation prisons. Does anyone \ndeserve an end to this occupation and the realization of \na just and immediate peace more than the Palestinian \npeople?\n\nThis year and in the past few years, Palestinian \nrefugees, despite their neutrality, have continued to pay \nthe price of conflict and instability in our region. Tens \nof thousands have been forced to abandon their camps \nand to flee in another exodus, searching for new places \nof exile. Do the Palestinian people deserve justice less \nthan the rest of the peoples of the world?\n\nSince the beginning of the year, construction has \nbeen under way on thousands of settlement units by the \noccupation authorities, and construction tenders have \n\n\n\f\nbeen issued for thousands of others on our occupied \nland, even as additional vast areas of land are either \nexpropriated or declared off limits; 850 homes and \nstructures have been demolished.\n\nPalestinians are forbidden to plant on their own land \nand to use the majority of the area of our country, which \nis only 22 per cent. They are prevented from using their \nown country\u2019s water to irrigate their crops. The wall \nand checkpoints continue to tear apart the lives of the \nPalestinian people and to destroy their economy. The \nsiege is growing tighter, along with the attacks and \noppressive discriminatory measures against occupied \nJerusalem, its holy places and its citizens. In Gaza, \nfor years an unjust blockade has been imposed on our \npeople.\n\nSo is there any people more deserving of freedom \nand independence than the Palestinians? Since the \nbeginning of the year, 708 terrorist attacks have \nbeen perpetrated by settlers against our mosques and \nchurches, our olive trees, our agricultural fields and our \nhomes and property. Is there the shadow of a doubt in \nanyone\u2019s mind that the Palestinian people have the most \nneed of security?\n\nAlso, is there a nobler mission on the international \ncommunity\u2019s agenda than realizing a just peace in the \nland of the monotheistic faiths, the birthplace of Jesus \nChrist, the site of the ascent of the Prophet Muhammad \nand the resting place of Abraham, the father of the \nprophets?\n\nAs they remain steadfast on their land, the \nPalestinian people also continue to build their \ninstitutions, to strengthen internal unity, to achieve \nreconciliation by returning to the ballot box, to \nwage a peaceful and popular resistance to counter \nthe oppression of occupation and of settlements and \nsettler terrorism, and to hold fast to their rights. The \nPalestinian people do not want to remain \u201cout of place\u201d, \nin the words of Edward Said. Our people are waiting for \nthe day when their cause ceases to be a fixed item on \nthe agenda of the United Nations. Our people want to \nhave freedom, God\u2019s gift to humanity, and to enjoy the \ngrace of living an ordinary life. For we, as Mahmoud \nDarwish wrote, cultivate hope and shall one day be \nwhat we want to be: a free, sovereign people on the land \nof the State of Palestine.\n\nI personally am one of the victims of Al-Nakba, \none of the hundreds of thousands of my people who \nwere uprooted in 1948 from our beautiful world and \nthrown into exile. Like hundreds of thousands of other \nPalestine refugees, I knew as a youth the pain of exile \nand the tragedy of the loss of loved ones in massacres \nand wars, as well as the difficulties of building a new \nlife from zero. In refugee camps and the diaspora, \nin exile, we knew the bitter taste of poverty, hunger, \nillness and humiliation, and the challenge of affirming \none\u2019s identity.\n\nOur people have walked the path of armed revolution \nand have risen from the ashes of Al-Nakba. They have \ncollected their shattered souls and identity to put their \ncause to the world and ensure that the recognition \nof their rights is enshrined. We have walked a long, \ndifficult path and sacrificed dearly, and yet we have \naffirmed at all times our active quest for peace.\n\nTwenty years ago, on behalf of the Palestine \nLiberation Organization, I signed the Declaration \nof Principles Agreement, and we have since worked \nfaithfully and diligently to implement it, affirming to \nall our respect for our commitments and the credibility \nof our positions. The successive setbacks encountered \nhave not shaken our strong faith in the objective of a \njust peace, and we shall continue to work tirelessly \nand unwaveringly to see it realized. My own personal \nhope is to see the day when a just peace reigns so that \nthe generation of Al-Nakba can pass on to its children \nand grandchildren the flag of an independent State of \nPalestine.\n\nTime is running out; the window of hope is \nnarrowing and opportunities are diminishing. The \ncurrent round of negotiations appears to be a last \nchance to realize a just peace. The mere thought of the \ncatastrophic and frightening consequences of failure \nmust compel the international community to intensify \nefforts to seize this opportunity.\n\nThe hour of freedom for the Palestinian people has \nrung. The hour of the independence of Palestine has \nrung. The hour of peace for the two peoples \u2014 Israeli \nand Palestinian \u2014 has rung.\n"

        "file_text": "I \nam pleased to congratulate you, Sir, on your election \nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\neighth session, and to welcome the fact that this lofty \nresponsibility has been entrusted to a dear friend from \nAntigua and Barbuda, a member of our community of \nLatin American and Caribbean States. You can count \non the firm support of Peru in the execution of your \nwork.\n\nAt the outset, I wish to express our respect for and \nsolidarity with the people of Mexico and Pakistan, \nwho are suffering as a result of natural disasters. I also \nwish to express the strong rejection and condemnation \nof the Government and people of Peru of the terrorist \nattack in Nairobi. We are relieved that this horrendous \nattack has come to an end. We express our unwavering \nsolidarity with the families of the victims and with the \nGovernment and people of Kenya at this difficult time.\n\nThe world is changing, the agenda is realigning, \nnew actors are emerging and new horizons are coming \ninto view for the future of humankind. All countries \nand peoples are affected by such rapid transformation. \nHowever, we note with concern that some fundamental \ntruths have not changed. Wars continue, mostly in new \nforms, emerging from the shadows and exacting an \never higher price from innocent populations.\n\nRegarding the Syrian tragedy, we express our \nsolidarity with the Syrian people. Peru condemns \nthe use of chemical weapons as unacceptable in all \ncircumstances. It is an affront to humankind and a clear \nviolation of international law. The Syrian people deserve \nan immediate solution to the bloody conflict ravaging \ntheir country. We therefore urge all parties involved to \nfind a peaceful and negotiated solution that respects the \nmechanisms for the settlement of disputes. We also call \non the Security Council to uphold its responsibility to \nmaintain international peace and security.\n\nAt the same time, inequality is becoming ever \nmore extreme. The gap marginalizing the poor from \nthe benefits of progress and development widens by the \nday, robbing them of the rights enshrined in the Charter \nof the United Nations.\n\nIt is crucial for us to strengthen, renew and \nuphold our global commitment to developing peaceful \nrelations among peoples and to seeking solutions \nthat reject the use of force as means of solving our \nproblems. It is therefore particularly gratifying for Peru \nand a source of genuine pride that we addressed our \nmaritime delimitation dispute with Chile in the most \nconstructive and cooperative way possible, through a \nmutual commitment to abiding by and enforcing the \njudgment to be rendered by the International Court of \nJustice. This process will, I trust, transform the very \nnature of our relationship into a profitable and enduring \ncoexistence for the future of our neighbouring peoples.\n\nThe rule of law and its principles in the conduct of \ninternational affairs are therefore indispensable tools \nfor our conduct as members of the community of peoples \nof the United Nations. However, the greatest threat to \ninternational peace and security falls not in the realm \nof relations between States, but transcends them and \nmay even use them as tools for shadowy schemes. We \nare referring to terrorism, drug trafficking, organized \ncrime, mafias and corruption. All of these crimes pose \na genuine threat to life, progress and development, \naffecting primarily the poorest, which means that such \ncrimes are increasingly becoming the main obstacle to \nthe realization of the goals of the United Nations. \n\nThe underlying problems remain the same. Peru \ntherefore welcomes the fundamentally important \ntheme you have chosen, Sir, for our discussions \u2014 the \ndevelopment agenda for beyond 2015, which is the \ndeadline for achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs). \n\nOur country, happily, has made progress and \nattained some of the best benchmarks for achievement. \nSince 2000, according to United Nations Development \nProgramme indicators, we achieved certain goals early, \nin particular in the fight against poverty and extreme \npoverty, hunger, child mortality, and access to safe \ndrinking water. In 2000, more than half of Peruvians \nlived in poverty; today, only a quarter of my countrymen \nstill face that situation. Our goal is to reduce those \nliving in poverty to one fifth of our population by the \nend of my term, in 2016.\n\nWe have undertaken to realign the growth \nmodel by focusing on inclusion. In those efforts, the \nState is implementing a number of connected and \ninterdependent policies. It is worth underscoring the \nunprecedented measure of devoting expenditure to the \npoorest and most excluded through a range of social \nprogrammes aimed at improving the living standards \nof the population, enhancing education for children \nand young people and promoting gender equality and \naccess to health services, paying particular attention to \nthose in vulnerable situations.\n\n\n\f\nWe are deeply concerned to note that the \nenvironment is deteriorating, which is having an impact \non our security, in particular that of the most vulnerable. \nThis is happening even as we remain unable to agree on \nmeasures to ensure our sustainable development. \n\nThe development agenda must also pay particular \nattention to the empowerment of women and the \nprotection of vulnerable groups. Our Government \nattaches particular importance to the rights of \nindigenous peoples. We were the first in the world to \nlegislate and regulate the right to prior consultation on \nmeasures directly affecting such groups in accordance \nwith Convention No. 169 of the International Labour \nOrganization.\n\nWe are equally concerned about the rights of migrants \nand the opportunities for integrated development, to \nwhich they contribute, fostering inter-cultural dialogue \nand economic exchanges between their countries of \norigin and their host countries. In that vein, we have \npromoted the free movement of people and welcome the \ninitiative of the Government of Spain to promote visa-\nfree entry for Peruvian nationals into the Schengen \nArea .\n\nWe therefore welcome the commitments contained \nin the document \u201cThe future we want\u201d, adopted at the \nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \nheld last year (resolution 66/288, annex). The process \nproposed at that event to establish sustainable \ndevelopment goals should converge with the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda, leading to the greater capacity \nof the Organization to contribute to solving urgent \nproblems and dealing with development challenges. \n\nWe urgently need to integrate the various separate \nefforts. The United Nations should have a single, \ncomprehensive development agenda. But to do so, we \nneed to change the equation and place the fight for \nequality and against inequality at the centre of our \nefforts. Let us not make growth an end in itself; rather, \nwe should turn it into a tool. That is why in Peru we \nbelieve that the right formula is \u201cinclusion for growth.\u201d \nThat is the direction Peru proposes for the post-2015 \nagenda.\n\nPeru has made a quantum leap in its economy. We \nare currently among the fastest-growing countries. \nResponsible management of our economy has helped to \ncreate 800,000 new jobs so far during my Administration \nand has also helped to reduce unemployment by \n7 per cent. We are gradually diversifying our economy. \nNon-traditional exports account for one third of \nour total exports \u2014 more than $11 billion dollars \ntoday \u2014 and service exports account for $5 billion. We \nare developing our immense potential for tourism.\n\nThe economic growth in recent years has been \nextraordinary, and I must say it has been the result of \nmuch effort, rigour and work, as well as democratic \ncontinuity and perseverance. Peru has managed both \nto avoid the worst effects of global instability and to \nattract levels of investment flows that are unparalleled \nin our country\u2019s history. Our task is to strengthen \nthe foundations that have enabled such growth, in \nparticular by strengthening democracy, institutions, \nthe rule of law and security, building citizenship and \nopening spaces for participation.\n\nWe have the means to do that, since we are a \ncountry of entrepreneurs: 98 per cent of our businesses \nare small or medium-sized. They employ 75 per cent \nof the economically active population and contribute \n42 per cent of the gross domestic product. Thanks \nto our efforts, Peru is now considered an emerging, \nmiddle-income country, with new middle classes and a \ngrowing domestic consumption, and it is able to attract \nlong-term investments for large projects.\n\nThanks to that and to the extent that we have \nstrengthened our national capacities, we will be \nable to encourage industrial policies geared towards \nchanging economic and social structures. For us, \nindustrialization is a national goal. In order to move in \nthat direction, in December Lima will host the fifteenth \nGeneral Conference of the United Nations Industrial \nDevelopment Organization.\n\nBeing centrally located on the map of South America \nand having played a key role in Latin American history, \nPeru views its region from the perspective of a country \nthat seeks consensus, both internal and external. Peru \nis a country that perceives regional integration as an \neffective way to improve the present and future of \nour security and development. We Peruvians have an \noverriding conviction that, on our own, we can move \nforward rapidly, but together we can do that better and \nreach farther.\n\nPeru is part of the Pacific Alliance, along with \nMexico, Chile and Colombia. Together we are moving \ntowards integration with a strategic projection towards \nthe Asia-Pacific region and the world. In that region, \nwhich is home to the most dynamic economies of the \ntwenty-first century, we are also part of the Asia-\n\n\n\f\nPacific Economic Cooperation Forum. We hosted the \nLeaders\u2019 Meeting in 2008 and will host it again in 2016.\n\nWe are also a member of the Union of South \nAmerican Nations, having recently completed our \nterm as pro-tempore president. We participate in the \nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States, \nwhich this year held its first summit with the Heads \nof State and Government of the European Union. \nWe maintain our hemispheric roots through the \nOrganization of American States, and at the subregional \nlevel, we are currently the pro-tempore president of the \nAndean Community. We consider all those forums to be \ncomplementary. We participate in them with a constant \ncall for integration, dialogue and consensus.\n\nPeru is a reliable partner committed to global \ncauses. Our commitment to the values and principles \nof the General Assembly brings us to point out the \nneed for reform. That is necessary in order to make the \nUnited Nations system more legitimate, representative, \naccountable and effective through the strengthening of \nits principal organs, specialized agencies and various \norganizations in the areas of security, development \nand human rights. Peru shares the position held by a \nlarge number of Member States on the need to reform \nand expand the Security Council so as to reflect the \nrealities of the twenty-first century.\n\nOur aspirations also entail more transparency \nand accountability on the part of individual economic \nactors and greater justice in the distribution of wealth. \nWith those objectives in mind, in 2014 Peru will host \nthe thirty-fifth session of the Economic Commission \nfor Latin America and the Caribbean and in 2016 the \nfourteenth United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment. We thereby hope to contribute so that the \nDoha Round can be resumed, in the scope of the World \nTrade Organization, with better prospects.\n\nIn many parts of our Latin America and in Peru, \nrepublican States were weak from the start, concentrated \nin the capital city. Their core problem has been therefore \nthat they have been unable to deal with the entire nation \nand have focused perhaps on one third of the country. \nIt was impossible to build citizenship, since in practice \nthere were different categories of Peruvians: those who \nreceived Government services and those who did not.\n\nOur efforts must be directed at the creation of a \ntwenty-first-century State, a State that serves all, \nnot just a few. While this includes an eminently \nethical component, its basis is not restricted to that \nimportant dimension. It also has profoundly practical \nrepercussions for society at large. We cannot forget that \na State that does not serve the entire population breeds \nand exacerbates inequality. As long as such degrees of \ninequality exist \u2013 and I will never tire of saying this - \nany policy aimed at combating poverty will have only \nrelative effects.\n\nFor that reason, my Administration has worked not \nonly on economic growth but in all areas of growth. The \nhistory of my country has seen other periods of growth, \nbut they proved to be unsustainable and benefited very \nfew. Economic growth is a means and not an end; it \nis an indispensable tool, but it is not sufficient. Our \npeople, especially those who are most forgotten, cannot \nwait indefinitely for growth without the State actively \npromoting the extension of its benefits.\n\nIn addition, that will set in motion a virtuous circle \nin which progress for our most vulnerable countrymen \nand the development of a population free of extreme \npoverty, with health care and education for all, will \ncreate the conditions for even greater economic growth. \nThat is why we stress the new political concept of \nsimultaneous growth and redistribution. That is what \nI mean when I stress the necessity of \u201cincluding so as \nto grow\u201d.\n\nTwo years ago, less than two months into my term \nas President of Peru, I stood before the Assembly to \nemphasize my Government\u2019s commitment to social \ninclusion. I said then that we were working to turn \nour economic growth into development and quality of \nlife for my countrymen. I also said that we intended to \nhone our democracy so that it could solve the problems \nand meet the needs of all. The country we want is a \nprosperous one where all the Peruvians, women and \nmen, without any distinction, can enjoy the benefits of \ngrowth in a dignified, safe and free manner. After two \nyears in office, I reaffirm what I said; our commitment \nremains the same.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour and \npleasure to participate in the sixty-eighth session of \nthe General Assembly on behalf of the people and \nthe Government of Tuvalu. At the outset, I would like \nto congratulate the President on his new leadership \nresponsibilities; he has all the blessings and support \nof Tuvalu. I also wish to thank and acknowledge with \nprofound appreciation the outgoing President and the \ncontinued assistance and support given by Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, the specialized organizations \nand their respective heads and staff. We are particularly \ngrateful for our membership in the United Nations \nfollowing a successful sixty-seventh session.\n\nThe new Government of Tuvalu, of which I am \nhonoured to be Deputy Prime Minister, was elected \ntwo months ago. Just last week, the Government, in \ncooperation with development partners, launched a \nroad map committing to mutual partnerships that will \ndeliver and make a difference for the people of Tuvalu. \nThe road map focuses on improving the delivery of vital \nbasic services, strengthening good governance and \nenhancing local capacity to address Tuvalu\u2019s unique \nvulnerabilities and respond effectively to the impacts \nof climate change.\n\nIt is visionary and timely to focus our debate on the \ntheme of \u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: setting \nthe stage\u201d as we approach the end of a journey called \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We are \nnow ready to chart a new path, which we are calling \nthe sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the post-\n2015 agenda. And as we do every fall, we have gathered \nto reaffirm our spirit for and commitment to a renewed \nmultilateralism and genuine collective action and to \nreflect, assess, address and plan for how to realize the \nCharter\u2019s principles of peace, justice, human rights, \nsocial progress and equal opportunity for all.\n\nHowever, our global efforts cannot be fully universal \nuntil the United Nations pragmatically recognizes the \ninternational contribution that the Republic of China on \nTaiwan has made and the responsibility it has undertaken \nto achieve the noble goals of the United Nations, as well \nas the MDGs and SDGs, thus improving the standards \nof living of millions all over the world. The Republic \n\n\n\f\nof China\u2019s significant international participation in \nUnited Nations specialized agencies, including in \nthe World Health Organization, UNESCO, UNICEF, \nthe International Civil Aviation Organization, the \nInternational Maritime Organization and the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \nis critical as we collectively advance towards the \npost-MDG era and enter the era of the sustainable \ndevelopment goals. \n\nTuvalu also fully supports the lifting of the embargo \nagainst Cuba. That will allow the Republic of Cuba to \nfurther consolidate and enhance its cooperation with \nsmall island developing States (SIDS) like Tuvalu.\n\nLooking back at our MDG journey, we have come \nacross a myriad of crises and challenges, both natural \nand man-made. We know where we have come from, \nwe know our capacities and constraints in facing those \ncrises and challenges, and we know the direction we are \nheading in. We give great attention to how to address \nthe many persistent and ongoing issues in their entirety \nand in their many forms, as we approach the finish line \nfor the MDGs.\n\nAs we make the transition to the SDG stage and the \npost-2015 agenda, we take heed of the intrinsic lessons \nfrom the MDGs. First, the United Nations continues to \nbe a beacon of hope and, through strategic advocacy \nand awareness campaigns, the Organization brings the \nreal issues and current events into the consciousness \nof both the public and the membership in order to \npropel action and redress. Secondly, partnership is \nkey to the success of this truly universal Organization. \nWorking together cooperatively delivers much more \nthat we can make happen on our own. Cooperation \nand collaboration with communities, businesses, think \ntanks, churches, philanthropists, regional groupings \nand not least each United Nations Member, reaffirms \na true and sustainable union that should constitute the \nway forward for the SDGs.\n\nThe United Nations Charter should be mirrored in \nour national goals and priorities. Our vision for the new \nSDGs and post-2015 agenda must reflect a membership \nthat is striving for the same goals \u2014 a world that \nembodies peace, not conflicts and terrorism; hope, \nnot despair; opportunities, jobs and prospects for a \ndecent life, not unemployment and welfare dependence; \nsecurity and freedom, not insecurity and totalitarianism; \nequality, not autocracy; unity, not divisiveness; good \ngovernance and leadership, not tyranny; sufficiency, \nnot poverty; progress, not setbacks and regression; and \nempowerment, not constraint.\n\nLet me reflect on Tuvalu\u2019s performance with \nrespect to the MDGs as the deadline 2015 draws near. \nI am pleased to report that Tuvalu has made significant \nprogress towards the achievement of its MDGs, despite \nthe impact of the various global financial and economic \ncrises on its small, vulnerable economy. In the 2012 \nMDG progress report, Tuvalu was assessed as being \non track with respect to four of the MDGs: primary \neducation, child mortality, maternal health and global \npartnership; as having the potential to achieve three \nMDG targets: gender equality, combating HIV/AIDS, \nand environmental sustainability; and as being unlikely \nto achieve the MDG on poverty.\n\nThe attainment of the MDG on poverty is a \nformidable challenge for the fourth-smallest country in \nthe world. Tuvalu is poorly endowed in terms of natural \nresources and has almost no productive capacity. Tuvalu \nis highly dependent on aid, leasing gratuities and rental \nincomes derived from its national assets \u2014 air, sea \nand its domain \u2014 and remittances. We will continue \nto seek the invaluable support and cooperation of the \nUnited Nations and the donor community in our pursuit \nof attaining the MDG on poverty as we approach 2015.\n\nGender equality and the empowerment of women \nand youth is pursued at all levels of decision-making. In \n2012, Tuvalu adopted a family protection bill that aims \nat safeguarding our women and girls against sexual and \ngender-based violence, domestic violence and rape. The \nbill has facilitated access to justice and improved the \nprovision of services to women and girls who have been \nsubject to discrimination and violence, whether in the \npublic or the private sphere.\n\nTuvalu is also fully committed to the strategic \nimplementation of the outcomes of the Barbados \nProgramme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy \nfor the Further Implementation of the Programme of \nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small Island \nDeveloping States. As we approach the International \nYear of Small Island Developing States, in 2014, and \nthe third International Conference on Small Island \nDeveloping States in Apia, Samoa, we urge the United \nNations to ensure that SIDS status and SIDS-specific \nrecognition are truly sanctioned in the Organization\u2019s \nbureaucracy. We have seen enough General Assembly \nresolutions that address SIDS issues in a vague \nand abstract way, and yet the entire United Nations \n\n\n\f\ndevelopment agenda includes no specific treatment of \nSIDS. The 2014 SIDS Conference must be decisive on \nestablishing special windows for partnerships on SIDS \nthat are designed to ensure not only their sustainable \ndevelopment but also their long-term security and \nsurvival.\n\nTuvalu appreciates the decision of the Economic \nand Social Council to defer consideration of Tuvalu\u2019s \ngraduation from the least developed country (LDC) \ncategory under the Istanbul Programme of Action for \nthe Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2011-\n2020. That said, however, Tuvalu humbly submits that \nwhile the threshold criteria of LDC graduation \u2014 the \nhuman development index, per capita gross national \nincome and the economic vulnerability index \u2014 are \nwell established, it would simply be irrational and \nirresponsible if application of any two of the three \ncriteria was the only measure of consideration for \ngraduation. Given Tuvalu\u2019s extreme vulnerability \nas a SIDS, we believe that our failure to achieve a \nsatisfactory EVI level carries more weight for us in \nconsidering our possible graduation from the LDC list.\n\nClimate change and sea-level rise have had dire \nconsequences for Tuvalu\u2019s situation. Our survival and \nsecurity, and our children\u2019s future livelihood, have \nbeen seriously compromised by the international \ncommunity\u2019s inaction on climate change. The fifth \nassessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change, Climate Change 2013: The Physical \nScience Basis, has further confirmed to the world the \nstark predictions for SIDS like Tuvalu in the wake of \nclimate change and sea-level rise. The challenge we \nput to the Assembly is, What else are we waiting for? \nWhat is the relevance of talking about post-MDGs \nand SDGs when the world continues to fail in its duty \nand obligations to urgently reduce greenhouse-gas \nemissions and provide genuine adaptation? Ensuring \nTuvalu\u2019s long-term security means saving the whole \nworld.\n\nClimate change is no longer an environmental \nor political issue. It is a borderless security issue for \nhumankind. Everyone must act to urgently reduce \ngreenhouse-gas emissions and provide adaptation. \nAmong the papers distributed to the Assembly is the \n2013 Pacific Islands Forum Communiqu\u00e9, which \ncontains the Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership, \nwhich Tuvalu strongly supports. Through the Majuro \nDeclaration, the Pacific island leaders commit their \nfull responsibility and leadership to making their own \ncontribution, however minuscule, to global efforts to \ncut greenhouse-gas emissions. If we SIDS in the Pacific \ncan do it, surely others can, too. \n\nThe world must save Tuvalu and the SIDS in \norder to save the whole planet. We urge perseverance, \nwith the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change and the Kyoto Protocol as the primary \ninternational and intergovernmental instruments for \nnegotiating the global response to climate change. \nWe call on all parties to work diligently to reach a \nlegally binding framework for curbing greenhouse-gas \nemissions at the upcoming nineteenth session of the \nUnited Nations Climate Change Conference, in Warsaw. \nThe framework should also include mechanisms \ndealing with climate-change-related loss, damages \nand insurance for SIDS, and should provide adequate \nand accessible financing for adaptation support to \nSIDS such as Tuvalu. Tuvalu also applauds and fully \nsupports the leadership of the Secretary-General and \nhis commitment to hosting a climate change summit \nnext year.\n\nFor Tuvalu, the climate change issue is \npredominantly linked to the oceans. For a nation \nsurrounded by seas, an ocean SDG is pertinent, for \nobvious reasons. Seventy per cent of the planet\u2019s \nsurface is covered by oceans, which are the cornerstone \nof Earth\u2019s life support system. The uncontrolled and \nincreasing carbonization of our oceans and their \nbiodiversity are genuine issues of concern and must \nbe urgently addressed. At the same time, radioactive \nspillovers of land-based nuclear wastes into the oceans, \nespecially those that have followed recent incidents, \nmust be dealt with properly and prevented from \nhappening again. Here, the principle that the polluter \npays should be the basis for efforts to clean, mitigate \nand prevent contamination of the oceans.\n\nTuvalu is currently heavily dependent on \nimported fuel and petroleum products for electricity \ngeneration and transportation requirements. That will \ncontinue in both the short and medium term. Many \nrecommendations for alternative energy sources and \ntechnologies, whether solar, wind or wave, have been \nproposed but not fully implemented. Our energy sector \nhas set itself the challenge of becoming 100 per cent \nrenewable by 2020. We appreciate the support of the \nmany donors we have had for alternative renewable \nsources of energy, assistance with formulating energy \npolicy and promoting efficient energy sources. Science \nand technological capacity in Tuvalu also remain \n\n\n\f\nunderdeveloped, and we need relevant and simple \ntechnologies that can be made readily available and \npriced effectively, especially for LDCs and SIDS. The \nfacilitative role of the United Nations as a repository \nof such technologies and practices within the \nOrganization\u2019s networks and websites will prove highly \nbeneficial.\n\nFinally, as we approach the end of the MDGs \nand embrace the SDGs, we must pay attention to \nthe nations with special needs, the poorest and most \nvulnerable, in making every effort to meet the MDGs \nand achieve a smooth transition to the SDGs. The scale \nof the challenges can be addressed only by reforming \nourselves \u2014 the United Nations and each Member \ncountry. Delivering on the future we need and on \nour sustainable goals, delivering more and delivering \nbetter, will require increasing doses of great effort \nand discipline, perseverance and courage, tolerance \nand harmonious coexistence, multilateralism and \ninterdependence on the part of us, the peoples of the \nUnited Nations.\n\nIn a couple of days, Tuvalu will celebrate its thirty-\nfifth year of independence. Can we tell our children \nand grandchildren a story of continued survival on \nour God-given peaceful islands? Or do we have to tell \nthem that the world, under the United Nations, that \nnoble body, can no longer save their future because of \nclimate change and sea-level rise? As with great pride \nwe celebrate the continuing vibrancy of democracy \nand the rule of law, and our political independence in \nTuvalu, we also appeal to the world. Please save Tuvalu \nfrom climate change. Let the world save Tuvalu in order \nto save itself.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of the \nRepublic of Kazakhstan, I should like first to \ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. John Ashe on his \nelection as the President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-eighth session and to wish him every success in \nhis important functions. I should also like to take this \nopportunity to express our profound gratitude to His \nExcellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi., President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session, for his able \nstewardship, energy and dedication in finding solutions \nto critical international challenges.\n\nSince we met here at the United Nations a year \nago the world situation has not improved but, on the \ncontrary, has deteriorated, becoming more fragile and \nvulnerable to new risks and threats. A growing number \nof States in the Middle East and Africa, which were \nmaking steady progress, both economically and socially, \nare now witnessing regression. Some Asian States are \nfacing similar risks of destabilization. The number of \npost-conflict countries is also on the rise, inevitably \naffecting global development in an interconnected \nworld. Never before has the need been more compelling \nfor equal partnership and the participation of all \nMember States, based on mutual respect and norms as \nembodied in the principles of the Charter of the United \nNations and international law. The United Nations, by \nthe power invested in it by its Member States, stands out \nas our unquestioned leading entity on the world stage.\n\nKazakhstan strongly condemns the use of chemical \nweapons in Syria, as confirmed by the findings of \nan independent investigation by the United Nations \nmission, and regards it as a crime against humanity. We \nsupport the adoption of a Security Council resolution \non Syria that would stipulate strict compliance with \na concerted decision on the elimination of chemical \nweapons in that country and the conduct of regular \ninspections of that process.\n\nWe express our hope that the accession of Syria to \nthe Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, \nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons \nand on Their Destruction, as well as the placement of \nsuch weapons under international control, will preclude \nthe possibility of their repeated use and will contribute \ntowards the end of the long-standing and bloody conflict \nin Syria. We call for the earliest possible convening \nof an international conference on the settlement of \nthat conflict, with the aim of ending the violence and \ndetermining Syria\u2019s political future through dialogue \nand reconciliation.\n\nThe current situation in the nuclear disarmament \nprocess also does not encourage confidence in a more \npeaceful future. While we participated actively in \nyesterday\u2019s High-level Meeting, we stress once again \nnow from the rostrum of the General Assembly that our \ncountry has a special moral authority to champion the \ncause of nuclear abolition. By closing the Semipalatinsk \nnuclear test site soon after our independence in 1991 \nand renouncing the fourth-largest nuclear arsenal, \nKazakhstan made a unique contribution in the \nmultilateral effort to achieve a world free of nuclear \nweapons.\n\nWe believe that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which remains the \ncornerstone of the non-proliferation regime, must reach \nfull universalization, with the strict implementation \nof national obligations in accordance with the three \n\n\n\f\nfundamental pillars of the Treaty \u2014 non-proliferation, \nthe peaceful use of nuclear energy and \ndisarmament \u2014 in a balanced way. We call on all \nnon-NPT countries possessing nuclear weapons to sign \nthe Treaty and on all States parties not to withdraw. \nThe entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-\nTest-Ban Treaty (CTBT) should become an important \ncatalyst in the non-proliferation process, promoting the \neffective implementation of the NPT. We urge those \ncountries that have not yet done so to sign and ratify that \nimportant document. The General Assembly resolution \ninitiated by Kazakhstan establishing 29 August as the \nInternational Day against Nuclear Tests (resolution \n64/35) matches the goals and objectives for the entry \ninto force of the CTBT.\n\nThe Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in \nCentral Asia, which came into force in March 2009, \nrepresents an important contribution by the Central \nAsian countries to international and regional security. \nIt is the first nuclear-weapon-free zone established in \nthe northern hemisphere and shares common borders \nwith two major nuclear Powers. It is also the first such \nzone where previously nuclear weapons had existed. \nKazakhstan welcomes the willingness of the five \npermanent members of the Security Council to hold \na dialogue on the Additional Protocol with the five \ncountries in the zone and to provide negative assurances \nas soon as possible.\n\nKazakhstan supports the early convening of the \nconference on the establishment of a Middle East zone \nfree of weapons of mass destruction under the auspices \nof the United Nations and calls upon all States in the \nregion actively to cooperate to make that important \nundertaking possible.\n\nIn order to take further decisive actions to eliminate \nthe nuclear threat, President Nursultan Nazarbaev of \nthe Republic of Kazakhstan has proposed the adoption \nof a universal declaration for a nuclear-weapon-free \nworld, which would be an important step towards a \nnuclear-weapons prohibition convention, and thereby \nachieving a nuclear-weapon-free world. We count on \nMember States to finalize and submit a draft resolution \non the universal declaration of the General Assembly at \nthis session.\n\nWe support an immediate political and diplomatic \nsettlement of the situation concerning the Iranian \nnuclear programme on the basis of strict compliance \nwith the provisions of the NPT and the International \nAtomic Energy Agency regulations. In order to \nensure progress in the dialogue between the group \nof international mediators and Iran, Kazakhstan \nhosted two rounds of negotiations in Almaty this \nyear. Specific agreements have yet to be reached, but \nwe are confident that a mutually acceptable outcome \nis possible. We believe that concrete actions by Iran \nto ensure the transparency and peaceful nature of its \nnuclear programme, along with reciprocal constructive \nsteps on the part of the group of six, will advance \nthe settlement of the problem, rather than relying on \nsanctions alone. We all witnessed the latest positive \nsigns of understanding on that issue during the current \nsession and wholeheartedly welcomed them, remaining \nfully available to contribute to a productive negotiation \nprocess.\n\nWe express our grave concern about North Korea\u2019s \nnuclear programme. Attempts to engage in the secret \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons in violation of \ninternational obligations cannot be justified under \nany circumstances. At the same time, Kazakhstan is \nagainst a military solution to the problem, since we \nare convinced that only the peaceful settlement of that \ncrisis, within the framework of the Six-Party Talks, can \nensure peace and stability in North-East Asia. \n\nKazakhstan is genuinely interested in the \nsustainable and stable development of Afghanistan \nthrough its transformation into a politically stable and \neconomically viable State in keeping with the decisions \nof the ministerial conference of the Istanbul Process held \nin Almaty last April. We support the rapid integration \nof Afghanistan into the regional framework so as to \npromote its speedy social and economic recovery.\n\nThe Asian continent is transforming itself into a \nglobal powerhouse for the twenty-first century, with \nits production of more than 57 per cent of global \ngross domestic product \u2014 a trend that is expected to \nincrease. However, that growth could be jeopardized by \nan aggravation of existing conflicts, illegal migration, \ndrug trafficking, territorial claims, separatism, \nreligious extremism and terrorism. To cope with those \nchallenges, Asia needs a regional security architecture. \nKazakhstan, as the host of the Conference on Interaction \nand Confidence-building Measures in Asia, is striving \nto maximize opportunities for joint decision-making on \nsecurity and cooperation in Asia.\n\nKazakhstan is committed to the fundamental \nprinciples of international law, among which respect \nfor human rights and freedom, based on impartiality \nand non-politicization, is deemed pivotal for a \n\n\n\f\nsustainable, universal and effective global architecture \nfor protecting human rights. That, among other things, \nrequires appropriate budgeting and the strengthening of \nthe Human Rights Council and its special procedures, \nin particular the universal periodic review and the \ninstitution of special rapporteurs, as well as supporting \nthe capacity and authority of United Nations human \nrights mechanisms.\n\nWe need to implement civil, political, economic, \nsocial and cultural rights at the national, regional \nand global levels while paying particular attention \nto vulnerable groups. Kazakhstan, as a multiethnic \nand multi-confessional country, can facilitate a \ncomprehensive dialogue among civilizations within the \nUnited Nations and various international and regional \norganizations. The Congress of Leaders of World and \nTraditional Religions, which Kazakhstan convenes \nevery three years, contributes to global and regional \nsecurity by mobilizing the spiritual and moral potential \nof world religions to mitigate international conflicts \nso as to prevent confrontations between faiths and \ncultures.\n\nAdditionally, at the initiative of Kazakhstan, the \nGeneral Assembly proclaimed the period between \n2013 and 2022 as the International Decade for the \nRapprochement of Cultures. Its official inauguration \nwas held in Astana last month, thereby paving the way \nfor cultural diversity and tolerance. Kazakhstan calls \non Member States actively to participate in the events \nof the Decade and to support synergy between the \nAlliance of Civilizations and the Congress of Leaders \nof World and Traditional Religions.\n\nThe consequences of the global financial and \neconomic crisis have led to the conclusion that the \nworld needs a common policy of global governance. \nKazakhstan therefore welcomes the adoption of the \nresolution on the United Nations in global economic \ngovernance (resolution 67/289), which recognizes the \nvalue of cooperation and interaction between the United \nNations and various regional and subregional groups.\n\nOver the years, Kazakhstan has hosted the Astana \nEconomic Forum, which is now a reputed international \nplatform that covers the most pressing and ever-\nexpanding issues of the world economy. The first \nWorld Anti-Crisis Conference was held as part of the \nForum last May in Astana. The Astana Declaration, the \nrecommendations of the Astana Economic Forum to \nthe Group of 20 leaders and the road map of the World \nAnti-Crisis Plan were adopted as outcome documents. \nThe second World Anti-Crisis Conference, which is to \nbe held next May in Kazakhstan, will draft the world \nanti-crisis plan to combat the financial and economic \ncrisis so as to ensure long-term sustainable economic \ngrowth.\n\nWe are pleased to note the commendable work of \nthe United Nations in implementing the agreements \nreached at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment held in Rio de Janeiro (Rio+20), and \nKazakhstan is actively contributing to that work. A \nnational plan for transitioning to a green economy has \nbeen developed, with programmes in key sectors of \nthe economy \u2014 energy, water, utilities, agriculture, \nindustry and biodiversity. Kazakhstan has also initiated \nthe transition to a green economy in Central Asia within \nthe framework of the regional Intergovernmental \nCommission on Sustainable Development. The Rio+20 \nConference supported the Kazakhstan-sponsored \nGreen Bridge Partnership Programme as a voluntary \nframework for mutually beneficial cooperation between \nthe developed and developing world in the interests of \nsustainable development. Next Monday, 30 September, \nKazakhstan will host the International Conference on \nthe Green Bridge Partnership Programme in Astana \nwith the participation of regional countries, the \nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the \nPacific, the Economic Commission for Europe and \nother stakeholders. At that Conference the programme \nwill be institutionalized and its secretariat established.\n\nKazakhstan has made voluntary commitments to \nreduce greenhouse-gas emissions within the framework \nof the United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change by reducing carbon dioxide emissions \nand investing in low-carbon development, all of which \nconstitute Kazakhstan\u2019s contribution to the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s global Sustainable Energy for All initiative \nand other initiatives aimed at sustainable development.\n\nI am pleased to inform members that Kazakhstan\u2019s \ncapital, Astana, will host the international exhibition \nEXPO 2017, entitled \u201cEnergy for the Future\u201d, which \nis designed to disseminate best practices in the \nfield of sustainable energy. On the basis of national \nconsultations, we have developed a number of \nrecommendations on development goals for the post-\n2015 agenda and submitted them to the United Nations. \nWe believe that those Millennium Development Goals \nthat were not reached must be included in the post-\n2015 agenda, in conjunction with the objectives of \nsustainable development. International partnerships \n\n\n\f\nmust be strengthened for South-South and triangular \ncooperation so as to complement official development \nassistance activities. Strengthening resilience in order \nto withstand external factors such as climate change \nand the financial and food crises will have to gain \npriority under the new agenda.\n\nIn that regard, Kazakhstan\u2019s chairmanship of the last \nand symbolic twentieth session of the Commission on \nSustainable Development effected its official transition \nand handover to the High-Level Political Forum on \nSustainable Development. The establishment of the \nHigh-Level Political Forum is historic as a universal \nplatform to meet current realities, closely linked with \nglobal security, which justifies the rationale for a \ndirect nexus between the High-Level Political Forum \nand the Security Council over the issues of food, the \nenvironment, energy and water security.\n\nFor the first time since its independence, \nKazakhstan has announced its candidature for a \nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \nperiod 2017 to 2018, based on the principles of fair \nand equitable geographical rotation and the adequate \nrepresentation of all States members of the Asia-Pacific \nregional group. The experience we have gained from \nrecently chairing a number of regional and international \norganizations and forums, such as the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, the Organization \nof Islamic Cooperation, the Conference on Interaction \nand Confidence-building Measures in Asia, the \nCommonwealth of Independent States, the Shanghai \nCooperation Organization, the Collective Security \nTreaty Organization and others, gives us unique \naccess to a wide and diverse range of experiences and \napproaches to solving international security problems \naddressed by the Security Council.\n\nIf elected, Kazakhstan will unfailingly be united \nwith others to contribute to the maintenance of \ninternational peace and security and will support \nefforts to reform the Council, transforming it into a \nmore representative and transparent body that can \neffectively address the full range of challenges and \nthreats facing the world today. We therefore count on \nthe broad support of Member States for our candidacy \nto the Security Council for the period 2017 to 2018.\n\nLast year, Kazakhstan celebrated the twentieth \nanniversary of its accession to the United Nations, \nand this year the twentieth anniversary of a United \nNations presence in our country. Our Government \nand people strongly support the United Nations in all \nits programmes. Kazakhstan acts as a geographical \nand political bridge between North and South, Europe \nand Asia. For that reason, it is ideally suited to foster \ncooperative initiatives in that vast regional landscape. \nPromoting Kazakhstan to the status of a middle-income \ncountry represents both challenges and opportunities for \nthe development agenda, shifting the focus from being \na recipient country to that of a regional development \npartner.\n\nRegional cooperation is critical to ensuring national \nand regional security. Persistent conflict and instability \nin Afghanistan also have an effect on Central Asia. \nPoverty, unemployment and growing disparities in \neconomic and social development in the countries of \nCentral Asia are strong factors indicating the potential \nfor new mass population movements, instability, \nenvironmental degradation, drug trafficking, religious \nextremism and terrorism, all of which must be addressed \nthrough regional cooperation. Such collaboration can \nbe facilitated through the establishment of a United \nNations multi-country centre in Kazakhstan in the city \nof Almaty as a hub for promoting regional development, \nsecurity and stability. Kazakhstan is ready to bear \nall the costs for the construction, equipping and \nmaintenance of such a United Nations office bridging \nthe gap between Vienna and Bangkok.\n\nThe 20 years of Kazakhstan\u2019s membership and \ncooperation with the United Nations have been \ncharacterized by the highest dedication to the ideals and \nprinciples of the world Organization. We will continue \nto play the role of an engaged and responsible Member \nState, ready to take on increased responsibilities and \nconsistently implement them in full.\n"

        "file_text": "We have convened here \nin New York at a time that poses enormous challenges \nto the authority and credibility of the United Nations. \nFirst, we are at a crossroads where we have to decide \nthe future course to attain sustainable development. \nSpeaking for Finland at the Rio de Janeiro Conference \non Sustainable Development (Rio+20), I stressed \nthat, faced with advancing climate change and the \naccelerating loss of biodiversity, we might, at best, \nhave only a few decades in which to reach ecologically, \nsocially and economically sustainable development. \nDecisive action based on a sense of urgency is needed \nto turn the tide globally before it is too late. Either \nwe succeed in that together or we are going to perish \ntogether.\n\nThis week, we have taken stock of progress towards \nthe Millennium Development Goals. They have been a \npowerful tool to direct our action. In the near future, \nwe are expected to agree on a new development agenda, \na new set of goals that, in my view, could be called \nsustainable development goals. A green economy is not \na luxury, but a prerequisite, for poverty reduction and \nsustainability. In short, the new agenda must be even \nbolder and more ambitious than the previous one. Its \nimplementation will require action in all countries.\n\nSecondly, we are facing a failure of the United \nNations to act in its core domain, that is, in maintaining \npeace and security. One hundred and ten thousand \npeople have been killed and 2 million people have \nbeen forced to leave their homes in Syria, where a \ntragic civil war has been going on for more than two \nyears. The United Nations has been unable to act to end \nthat appalling bloodshed. That is another of the major \nchallenges for the credibility of the United Nations. Let \nme elaborate on those challenges. \n\nWith more than a threefold increase in the world\u2019s \npopulation since the founding of the United Nations \nand with unprecedented technological progress and \nthe ever-increasing exploitation of natural resources, \nthe world has changed irrevocably. We must now \narrange our existence with our natural environment \nin a new way. As the Secretary-General has said, \nsustainable development is the pathway to the future. \nEcological sustainability \u2014 respecting the planetary \nboundaries \u2014 is the foundation for all development. \nThe alarming trend in climate change underlines the \nurgent need to heed those limits. We must work together \ntowards a comprehensive climate agreement by 2015. \nThe consequences of climate change are already to be \nseen worldwide. The impacts are predicted to intensify \nin the coming years and decades. For instance, billions of \npeople lack access to safe water sources and sanitation. \nWithout radical reforms, that number is expected to \nrise dramatically. There is also significant potential for \nconflicts over water and other natural resources in the \ncoming years.\n\nConsiderable progress has been made in reducing \nextreme poverty. Millions of people have had a \nchance to lift themselves out of poverty. However, \ninequality still persists, and in many cases is increasing \nboth within countries and between them. In several \ncountries not a single Millennium Development Goal \nwill be attained. More than 1 billion people still live in \nextreme poverty, and they are falling behind. Poverty \ncan be eradicated only within the context of sustainable \ndevelopment. Development must be ecologically, \neconomically and socially sustainable. It must be firmly \nanchored in human rights and the values encapsulated \nin the Millennium Declaration. Peace and security are \na precondition for sustainable development. \n\nThe post-2015 process must also include a \nfinancing strategy for sustainable development. We \nare honoured, together with Nigeria, to be co-chairing \nthe Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on \nSustainable Development Financing, mandated by \nthe Rio+20 Summit. We will work hard to achieve a \nstrategy proposal that is action-oriented and inclusive \nand covers a broad range of different aspects of \ndevelopment financing.\n\nI am convinced that sustainable development \nfinancing must be based on national resource \n\n\n\f\nmobilization and management. Nations should mobilize \ntheir own resources through inclusive economic \naction and through responsible international trade and \ninvestments. Developing national taxation systems \nand tax-revenue collection, as well as addressing \nunregulated capital flight and putting an end to illegal \ntax evasion and tax havens, should be central elements \nin sustainable development financing. Our own national \nexperience shows that taxation is an effective means of \naddressing inequality.\n\nDirect foreign investment can be a driver for \ngrowth and development. Investment should be \nsustainable, accountable and adhere to norms of \ncorporate social responsibility in creating economic \nand social development. The current proliferation of \nbilateral investment agreements, already numbering in \nthe thousands, is not the best way to manage investment \nflows or set the rules they should follow. As part of \nour efforts to promote sustainable and fair financial \ngovernance, Finland supports efforts to create an \ninternational investment regime that is transparent, \nbalanced and equitable.\n\nThe sustainable development goals must be \nuniversal, and they must integrate different dimensions \nof development. Fears that sustainable development \nwould challenge the traditional development agenda \nare unfounded. These agendas are not competing, but \ncomplement each other. We must do our utmost to \nagree on a new way to sustainable development in the \nvery near future. Our planet and its citizens cannot \nwait. We, the States Members of the United Nations, \nare shouldering a great responsibility in that respect. \nWe must be able to deliver as the United Nations.\n\nWe also have more traditional security challenges \nat hand. The conflict in Syria has seriously undermined \nthe authority and credibility of the United Nations. \nThe United Nations has not been able to act in its core \ndomain in maintaining peace and security. Both the \nSyrian Government and the international community \nhave failed to implement their responsibility to protect.\n\nThe situation in Syria started as a peaceful and \njustified call for reforms. The Government\u2019s response \nthen turned it into an increasingly violent conflict and \na breeding ground for terrorist extremism. That has led \nto humanitarian suffering, which has already reached \nhistoric proportions. The use of chemical weapons on \n21 August near Damascus can be a turning point in the \nconflict: the universal condemnation of their use as a \nwar crime for which those responsible must be brought \nto justice through referral to the International Criminal \nCourt. Finland welcomes the agreement reached on \na strongly worded Security Council resolution to \ncollect and destroy chemical weapons in Syria under \ninternational control. There can be no impunity for the \nperpetrators of war crimes and other atrocities. \n\nThe agreement has to be followed through with a \npolitical solution to the conflict. That is the only way \nto stop the violence. That means negotiations. The \ninternational community, the parties to the conflict and \nespecially the Security Council must take responsibility \nfor working towards political negotiations. We continue \nto support the initiative of the United States and Russia \nof proposing the \u201cGeneva II\u201d conference, as well as \nthe mediation by the United Nations and Arab League \nJoint Special Representative, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi. \nAll permanent members of the Security Council must \nshoulder their responsibility.\n\nThe humanitarian suffering of the Syrian people \ncontinues. We all must intensify our work to help \nthe refugees and support the neighbouring countries \nbearing the heaviest burdens. The United Nations \nwill also need to have a strong presence in Syria after \nthe arms have fallen silent. Finland stands ready to \ncontribute to a possible United Nations peacekeeping \noperation to be established in Syria.\n\nThe resumption of direct final status negotiations \nbetween the Palestinians and the Israelis is long-awaited \nand most welcome news. Since the Oslo agreement 20 \nyears ago, it has been clear that the best outcome for all \nthe parties is a two-State solution, which can accomplish \na reign of peace and security for the two peoples. We \nmay still have at hand perhaps the last chance for such \na resolution of the conflict. When I say \u201cperhaps the \nlast chance\u201d, it is not because I think there may be more \nchances later, but rather it is because, at worst, the last \nchance may already have been missed. But it is our duty \nto make the effort to achieve a negotiated two-State \nsolution.\n\nFinland commends Secretary Kerry\u2019s dedication \nand the personal commitment demonstrated by the \nparties. The entire international community must lend \nall its support for the negotiations to succeed. That must \nbe concrete and effective support. The role of regional \npartners is crucial, and I welcome the efforts made by \nthe League of Arab States in reviewing the Arab Peace \nInitiative.\n\n\n\f\nThe situations in both Syria and the Middle East \nand between Israel and the Palestinians have been \nthe subject of important mediation efforts. I call for \nstronger political will and determination to resolve \nthose conflicts. The parties must work harder and the \nSecurity Council, especially its permanent members, \nmust shoulder their responsibility. While those efforts \nhave yet to meet with success, I believe that we also \nhave ample evidence to show that mediation works. \nMeasures under Chapter VI of the Charter of the United \nNations deserve more attention, although sometimes \naction under Chapter VII is also needed. Finland and \nTurkey continue to co-Chair the Group of Friends \nof Mediation and to work to strengthen preventive \ndiplomacy, including mediation in the United Nations.\n\nMediation can succeed only with political will from \nthe parties and the international community. Successful \nmediation also calls for the full and equal participation \nof women at all stages. Women are certainly most often \nthe victims of conflicts, but we should also understand \nthat they are essential participants for any mediation \nefforts to bear long-lasting success.\n\nEfforts to promote peace and security in the Middle \nEast should go in parallel with the pursuit of the long-\ntime goal of the establishment of a zone free of nuclear \nweapons and all other weapons of mass destruction in \nthat region. I encourage all regional parties to continue \nto engage constructively with the facilitator and the \nfour conveners, as well as with one another, to pave \nthe way for a conference on the establishment of such \na zone.\n\nAll our failures and disappointments notwithstanding, \nthere has also been one true success story for the United \nNations this year. I am referring to the Arms Trade Treaty \n(ATT), which was adopted in April after decades of \neffort. It was a success not only for the United Nations \nsystem but for the whole international community \nand the arms control regime. The importance of the \nTreaty has been confirmed by the growing number of \nsignatories after 3 June, when the ATT was opened \nfor signature. We hope and expect that the signing of \nthe ATT by the United States will be followed by the \nsigning of all other permanent members of the Security \nCouncil as well. I should also like to congratulate those \ncountries that have already ratified the Treaty, thereby \npaving the way for its early entry into force. My own \ncountry, Finland, is well on its way to ratifying the ATT \nas soon as possible.\n\nOnly when the Treaty enters into force and is \nimplemented will it make a real difference in saving \nlives, minimizing human suffering and lessening \ncriminality and threats to civilian populations by \nproviding the highest common standards for the \ntrade in arms, ammunition and components. Once \nagain, I should like to thank and congratulate the \nnon-governmental organization community for its \ndedication and tireless efforts in favour of the ATT. \nThey never lost their faith and pushed Governments \nhard to achieve that result. But our work is not yet done. \nTogether we must continue to secure the 50 ratifications \nneeded and ensure more to support for the ATT. We \nmust also persuade those countries that abstained in the \nvoting to support a regulated arms trade and the Treaty \nso as to make it universal.\n\nFinland, as one of the seven co-authors, has from the \nbeginning been and will in future be very much involved \nwith the Arms Trade Treaty. This week, the co-authors \norganized a high-level event to promote the signing \nof the Treaty. We are also prepared to assist countries \nthat have difficulties in ratifying and implementing \nthe Treaty. When implemented, the Treaty should also \nhave a major impact on development, particularly in the \nleast developed countries, where conflicts are a major \nobstacle to development.\n\nThe success or failure of the United Nations \nultimately depends upon us, the Member States. There \nis no alternative to the United Nations. Let us give it a \nchance. That is what our peoples expect from us.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour to once \nagain represent my beloved nation at this rostrum. \nDuring the past decade, when I have had the privilege \nto address the Hall, Georgia has moved from a failed \nState to a market democracy. We have experienced \nboth advances and setbacks, both breakthroughs \nand mistakes. But the world has been able to witness \nmy nation\u2019s constant commitment to freedom. I ask \nmembers today once again to hear the voice of a \nnation that transcends political, social and religious \ndifferences in a common love for freedom \u2014 a voice \nthat, despite all the problems we have encountered and \nthe challenges we still have to overcome, is full of hope. \nLooking at our world today, I think that this voice of \nhope is needed.\n\nThe optimism of the early 1990s, when the spread \nof liberal and democratic values seemed natural, when \nthe end of history had been proclaimed, and when the \nUnited Nations was set to become the heart and the \nsoul of a world finally at peace, the optimism of that \nera \u2014 noticeable when I was a student in New York \nand visited the United Nations as an intern \u2014 was then \ncrushed by a wave of pessimism and cynicism.\n\nThe world is not at peace. Humankind has not \nreconciled with itself, and the United Nations did not \nbecome the heart and soul of a united globe. Western \ncivilization, once triumphant, is now trying to tackle a \ndeep economic, social, and spiritual crisis. In Eastern \nEurope the colour revolutions are challenged by the \nvery forces they defeated a few years ago. In the Middle \nEast the glorious images of cheering crowds in Cairo \nand Tunis have been replaced by the horrendous videos \nof the gassed children of Damascus.\n\nThere are many good reasons to be disillusioned. \nBut should the untrammelled optimism of the 1990s be \nreplaced by an equally untrammelled pessimism, by a \nsense of resignation that stifles hope? Should the fact \nthat the expansion of democracy and freedom turns out \nto require profound struggle cause us to renounce our \nbeliefs and our principles?\n\n\n\f\nI have come here today to share the hopes on behalf \nof my nation and to speak out on behalf of my Georgian \npeople against such pervasive fatalism. I came here to \naddress those who doubt, those who hesitate and those \nwho are tempted to give in.\n\nIf the West is an anachronism, why do millions \nof Poles, Czechs, Estonians, Romanians and others \ncherish so much the day they entered NATO? Why \nare millions of Ukrainians, Georgians, Moldovans \nand others desperately knocking on the doors of the \nEuropean Union?\n\nIf freedom is no longer fashionable, how do we \nexplain that the suicide of a previously unknown citizen \nin a remote Tunisian town has changed the map of the \nworld? No, history did not come to an end in 1989 or \n1991, as was proclaimed, and it never will. Freedom is \nstill its driving force and its goal. Everywhere, men and \nwomen who want to live in freedom are confronted by \nthe forces of tyranny. The question is: are we going to \nbe actors or spectators in that confrontation?\n\nAs I speak, the Eastern European countries aspiring \nto join the European family of free and democratic \nnations are facing constant pressures and threats. \nArmenia has been cornered and forced to sign a customs \nunion that is not in that nation\u2019s interest or in those of \nour region. Moldova is being blockaded. Ukraine is \nunder constant attack. Azerbaijan faces extraordinary \npressure. And Georgia is occupied. Why? Because \nan old empire is trying to reclaim its bygone borders. \n\u201cBorders\u201d is actually not the right word, since that \nempire \u2014 be it the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, \nthe Russian Federation, or the Eurasian Union \u2014 never \nhad borders. It had only margins.\n\nI came today to speak in the name of those margins. \nUnlike most nations, the Russian Federation has no \ninterest in having stable States around it. Neighbouring \ncountries in constant turmoil is what the Kremlin is \nseeking. It rejects the very idea of strong Governments \nin Georgia, Ukraine or Moldova, even ones that try to \nbe friendly to its interests. I was never a great fan of \nwhat the French call \u201cla langue de bois\u201d. But, as my \nsecond term nears its end, I feel the urge more than \nheretofore to speak my mind. Let us be very concrete.\n\nDo members think that Vladimir Putin wants \nArmenia to decisively triumph over Azerbaijan, for \ninstance? No. That would make Armenia too strong and \npotentially too independent. Do members think then \nthat the contrary is true, that Moscow wants Baku to \nprevail over Yerevan? Obviously not. The current rise \nof a modernized, dynamic Azerbaijan is a nightmare for \nRussian leaders. No, they do not want anyone to prevail. \nThe conflict itself is their objective, since it keeps both \nnations dependent and blocks their integration into the \nEuropean common space.\n\nDo members think that the electoral defeat of \nthe forces that led the Orange Revolution in Ukraine \nhas led the Kremlin to take a softer approach to that \ncountry? On the contrary. I spoke yesterday to my \ncolleague Viktor Yanukovych. His Government is \nunder constant attack and pressure from Russia. That \nis what is happening on a daily basis, again ahead of \nthe European summit in Vilnius. Russian officials now \nspeak openly about dismembering that nation. I just \nheard the speech two days ago.\n\nDo members think that the Kremlin would agree to \ndiscuss the de-occupation of our regions of Abkhazia \nand South Ossetia, now that the Government has \nchanged in Tbilisi? Far from it. The annexation of \nGeorgian lands by Russian troops continues. Yesterday, \nthe occupants again expelled Georgian citizens from \ntheir houses and are destroying their villages, homes \nand the houses of their parents and grandparents. In \ndaylight, they are taking over their cemeteries and \nwater systems with total impunity. \n\nDespite the friendly statements made by the \nnew Georgian Government in recent weeks and \nmonths, the Russian military continues to advance its \nposition, dividing communities with new barbed wire, \nthreatening our economy, moving towards the vital \nBaku-Supsa pipeline, approaching closer and closer \nto the main highway of Georgia, and thus putting into \nquestion the very sustainability of our country.\n\nWe are one of very few nations in history \u2014 of which \nI am very proud \u2014 that has, unfortunately, sustained a \nfull-blown attack by Russia. We are the only one, in \nmany centuries, whose statehood and independence \nhave survived, despite a full-blown attack by the more \nthan 100,000-strong Russian army, despite being \nbombed by 200 planes and attacked by the full Russian \nBlack Sea fleet and tens of thousands of mercenaries. \nOur statehood and independence have survived despite \nall of those things. But let us not now risk losing any \nof that in a time of peace. We have survived because \nwere united; we survived because the world was with \nus. I hope that the world will remain with us when that \npressure is on us.\n\n\n\f\nI have come here, in the name of the Georgian \npeople, to ask the international community to react \nstrongly to the aggression and to help us to put an end \nto the Russian annexation of our lands. The hostility of \nVladimir Putin and his team towards the Government \nthat I have had the privilege to lead for almost a decade \nhas not been based on personal hatred or cultural \nmisunderstanding. Any such interpretation was just a \nsmokescreen.\n\nMy predecessor, President Shevardnadze, came \nfrom the highest-level Soviet nomenklatura. He was \nreturned to power in Georgia with direct Russian help \nin the 1990s, through a military coup. He was well \nknown for his Soviet diplomatic skills \u2014 unlike me. \nAnd yet, Russia constantly undermined his authority \nand even tried to assassinate him several times.\n\nIt is not about Gamsakhurdia \u2014 the first President \nof Georgia \u2014 Shevardnadze, Saakashvili, or the present \nPrime Minister Ivanishvili. Those names actually do \nnot matter when the stakes are so high. This is about the \npossibility \u2014 or lack \u2014 of true statehood in Georgia and \nbeyond. Why? Because the current Russian authorities \nknow perfectly well that as soon as strong institutions \nare built in Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova or in any other \nplace \u2014 as soon as functioning States emerge \u2014 such \ninstitutions, such States will reflect and enforce the will \nof their people, which is to become fully independent \nand move towards Europe.\n\nThe Georgian experience of successful reforms \nand the creation of a functioning State was therefore \nconsidered to be a virus \u2014 one that could and would \ncontaminate the whole post-Soviet region. We became \nthe least corrupt country in Europe, the world\u2019s number-\none reformer \u2014 according to the World Bank \u2014 one \nof the top places for business and the least criminal \ncountry in Europe, after having been one of the most \ncriminal. That was the virus that should be eliminated \nby every means possible.\n\nThat is why the Georgian nation has suffered an \nembargo, a war, an invasion and an occupation \u2014 all \nsince 2006. But it is also why the resistance of the \nGeorgian people and the resilience of the Georgian \ndemocracy are of the utmost importance for the whole \nregion.\n\nThe efforts to roll back the advances of the \nEuropean Union and of NATO in our region \u2014 progress \nbased on the will of our people \u2014 are becoming ever \nmore intense. Those efforts have a name: the Eurasian \nUnion. It makes me sick when KGB officer Vladimir \nPutin lectures the world about freedom, values and \ndemocracy. That is the least of the things he can do \nfor the world, as the dictatorial leader of one of the \nlast empires left. But that new project is much more \ndangerous than his lectures. The Eurasian Union has \nbeen shaped as an alternative to the European Union, \nand unveiled by Vladimir Putin as the main project of \nhis new presidency \u2014 a new Russian empire.\n\nBecause European and Euro-Atlantic integration \ntake a lot of time and require tremendous effort; \nbecause there are moments when one might think \none is pursuing a mirage; and because the threats are \nbecoming so strong, the pressure so direct, while the \npromises seem so far away \u2014 some people in our \nregion might fall victim to fatigue and ask themselves, \n\u201cWhy not?\u201d. Today, I want precisely to explore that \n\u201cwhy not?\u201d.\n\nMuch more than with a choice of foreign policy or \nof international alliances, our nations are confronted \nwith a choice of society, a choice of life. Our people \nhave to decide whether they accept to live in a world \nof fear and crime: a world in which differences are \nperceived as threats and minorities as punching bags; \na world in which opponents are faced with selective \njustice or beatings; a world that we in our region all \nknow very well, as do those in some other regions of the \nworld, since this is the world from which we originate.\n\nThe Eurasian Union is both our recent past and \nthe future shaped for us by some ex-KGB officers in \nMoscow. On the opposite side, our revived traditions \nand our centuries-old aspirations have led us towards \nanother world called Europe.\n\nEuropean societies are far from perfect \u2014 we \nall know that. There too, one can have fears, doubts, \nangers, hatreds and social inequality. But there, at \nthe same time, meritocracy prevails over nepotism, \ntolerance is a fundamental of public life and current \nopponents are the future ministers, and not prisoners to \nbe or enemies to beat.\n\nThe choice, when it is expressed in that way, is \nso obvious for the people of our region that some \nKremlin strategists \u2014 they call themselves \u201cpolito-\ntechnologists\u201d \u2014 have decided to cancel the \ntruth and have shaped lies that they are spreading \nthroughout Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova and many \nother places. Their mouthpieces in our respective \ncountries \u2014 that conscious or unconscious so-called \n\n\n\f\nfifth column \u2014 identify the European Union with the \ndestruction of family values, the erosion of national \ntraditions and the promotion of gays and lesbians, \nundermining our traditional religions.\n\nStrangely, in recent years, and even more so in \nrecent months, we hear in Tbilisi, Kiev and Chisinau \nthe same ugly music that was first orchestrated in \nMoscow. We hear that our traditions are collapsing \nunder the influence of the West, that Christian holidays \nwill be replaced by gay pride events and churches by a \nmulticultural Disneyland. We hear that our Orthodox \nidentity is under threat. And after all of that, we hear \nthat we share with our former masters a common \nrespect for decency and traditions.\n\nAre we so naive as to believe the lies of Putin and \nthe others, as other generations have done, allowing \nour sovereignty to be kidnapped? Are we so unfair \nto our ancestors to think that their memory would be \nhonoured by attacks on mosques or by pogroms? Are \nwe so unaware of our own history that we allow it to \nrepeat itself endlessly?\n\nWhen we hear the fake music of the orthodox \nbrotherhood sung by Russian imperialists, can we \nnot hear the true voice of Patriarch Kirion, who was \nassassinated, or the eternal voice of the Patriarch \nAmbrosi Khelaya, who was tortured for days and weeks \nonly because he appealed to the Geneva Conference \nagainst the invasion of his country? He told his Russian \ninterrogators, \u201cYou can have my body, my flesh, but \nyou will never have my soul.\u201d Are we so deaf as not to \nhear the voices of the bishops and priests tortured and \nkilled by Russian imperialists and Russian communists? \nAre we so uneducated that we do not recall who has \nrepainted our churches and erased our sacred frescos? \nAre we so blind today not to see the destruction of our \nchurches by the same people who erased our churches \nin the nineteenth century \u2014 Russians who are now in \nthe occupied territory?\n\nWe need to know our history. Our history teaches us \nthat tolerance is the basis for sovereignty in our region. \nIt is not only a moral duty; it is an issue of national \nsecurity. We need to know our history to understand \nthat the same old imperialistic principle \u2014 divide and \nrule \u2014 is being applied today as it was two centuries \nago.\n\nLooking at our region today, those who have some \nknowledge of Caucasian history might remember the \nArmenian-Azerbaijani bloodshed of 1905, directly \ncreated by the tsarist Administration; compare it to the \nbeginning of the conflict in Karabakh in the late 1980s. \nThe Russian army was present there, in large numbers. \nIn front of its eyes, the war started and they pretended \nto help both sides, but in fact stirred up the conflict.\n\nThey might recall \u2014 as I do too well \u2014 the \nbeginning of the war in the Georgia region of Abkhazia \nin the early 1990s, when Georgian paramilitary groups \nwere getting their weapons from the same Russian \ntroops who were actually leading, directing and \nassisting the Abkhaz militia and bombing Georgian \nterritory and bringing in Chechen mercenaries in order \nto kill any form of solidarity between nations of the \nNorth and the South Caucasus. They did so just as they \nsent \u2014 for the same reason, more than one century \nbefore \u2014 Georgian officers to the front line of their \nwars against the Chechens, Ingush and Dagestanis.\n\nWe could also look at other margins throughout \nthe times. We could look at Poland or Ukraine, and we \nwould see the same pictures. Everywhere it reached, \nthe Empire inflamed the relations between subjugated \npeoples and separated them by a wall of fanatic \nantagonism. Unfortunately, it used to work. But what is \neven more unfortunate is that it is still working today.\n\nThe European Union, the greatest political success \nof recent decades, has been built on three pillars, \nwhich could be characterized as three rejections \u2014 the \nrejection of the extreme nationalists who had led Europe \nto the collective suicide of two world wars and the \nhorrors of nazism; the rejection of communism, which \nwas threatening to be spread throughout the continent \nand the world; and, finally, the rejection of colonialism \nand imperialism. It took time \u2014 and many participants \ntoday, as victims of French imperialism or British \nimperialism, remember it well and painfully \u2014 for \nthe French and British Empires to accept that third \nrejection. But giving up their colonies was the price they \nhad to pay for the modernization of their economies and \nthe development of their democracies. It was also the \nprice to pay for European unification to become fully \nrealized. \n\nThe Eurasian Union is based on the exact opposite \npremise. It is fuelled by intolerance, it is lead by old \nstructures of the KGB, and it is designed to revive an old \nempire. That is what the Eurasian Union is all about. Of \ncourse, joining the Eurasian Union is very easy. There \nare no social, economic or political criteria to be met; \nbecoming a colony, in fact, requires no effort at all. \n\n\n\f\nPassivity, mediocrity, the absence of national pride and \na willingness to be enslaved are the only requirements.\n\nOn the other hand, to form a real union there is \nno alternative but to make a herculean effort and meet \nexact criteria, because principles are precisely what \ncreate a union. To those who doubt, therefore, I say that \nit is precisely because the European Union demands \neffort and imposes criteria for joining \u2014 because the \nEuropean Union does not seek to absorb us while the \nEurasian Union dreams of absorption \u2014 that the choice \nshould be obvious.\n\nBut there is an even better reason for saying that \nthe choice is obvious. The choice is obvious because \nthe Russian project is doomed to fail. No empire is \nsustainable today; we are living in the twenty-first \ncentury. It is certainly not the Russian century, and \nthe Russian Empire is the last, anachronistic empire in \nthe world. If we look back at history, France and the \nUnited Kingdom lost their colonies not only because \nthe colonies fought for their independence, but also \nbecause people in Paris and London ultimately did not \nbelieve in their empire anymore.\n\nExactly the same thing is happening in Russia \nnowadays. The imperial dream is being rejected first, \nas we have seen, at its margins. But, most crucially, \nperhaps, the idea of the Empire is rejected at its very \ncentre. Such a rejection does not manifest itself in public \nprotests alone or in the rising polls of the opposition \nin the main cities of Russia. It expresses itself in the \nuniversal cynicism of Russian elites towards Putin\u2019s \nEurasian vision. The very people who are supposed to \nserve it do not believe in the viability of the project.\n\nRejected at its margins, rejected at its centre, the \nimperialistic path will come to a dead end, the Eurasian \nUnion will fail, and Russia will in the end become a \nnation State with borders, instead of margins \u2014 a real \ncountry with real borders. Then it will start to seek stable \nrelations with stable neighbours. Then cooperation will \nreplace confrontation.\n\nIt will happen, and much sooner than people think, \nto the benefit of the margins, but most of all to the \nbenefit of the Russian people themselves.\n\nIt will happen because the imperial project has \nbecome absurd for a generation of Russian citizens who \nare among the world\u2019s most enthusiastic users of the \nInternet.\n\nIt will happen because ethnic discrimination in \nRussia is being used in its territories, but it will not \nmake Russia a stronger and more united State. \n\nIt will happen because the endless resources \nprovided by the revenues of oil and gas are challenged \nby the perspectives offered by the exploitation of shale \ngas and shale oil. The shale gas revolution is really \nundermining the last authoritarian empire in the world.\n\nIt will happen because gas alone does not replace \neconomic modernization.\n\nIt will happen because of corruption and the \nabsence of justice.\n\nIt will happen because entire regions have been \nalienated by discrimination and violence \u2014 because the \npeople of Chechnya, Ingushetia, Dagestan, Tatarstan, \nBashkortostan and many other places have been so \npersecuted that they do not feel part of any common \nproject with the central authorities in Moscow.\n\nIt will happen because the frustrations, angers and \nhatreds are too strong to bear and the unifying ideal is \ntoo absent.\n\nIt will happen, not in the coming decades but in \nthe coming years. A few years from now, the Assembly \nwill recall my words. Vladimir Putin will have left the \nKremlin and vanished from Russian politics, even if \nhe says that he will be there for another 20 years or \nmore. Russian citizens will remember him as a ghost \nfrom the old times \u2014 from the times of corruption and \noppression. \n\nNobody knows whether the process will be calm or \nviolent, whether his successor will be nationalistic or \nliberal, or both together, but what matters is something \nelse \u2014 Russia will no longer be an empire. It will \nbecome, finally, a normal nation State. That is the \nhorizon we should all prepare for together.\n\nMeanwhile, as our region remains an area of \nconfrontation, the formerly captive nations should \nunite their strengths instead of cultivating their \ndivisions. Some leaders and some countries in the past \nunderstood that the freedom of one was dependent on \nthe freedom of all the other subjugated nations, like \nPoland, which for many centuries dreamed of uniting \nall persecuted people, or like the Poland of Marshal \nPilsudski, which invited all the oppressed people \nor their officers to unite under the flag of Polish \nindependence and Polish military forces. But never did \n\n\n\f\nour ancestors benefitefrom a force that was vast and \npowerful enough, that understood its strategic interest \nwas to preserve the sovereignty of each of our nations. \nToday that force exists; it is, with all its deficiencies, \nthe European Union.\n\nAs we come closer to the Vilnius Eastern \nPartnership Summit, I would like to reiterate a call \nthat I have made several times in the recent years. By \nlaunching the Eastern Partnership as a response to the \n2008 invasion of Georgia, the European Union has \noffered to our nations a platform for us to cooperate \nunder its benevolent umbrella. We should invest much \nmore in it. We should develop common projects, first \nand foremost focusing on the necessary reforms that we \nshould carry out together, because reforms mean for all \nof us statehood and independence.\n\nRussian Empress Catherine II knew it well. When \nPoland started to successfully implement an ambitious \nprogramme of reforms based on precepts from the \nFrench and British Enlightenments despite Russian \nattempts to counter those reforms, she wrote a long \nand secret letter to the German Emperor, Frederick the \nGreat of Prussia. The letter was and remains one of the \nmost impressive expressions of the nature and strategy \nof the imperialistic project. It states that the ongoing \nreforms were dangerous for both Russia and Prussia \nbecause they would turn Poland into a true State, \nthat the reforms needed to be stopped and that Poland \nshould be attacked and dismembered before reforms \nwere fully implemented so that it never needed to be \noccupied again. \n\nThe letter will not sound unfamiliar to those who \nknow how much Vladimir Putin loathed the Georgian \nexperience during the past decade. Many Russians \nwere asking, if the once-corrupt Georgia, a criminal \ncountry, a mafia-ridden country, considered to be a \nfailed country, could succeed, why is it that Russia \ncannot succeed? It was an ideologically dangerous \nproject. For the first time, an efficient nation State was \nbeing built in the Caucasus, and the reforms had to be \ncrushed before they could bear all their fruits. \n\nUnity should be our rule in Eastern Europe, \nincluding in the divided Caucasus. I have spoken about \nthe beginnings of the war in Abkhazia. I could have \nrecalled an older scene that symbolically characterizes \nthe history of the Caucasus. It was at the end of the \nrebellion led by Shamil, the great imam of the Northern \nCaucasus, against the Russian Empire, after Shamil \nhad surrendered and after the last Chechen leader still \nfighting, Baysongour, had been wounded and captured. \nAs Baysongour was going to be hanged, the Russian \nofficers brought together a crowd of Dagestani men \nto witness the execution. They ordered one of them to \nremove the chair on which Baysongour was standing \nin order to execute him. The Russians knew what they \nwere doing \u2014 they hoped to fuel the local vendettas \nand oppose the people, which is an old tradition in \nthe Caucasus. Seeing that, the valiant commander \nBaysongour moved the chair himself, committing a \nsuicide forbidden under all religions, including Islam, \nand preserving the relations between neighbours.\n\nDespite that one failure, how many times has the \nstrategy of dividing neighbours encountered success \namong the nations of the Caucasus? It needs to come \nto an end. That is why I have launched several projects \nduring my presidency to reinforce the people-to-\npeople contacts between North and South Caucasus, \nprojects focusing mostly on education and on university \nexchange. That is why the Georgian Parliament has \nrecognized the genocide of the Cherkezian people \u2014 one \nof the least known and tragic pages of the history of the \nworld, when an entire nation was wiped because their \nland was needed by the Russian Empire. \n\nWe need to build on those efforts. We need to \nprepare for the time when the Empire collapses, so \nthat its legacy of hatred is swiftly overcome. And we, \nas citizens of Georgia, need to prepare for the time \nwhen Russian troops will leave our occupied regions, \nwhen Moscow will withdraw from Tskhinvali and \nSukhumi, Abkhazia. We need to prepare ourselves to \nwelcome back our Ossetian and Abkhaz fellow citizens \nas brothers and sisters and not as enemies. We need \nto prepare for the time when hundreds of thousands, \nin fact, more than half a million, internally displaced \nGeorgians and members of other ethnic groups return \nto their deserted homes, because that time will come \nmuch sooner than we think. \n\nAs my second term nears its end, I take pride in \nGeorgia\u2019s many accomplishments during my tenure. We \nushered Georgia out of a state of darkness, introduced \nunprecedented transparency into our public service, put \nour children back in school and got rid of the gangs. \nWe have brought our nation closer than ever before to \nits European dream and worked tirelessly to renew the \nspirit of tolerance that guided Georgia in our glorious \npast.\n\n\n\f\nWe did many good things, but like any leader \u2014 and \nwhen I became President, I was then the youngest \npresident in the world \u2014 I realize that some things were \ndone at a very high cost because of lack of experience. In \nour rush to impose a new reality against the background \nof internal and external threats, we cut corners and \ncertainly made mistakes. At times we went too far and \nat other times not far enough. I fully acknowledge my \nresponsibility in that regard, and I sincerely feel for all \nthose who believe that they did not benefit enough from \nour work, or even that they were victims of our radical \nmethods.\n\nI want to tell all Georgian citizens \u2014 those who \nsupported our project, our policies and our party and \nthose who rejected them \u2014 how proud I am of their \nmaturity. We promised them this project, but we did not \npromise them that it would be smooth going. We were \nvery ambitious, and that was because our people were \nso mature and so brave. I want to tell them from this \nrostrum how humble I feel in the light of the sacrifices \nand the efforts they made.\n\nWe are and should remain a nation united in a \ncommon love for freedom and dignity. We are and \nshould remain a nation united in the deepest respect \nfor the sacrifices made by our soldiers, a nation \nsharing the same sorrow when they lose their lives - in \nAfghanistan, for instance - and taking the same pride \nin their bravery. We are a nation that is proud of our \nsoldiers, who stood up to a force of Russian invaders \none hundred times the size of our contingent, and gave \nus and the world time to mobilize and to protect and \nsave our independence \u2014 something that, with all \ndue respect, many much bigger and more powerful \nnations could not do in the twentieth century. We are \nand we should remain a nation united in our historical \nidentity and our desire to join the European family of \ndemocratic nations, the family we should never have \nbeen separated from in the first place, our family. The \npath of the Georgian people towards freedom, regional \nunity and European integration is far from over, and \nI will continue to dedicate every day of my life to its \nsuccess, as a proud citizen of a proud nation.\n"

        "file_text": "We praise the almighty Allah \nfor making possible yet again this gathering of world \nleaders. I would like to congratulate President Ashe \non his election to preside over the General Assembly \nat its sixty-eighth session. His impeccable credentials \nand extensive experience in multilateralism will \nundoubtedly enrich the debates and proceedings of this \nsession. He has the full support of my delegation. In the \nsame vein, I wish also to pay tribute to his predecessor, \nMr. Vuk Jeremi., for his sterling leadership during \nthe sixty-seventh session. Our special thanks go to \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his stewardship \nand for the commitment he has manifested to the \nwelfare of humanity, particularly of the third world.\n\nI take this opportunity also to convey our heartfelt \ncondolences to the President, the Government and the \npeople of Kenya, who have suffered one of the most \nheinous crimes against humanity. Our hearts go out to \nthe families of the victims. This is a clear manifestation \nof the fact that terrorism in all its forms cannot be \naccepted. This also has nothing to do with our noble \nreligion, Islam.\n\nAs we gather for the sixty-eighth session of the \nAssembly, we must pause and take stock of our collective \nrecord in responding to the many different global \nchallenges with which mankind has had to grapple. Our \nglobal body, the United Nations, has indeed adopted \ncountless resolutions, which, if implemented to the \nletter, would have made the world a much better place \nfor the whole of mankind and, indeed, for all other \ncreatures on our planet.\n\nUnfortunately, some Member States continue to \ndisregard resolutions necessary for the maintenance \nof world peace and even question or disregard with \nimpunity resolutions adopted by the Assembly. The \nUnited Nations continues to be incapacitated as a \nresult. This certainly calls for an assessment of its \nstrengths and weaknesses, with a view to rendering \nit more effective. Civil strife and terrorism caused \nby the negative behaviour of some world Powers are \nundermining human security and even the viability \nof States. Poverty, hunger and disease still decimate \ncountless communities, while our capacity to respond \f\nto these man-made humanitarian crises remains \ndiscriminatory and inadequate.\n\nThis is demonstrated yet again in the case of Syria. \nWe believe that this Organization was established in \nthe first place to find lasting solutions for peace and the \nprotection of human life. Informed and honest decisions \nshould be made instead of those driven by the interests of \na few self-appointed gods, thereby causing irreparable \ndamage to the social fabric and economies of countries \nin conflict. My Government supports the view that the \nregional organizations in the Middle East should take \nthe lead in the negotiations towards the resolution of \nthe crisis in Syria. The tragedy unfolding in Syria has \nbecome a scar on our conscience as civilized people, \nand that war must be stopped by any means necessary.\n\nAll that we hear is the talk about chemical weapons \nand the need to ensure that they are not used by anyone. \nThis does not make any sense as long as this barbaric \nwar lasts. Whether or not chemical weapons are used, \nthousands of people will continue to die in the most \nhorrific manner. It is the same horrific and senseless \ndeath in both cases, and our duty is not to choose which \nform of death is acceptable and which not. Our duty is \nto stop the senseless and barbaric killings in Syria. We, \nthe United Nations, must end that war immediately; \notherwise the people of Syria will continue to perish at \nthe hands of satanic and sadistic forces. The Security \nCouncil and all the Powers behind the war in Syria \nmust not only prevent the use of chemical weapons but \nmust also bring this brutal war to an immediate end \nwithout preconditions. The Syrian war must be stopped \nand stopped now.\n\nThe 2013 report on Africa\u2019s performance towards \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) reveals mixed results. Africa\u2019s substantial \nprogress towards many goals, targets and indicators \nis beyond doubt, but serious challenges still remain, \nespecially in translating economic growth into decent \njob opportunities, improving service delivery and \nminimizing income, gender and spatial inequalities. \nViolent conflicts and economic shocks in some \ncountries, as well as unprecedented natural disasters \nover the decade induced by climate change, have \ncaused setbacks in the achievement of the MDGs in \nmany countries.\n\nDespite such challenges, some African countries, \nand the Gambia in particular, are making impressive \ngains towards some of the established goals. My \nGovernment is on track to achieve the education MDG \ntarget for net enrolment in primary education and \nliteracy rate among the population aged between 15 \nand 24 years. My Government has made serious and \ninformed policy reviews to prioritize basic primary \neducation, while expanding access to secondary, higher \nand tertiary education, with an emphasis on improving \nquality in all areas. We are working diligently to ensure \nthat the gender disparity gap in enrolment is closed by \n2014 and to provide free education and an equitable \nchance for all to be literate by 2015 and beyond.\n\nWe must ensure that the post-2015 development \nagenda builds on the important progress of the \nMDGs and is expanded to cover broader sustainable \ndevelopment issues, as agreed in Rio. Therefore, the \nchoice of the theme for this session, \u201cThe post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage\u201d, is indeed apt, \ntimely and thought-provoking. Clear, time-bound, \ntargeted and measurable global benchmarks are crucial \nif we are to realize our desired objective.\n\nProtecting African livelihoods requires \ninternational, regional and country approaches \nthat recognize and act on the overlap of conflicts \norchestrated by foreign Powers and severe weather \nhazards. The Gambia firmly believes that mitigating \nthe adverse effects of climate change and putting an \nimmediate end to the massive looting of African natural \nresources by Western multinational companies call for \na timely and decisive global response. It is a challenge \nthat should unite us, not divide us. The Gambia is of \nthe firm opinion that Africa should play an active role \nin shaping the goals based on its own development \npriorities and common interests.\n\nThe greatest threats to human existence are basically \nthree and are a consequence of human behaviours which \nare ungodly attributes. They are: excessive greed, and \ntherefore addiction to accumulating material wealth \nby any means, mostly through violent or immoral \nschemes; an obsession with world domination by any \nmeans, including the resolve to use nuclear, biological \nand chemical weapons to achieve that fanciful dream; \nand homosexuality in all its forms and manifestations, \nwhich, though very evil, anti-human and anti-Allah, is \nbeing promoted as a human right by some Powers.\n\nNone of the three threats, which are more deadly \nthan all natural disasters put together, has anything \nto do with climate change. The first led not only \nto colonization and the plundering of African and \nAsian human and material resources but also to two \ndevastating wars among the Western Powers, which \n\n\n\f\nwere unfortunately wrongly termed \u201cworld\u201d wars. \nColonialism was maintained by subjugation and \nmassive looting of resources in the colonies, leading \nto the impoverishment and destitution of hundreds of \nmillions of colonial subjects.\n\nFrom the thirteenth century until the middle part \nof the twentieth century, the notions of human rights, \ngood governance and democracy were philosophies \nforbidden to Africans. Any African under a colonial \nGovernment who advocated for them ended up either \nat the gallows, in a mass grave or rotting in colonialist-\nbuilt dungeons called prisons. This was during the \ncolonial era, when the African continent was treated \nlike an abandoned game park and Africans were treated \nworse than animals.\n\nToday, after fighting for our freedom and \nliberating our continent, we are being prescribed a \nnew religion \u2014 democracy, human rights and good \ngovernance \u2014 by descendants of the same colonial \nPowers. Present-day Africans cannot be hoodwinked \nby anyone, any more, and we are determined to defend \nour independence and dignity, and to take control of \nour own natural resources at any cost and by any means \nnecessary.\n\nIn regard to the second threat, the obsession with \nworld domination, we are seeing the unprecedented \ndevelopment of deadly nuclear, biological and chemical \nweapons, as well as other weapons of mass murder, by \nthe same Powers. We all agree that all forms of human \ntragedy and catastrophe emanate from the West. They \nhave spent more money on killer technologies than on \nmedical and agricultural technology up to today. If they \nunleash a third world war, God forbid, that would put an \nend to human existence on planet Earth, including the \nUnited Nations itself.\n\nAs for the third threat, we know for a fact that all \nliving things need to reproduce for posterity. They \nbecome extinct when they can no longer reproduce. \nTherefore, the Assembly will all agree with me that \nany person promoting the end of human reproduction \nmust be promoting human extinction. Could it be called \npromoting human rights when one advocates for a \ndefinitive end to human reproduction and procreation? \nThose who promote homosexuality want to put an \nend to human existence. It is becoming an epidemic, \nand we Muslims and Africans will fight against such \nbehaviour in our countries. We will never accept it. We \nwant a brighter future for humankind and the continued \nexistence of humankind on the planet; therefore, we \nwill never tolerate any agenda that clearly calls for \nhuman extinction.\n\nPeace and security are inextricably linked to \ndevelopment. The Gambia continues to abide by \nand live by that principle, which has warranted \nmy Government\u2019s relentless commitment to peace \ninitiatives under the auspices of the African Union and \nthe Economic Community of West African States, one \nof which successfully culminated in a democratically \nelected Government in Mali a few weeks ago. I seize \nthe opportunity, therefore, to congratulate the brotherly \npeople of Mali for giving peace a chance by electing a \nGovernment through democratic means.\n\nWith more concerted efforts through consultations \nand dialogue, we shall also soon witness a lasting \nsolution to the political impasse in Guinea-Bissau. I am \nalso happy with the work currently being undertaken by \nthe African Union High-Level Panel for Egypt, which \nseeks to achieve an inclusive and peaceful transition \nthrough dialogue, compromise, reconciliation and \ntolerance. My Government will continue to use its \nmembership in the Peace and Security Council of the \nAfrican Union to propose peaceful measures that will \nfacilitate enhanced engagements aimed at achieving the \ndesired results in our common quest for lasting stability \nin the African continent.\n\nHowever, the present trends across the world cast \nserious doubts about the effectiveness of the conflict \n-prevention and management mechanisms adopted \nby regional organizations and, most importantly, \nthe United Nations. Instead of acting as an effective \nmechanism for conflict prevention and resolution, as \nwell as advancing global security, the Security Council \nhas become a barrier to progress, peace and security \nin some instances where lopsided decisions can only \nbe classified as racist and misguided and therefore \nunacceptable.\n\nAfrica\u2019s legitimate quest for full representation on \nthe Security Council continues to be a strong warning \nthat needs to be urgently heeded. International peace \nand security are the business of all, and Africa, a \ncontinent whose resources, ranging from material to \nhuman, have helped to bail the West out of poverty to \nreach affluence from the thirteenth century up until \ntoday, cannot be expected to continue to play second \nfiddle in the Security Council or in any international \norganization from now on. The Gambia remains resolute \nin its stance that the permanent and non-permanent \nmembership categories of the Security Council should \n\n\n\f\nbe equitably distributed regionally and expanded to \nconform to current geopolitical realities. The Gambia \nstands by Africa\u2019s demand for two permanent seats as \nwell as two non-permanent seats, as clearly articulated \nin the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.\n\nHow long will the international community \ncontinue to ignore the legitimate right and aspirations \nof a continent of 53 States, all members of the General \nAssembly? The calls have been very loud and very \nclear, but some Western Powers continue to ignore \nthem. That must end, or the Assembly will see a very \ndignified, determined and independent Africa assert its \nlegitimate rights worldwide in its own way.\n\nMy delegation strongly condemns the application of \nunilateral and degrading coercive measures as a means \nof settling disputes. Such measures have an adverse \nimpact on the lives of innocent people, who lack any \nmeans of defending their legitimate sovereignty in the \nface of massive military might. We find the continued \napplication of such measures against the peace-loving \npeople of Cuba to be inhumane and unjust and a \nblatant violation of the basic human rights tenets of \nthe Charter of the United Nations, which, ironically, \nwere promulgated to prevent such behaviour in the first \nplace.\n\nIt is in that spirit that the Gambia shares the \nviews expressed by the international community in its \ncontinued unequivocal opposition to the United States \nof America\u2019s sanctions against Cuba. The embargo \nagainst Cuba contravenes the fundamental principles \nof international law, international humanitarian law, \nthe Charter of the United Nations and the norms and \nprinciples governing peaceful relations among States, \nviolating the sovereign equality of States and the \nprinciples of non-intervention and non-interference \nin the domestic affairs of other Member States. The \nembargo has no legitimate or moral justification, given \nthe fact that it continues to undermine the fundamental \nbasic rights to economic emancipation and the \ndevelopment aspirations of the Cuban people. As a \nresponsible member of the international community, \nthe Gambia therefore joins other Member States in \ncalling for the immediate repeal of laws, measures or \npolicies that impede the free flow of international trade \nand navigation against Cuba.\n\nWe also reiterate our call for a serious and decisive \nreassessment of our policy towards the Republic \nof China on Taiwan. The concerns of the 23 million \nhard-working and peace-loving people of that great \ncountry continue to be ignored. The Republic of China \non Taiwan has a democratically elected Government, \nwhich is the only legitimate Government that defends \nthe interests of the people of Taiwan in the conduct of \nworld affairs and in its many serious interactions with \neach and every nation of the world. The Taiwanese \npeople have the same concerns as all of us with regard \nto global problems. Yet they are not a member of the \nvital organs of the global body to contribute their share \nin the search for solutions to those problems.\n\nThe situation in the occupied Palestinian territory \nremains pathetic as a result of decades of collective \npunishment, fraught with the glaringly degrading \nand inhumane treatment of innocent civilians and \nthe gross denial of access to humanitarian assistance \nand basic services, and essential medical supplies and \nconstruction materials, which has become the daily \nrule rather than the exception for the Palestinians. The \npattern and frequency of those human rights abuses, as \nwell as the disproportionate use of force perpetrated by \nthe occupying Power, continues unabated.\n\nThe Gambia is of the conviction that the ongoing \nseizure of Palestinian lands and properties to make way \nfor illegal settlement activity is morally and politically \nunacceptable. Such uncalled-for behaviour on the part \nof Israel is in blatant disregard for international law \nand casts serious doubt on Israel\u2019s intention to seek \ngenuine and lasting peace with its brothers and sisters, \nthe Palestinian people. How can the international \ncommunity and the United Nations continue to watch \nsuch glaring injustice and protracted human rights \nabuses in silence, without feeling an iota of guilt for not \ntaking bold and appropriate steps to bring them to an \nend? How long should we allow such blatant disregard \nfor international law to continue unpunished?\n\nWhile we welcome the resumption of peace talks \nbetween Israel and Palestine, we hope that this time \naround the brokers will be decent and honest enough \nto ensure that both sides are genuinely committed to \na two-State solution that would eventually usher in \npermanent peace and security in the Middle East and \nbeyond.\n\nWe live in a world of new and evolving \nthreats \u2014 threats that could not have been anticipated \nwhen the United Nations was founded in 1945. Unilateral \nbullying and the criminal invasion of resource-endowed \nsovereign States under the pretext of strengthening \ndemocratization, combined with terrorism, organized \ncrime, poverty and disease, will remain a serious threat \n\n\n\f\nto global peace and security unless appropriate steps \nare taken to eradicate them. Meeting such challenges \ntoday calls for sincerity and honesty to mount well-\ncoordinated and concerted global efforts.\n\nThe Gambia firmly believes that socioeconomic \ndevelopment and respect for the sovereign rights \nof countries to control their own natural resources, \nespecially minerals, should be the collective line \nof defence for a collective global security system \nthat takes the sovereignty of each nation seriously. \nCombating poverty will not only save millions of \nlives but also strengthen States\u2019 capacities to combat \nterrorism, organized crime and intra-State conflict. \nWe need renewed and genuine global partnerships and \ncommitments that are binding and based on respect for \nthe sovereign right of each individual State to choose \na way of life that is based on its religious and cultural \nvalues, as no administrative system is better than the \nway prescribed by the almighty Allah.\n\nIt is also necessary to increase the credibility and \neffectiveness of the Security Council by making sure \nthat selective justice is abandoned and rejected by \nall Members of the United Nations family. From all \nindications, there is an imperative need to inject new \nideas and impetus into the Security Council and to \nexpand its membership to reflect current geopolitical \nrealities. Moreover, respect for the principle of equal \nsovereign rights of peoples and the need to promote and \nrespect peaceful relations among all States, rich or poor, \nblack or white, should be the overriding considerations \nfor the peaceful coexistence of Member States \u2014 that \nis, if 2015 and beyond is to bequeath a peaceful and \nprosperous world to future generations of the human \nrace.\n\n"

        "file_text": "It \nis an honour to join other speakers in addressing the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. This \nyear the Assembly has as its theme \u201cThe post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage\u201d. These annual \nmeetings are thus an opportunity to consider and reflect \non the course that each of our countries is following to \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).\n\nThere can be no doubt that recent events have posed \na major challenge to the achievement of prosperity, \ndevelopment and progress, especially in those regions \nof the world that have suffered most from the effects of \nthe international economic crisis and of climate change. \nEl Salvador has been no exception.\n\nWhen, on 1 June 2009, the Government that I head \ntook power, the nation\u2019s economic growth rate was at \nnegative 3 per cent, with 40,000 jobs lost. There had \nbeen a considerable drop in exports, especially to the \nUnited States, our principal market. Income from taxes \nand family remittances had decreased, and broad sectors \nof the population were impoverished or excluded from \nthe benefits of public policies.\n\nBut that harsh reality was not just a product of the \ncrisis. It was the result of decades of the implementation \nof economic and social models that excluded the great \nmajority and promoted backwardness and injustice. As \nfrom June 2009, with the process of political alternation \nin El Salvador, that reality began to shift.\n\nAs soon as our Government took power, we made a \ncommitment to achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals and to use them as a road map. The Government\u2019s \nfive-year plan states that our strategic plan is to have \na healthy, educated and productive population with \nthe capacity and appropriate opportunities to fully \ndevelop its potential to become the foundation of our \ndevelopment. The Government\u2019s plan incorporates \nstrategic instruments and policies aimed at achieving \nthe MDGs over the short and medium term. We took \nthe strategic decision not to shift the costs of the crisis \nonto the poorest segments of the population, as had \nbeen the habit in the past.\n\nFor that reason, we devised and implemented \npolicies aimed at combating poverty, reducing \n\n\f\ninequality, achieving a process of social inclusion and \ncreating new institutional mechanisms that would make \nit possible to more equitably distribute wealth and the \nbenefits of economic growth.\n\nOur Government put an end to the old concept \nof the patrimonial State, which defended only the \ninterests of small political and economic groups. \nNow the Salvadoran State is at the service of the \nmost underprivileged. That shift in public policy has \ntranslated into an increasingly modern and effective \nState that is fighting poverty, social exclusion, violence \nand corruption. Thus this new type of governance, \nwhich is based on the implementation of best practices, \ntransparent and increasingly participatory, has already \nbegun to have a positive impact on the achievement of \nthe MDGs, as demonstrated by the following results.\n\nEl Salvador has made great progress towards \neliminating poverty and hunger. In the past year, we \nnot only achieved but exceeded the goal of reducing the \nnumber of households living in extreme poverty. We \nalso made major achievements when it comes to access \nto education. In 1991, the net coverage for primary \neducation was 75 per cent of the population; last year it \nwas 93 per cent. We have gained almost 20 percentage \npoints in those years. \n\nSince the beginning of my Administration, \nall students in public schools \u2014 some 1.3 million \nchildren and young people \u2014 have received free shoes, \nuniforms and school supplies. The impact of this was \nimmediately noticeable, as we increased enrolment \nwhile dramatically reducing the dropout rate. Twenty \nyears ago, 85 per cent of the population of working \nage was literate, but this rate has now reached almost \n100 per cent. Over for the past four years alone, the \nGovernment has managed to reduce the illiteracy rate \nby 5 per cent. With the help of thousands of volunteers, \nwe are teaching over 170,000 adults to read.\n\nIn terms of health, one of the achievements we are \nmost proud of is related to the significant reduction in \nmaternal mortality, one of the two sections of Millennium \nDevelopment Goal 5. With the health-care reform \nundertaken by my Administration, we have increased \naccess to health services by hiring more doctors, \nnurses and specialists and establishing new women\u2019s \ncentres. Pursuant to the Millennium Development \nGoals, the objective is to achieve a maternal mortality \nrate that is equal to or below 52.8 maternal deaths per \n100,000 inhabitants by 2015. We have reached that \ngoal in El Salvador and even exceeded expectations by \nreducing the rate to 41.9 maternal deaths per 100,000, \nor 11 fewer than the target for this Goal.\n\nThe comprehensive health-care reform initiative \nthat we launched has been tasked with bringing health-\ncare services to the most remote corners of our country \nthat, historically, have been isolated from economic \nand social development. This firm commitment of \nour Government has led us to increase the health-care \nbudget by 60 per cent over a period of four years. That \nhas allowed us to increase the supply of medicines in \nhospitals and public health clinics by between 50 to \n82 per cent in that time and to significantly expand \nthe proportion of the population who are immunized. \nSimilarly, free health consultations mandated by our \nGovernment have contributed to a 40 per cent increase \nin demand for such services, which represents a \nsignificant step in our goal to extend that service to the \nmajority of the population. \n\nI cannot speak of advances in health care \nwithout talking about access to and improvement \nof basic services such as drinking water. Our efforts \nhave gradually borne fruit in the areas under our \nresponsibility in this respect. We have met the target \nof 71 per cent of households having treated water piped \ninto their houses. In 2011, under our Government, this \nwas already true of 72 per cent of households. Sanitation \nis covered by another Millennium Development Goal, \nwhich set the target of 89 per cent of households having \nthis service by 2015. As of two years ago, 96 per cent of \nSalvadoran households had access to sanitation.\n\nIn summary, great efforts have been undertaken \nto achieve the best possible outcome on each of the \nindicators, leading to enhanced well-being for all \nSalvadorans. I believe that the time has come to conceive \nof social programmes for people as an investment and \nnot as an expense, or even worse as a waste, as some \nleaders in the country mistakenly continue to believe, \nstuck as they are in their stingy and outdated ways of \nthinking.\n\nIt is clear that the gains we have made in my \ncountry in recent years have not been the result of \nchance. El Salvador is going through a period of great \nchange. This profound transformation has occurred \nfirst through a change in the economic model that has \nset a different course for our nation. We are working \nprimarily on restoring the vitality of our countryside \nin order to make it once again a central engine for \neconomic development. \n\n\n\f\nThanks to our family agriculture plan, which \nprovides small and medium-sized farms with free \ndelivery of improved seed packets and fertilizer, \ntraining and access to technology and credit, last \nyear we had record food-crop harvests and were still \nable to keep the price of basic grains within reach of \nthe entire population of El Salvador. We have also \nsuccessfully implemented school lunch programmes, \nso that children receive at school fresh, healthy food \ngrown on Salvadoran farms. Today, more than 800,000 \npoor Salvadoran children receive two glasses of fresh \nmilk a week in school as part of their diet. All these \nefforts have brought more prosperity to Salvadorans, \nespecially the poorest. \n\nBut in addition to poverty, there are other scourges \nsuch as violence, drug trafficking and organized crime \nthat deprive our people of well-being and happiness. \nWith this in mind, we have implemented public policies \nto reduce violence and fight crime.\n\nThe Government has created new police units, \noverseen the graduation of 4,000 new agents and \nredoubled operational plans to curb crime. At the same \ntime, a non-aggression pact between the two main youth \ngangs was agreed on two years ago. The Government \nwas only a facilitator of that pact, which has established \nthe minimal conditions to reduce gang violence levels \nin the areas most affected by that phenomenon. Thus, \nongoing crime suppression and prevention efforts have \nresulted in a 50 per cent reduction in homicides. The \nGovernment\u2019s security policy has also dealt a heavy \nblow to organized crime gangs, allowing for significant \nseizures of drug shipments. \n\nWe know, however, that huge challenges remain. \nThere are major obstacles to development that will not \nbe overcome in my new Administration\u2019s four years in \npower. I would highlight in particular the challenges \nrepresented by climate change and the resulting need \nto protect and safeguard the lives of tens of thousands \nof Salvadorans. We are a region exposed to extreme \nweather phenomena, at least five of which El Salvador \nhas experienced in recent years. They have had the \ngreatest impact on the most vulnerable parts of the \npopulation and the country\u2019s infrastructure, causing \nlosses in the billions of dollars.\n\nA major challenge is to build a sufficiently fair and \ndemocratic society that is respectful of those who make \nup the majority of the population \u2014 women. El Salvador \nhas undertaken serious efforts to achieve goals derived \nfrom the Millennium Development Goals in the area \nof gender equality and the prevention, punishment and \neradication of violence against women.\n\nIn addition to establishing a confidential call \ncentre for reporting gender violence, the Government \nhas approved the first national policy against human \ntrafficking and achieved a considerable decrease in \nwomen\u2019s deaths by homicide. Without a doubt, the \nmost valuable contribution in this area lies in the City \nof Women initiative, through which we have created \nfour comprehensive care centres for women and are \non track to create two more, scheduled to open later \nthis year. This initiative is already considered by \ninternational organizations and world leaders a model \nof public management. It is a comprehensive and \nintegrated system of specialized services for women in \nthe areas of sexual and reproductive health, economic \nempowerment \u2014 through both formal employment \nand support for entrepreneurship \u2014 and prevention \nand treatment of gender-based violence. It also helps \nto focus the priorities and attention of my Government \non women.\n\nAnother tangible demonstration of the ongoing \nprocess is the dialogue undertaken to achieve reparations \nfor victims of gross violations of human rights and the \nvindication of the rights of war veterans. With regard \nto the latter, we have succeeded in repaying a debt that \nadminstrations prior to ours had failed for years to \nrecognize and to repay. Moreover, my Government has \npromoted a reconciliation process without precedent in \nthe nation\u2019s history and a recognition of the human rights \natrocities committed in El Salvador. As Head of State, I \nasked forgiveness for the disappearances, murders and \ntorture, and from all those who experienced the brunt \nof such abuses during our civil war. I ordered a dialogue \nwith organizations representing the victims of serious \nhuman rights violations. As a result of this process, in \nthe days to come I will announce a national reparations \nprogramme, which will include the ratification of \nvarious treaties human rights adopted by the General \nAssembly and a guarantee that such violations will \nnever recur.\n\nThe right to food, education and welfare must be \nensured in order to achieve sustainable development \nand eradicate poverty. In that respect, all the efforts \nof national Governments must be complemented and \nstrengthened with the support of the international \ncommunity and the United Nations system.\n\nRadical change is needed in the global economic \nsystem, which is based on financial speculation \n\n\n\f\nand consumerism and not only has an impact on the \nmost developed economies of the world, but also \nand especially makes the least developed countries \neven poorer. International cooperation must seek \nfundamentally to improve the productive capacities of \nour countries and to invest in people suffering from \npoverty and exclusion. My Government believes that \nthe path to growth is investment in the poor and their \ntransformation into a middle class with access to health \ncare and education.\n\nI invoke international solidarity and the agenda of \nthe General Assembly in which we are gathered here \ntoday in order to advocate once again for the lifting \nof the blockade against Cuba. I have made this same \nrequest in my previous statements before this forum, \nas I believe that Cuba is part of the American soul and \nthat the blockade is a relic of the past. The brotherly \npeople of Cuba, like all peoples of the world, have \nthe right to seek development and well-being through \ncomprehensive integration.\n\nSimilarly, we support diplomatic efforts seeking \na swift peaceful solution to the conflict in Syria. We \ncondemn the use of chemical weapons, and we support \nthe agreement between Russia and the United States \nwhereby Syria\u2019s chemical weapons would be destroyed \nunder the supervision of the United Nations.\n\nBefore I conclude, I should like to express my firm \nbelief that the United Nations will take the necessary \nsteps to guarantee the development and implementation \nof a comprehensive post-2015 agenda. In that context, I \nbelieve that we will realize a better and fairer world for \nall of humankind.\n\nIn El Salvador, we are preparing to implement that \nagenda. We are happy to be among the few countries \nin Latin America working on multidimensional \npoverty measurement. Next year we hope to use these \nstatistics to complement our income-based poverty \nmeasurement. We will thereby be in a better position \nto implement comprehensive policies that will allow us \nto eradicate poverty in a definitive and lasting way. I \nthank the United Nations for its invaluable cooperation \nin the pursuit of our major aspirations as a nation, and \nthe Assembly for its attention.\n"

        "file_text": "I bring to you, Mr. President, \nand through you to all representatives the warm \ngreetings and good wishes of His Majesty Jigme Khesar \nNamgyel Wangchuck. Allow me also to congratulate \nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I assure \nyou of my delegation\u2019s full support and cooperation as \nyou steer the important work of this session.\n\nI am deeply honoured to have the opportunity to \naddress the Assembly for the first time. I do so owing \nto the mandate accorded by the people of Bhutan to the \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Party at the second parliamentary \nelections held this summer.\n\nThe second parliamentary elections were yet \nanother milestone on the path of democracy that Bhutan \nchose to undertake five years ago. In 2008 there were \ntwo political parties, whereas four parties contested this \nyear\u2019s elections. The people of Bhutan voted for change \nand ushered in a new Government. These, I believe, \nare signs of a vibrant democracy enabling the people \nof Bhutan to exercise their will through the ballot box.\n\nWe know that democracy needs to go beyond \nelections. We will therefore continually work to \nstrengthen democratic institutions, the rule of law, an \nindependent judiciary, a vibrant civil society, an open \nand free media and, above all, a democratic culture that \nenables people to voice their aspirations and to live \nwith dignity, equality and prosperity. As we embark \non a new phase in our relatively young democracy, we \ndo so in full confidence that democracy in Bhutan is \nirreversible and on a firm footing. In this journey, we \ncount on the support of our friends and the international \ncommunity.\n\nWe meet at a time of extraordinary changes. While \nsome have been able to achieve tremendous economic \ngrowth and prosperity, millions of people continue \nto languish in the inhuman depths of poverty. Our \nrelentless drive for economic growth has come at the \ncost of our environment. The climate is changing. \nNatural disasters hit us with increasing frequency \nand intensity. The natural question then is, how do we \nadvance economic growth, promote societal progress \nand prosperity within the confines of nature? How do \nwe lift the millions of people out of the vicious circle of \npoverty? How can we ensure that we leave a planet safe \nand secure for our children and grandchildren?\n\nThese, I believe, are the key questions that confront \nus all. Although we come from different parts of the \nglobe, with our unique historical backgrounds and \ncultural experiences, we are bound by our shared future. \nIn today\u2019s interconnected and globalized world, we \ncan prevail only if we come together as global citizens \nand work to find solutions for the sake of our common \nfuture. In this endeavour, Mr. President, as you have \nrightly stated, failure is not an option.\n\nMy delegation welcomes the theme \u201cThe post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage\u201d for this general \ndebate. The question of the post-2015 development \nagenda is important, especially for the least developed \nand landlocked countries, which in many respects have \nthe most at stake. It presents the opportunity for all \ncountries to share their experiences and the kind of \ndevelopment agenda that they would like to see in the \npost-2015 era.\n\nAs we set the stage for a development agenda \nbeyond 2015, the Millennium Declaration (resolution \n52/2) provides a strong foundation. In our search for \na new development agenda we must not forget the \nimportant principles set out in the Declaration, but must \nemphasize their continued relevance. The Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) inspired nations and a \nwhole generation to improve the lives of many people by \ncreating synergies between nations and among people. \nAll efforts must be made to accelerate the realization of \nthe MDGs during their last mile.\n\nThe outcome document of the United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development (resolution \n66/288, annex) also outlined important principles on \nwhich the post-2015 development agenda should be \n\n\n\f\nbuilt. These principles must guide our efforts to come \nup with a holistic and transformative development \nagenda that puts people at the centre of development \nand brings about shared prosperity and happiness to \nall. Within this broader vision, poverty eradication \nmust form a central theme of the post-2015 agenda. For \nBhutan, the alleviation of poverty remains a challenge \nand features as a key priority in the current eleventh \nfive-year development plan.\n\nEqually important is the need to bring about \ninclusive development, which is one of the priority \nobjectives of the Royal Government of Bhutan. \nTargeted interventions are being planned to promote \nthe livelihoods of the poorest and most vulnerable \ncommunities in Bhutan.\n\nThe empowerment of women should constitute \none of the main building blocks of the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda. Any development agenda will fall \nshort if it does not include the empowerment of women \nas a key component.\n\nIssues related to youth and to providing gainful \nemployment to a growing population is one of the \ncritical challenges that my country continues to face. \nIt is therefore vitally important that the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda address the issues of youth, as \nthey are the key stakeholders of that era.\n\nI cannot overemphasize the importance of a \nstrong means of implementation in the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda. Without it, the capacity of \ndeveloping and least developed countries to realize the \npost-2015 development priorities will remain severely \nchallenged. At the intergovernmental level, Bhutan \nwill continue its close engagement in the work of the \nOpen Working Group on Sustainable Development \nGoals, on which it is pleased to serve as a member. We \nlook forward to contributing to the intergovernmental \nnegotiations towards the elaboration of a single post-\n2015 development agenda.\n\nThe subject of development inevitably leads me to \nrefer to my country\u2019s experience, in which it is guided \nby the development philosophy of Gross National \nHappiness, a vision that has given character to my \ncountry. Happiness and development have come to \nmean many things, and there are indeed many experts \nand a rich body of literature on the subject. This body \nalso adopted resolution 65/309, on happiness, at its \nsixty-fifth session, and resolution 66/281 proclaiming \n20 March as the International Day of Happiness, at its \nsixty-sixth session.\n\nHappiness as a development policy must relate to \nindividuals as well as to Governments. It is the sacred \nresponsibility of Governments to ensure that conditions \nare created for its citizens to pursue their individual \nhappiness within the larger aspirations of the country. \nAll our achievements, including the peaceful transition \nto a democracy in 2008, as well as the progress realized \nin achieving the Millennium Development Goals, have \nbeen as a result of embarking on a people-centred \ndevelopment approach.\n\nEncouraged by our positive national experience, \nBhutan has facilitated efforts to elaborate a holistic \napproach to development. We intend to share the \nfindings with Member States and the wider international \ncommunity at an appropriate time. We hope that this \nmodest contribution will serve as a useful input to the \nongoing discussions on the post-2015 development \nagenda.\n\nWhile Bhutan has made significant socioeconomic \nprogress, we face many challenges and vulnerabilities, \nbeing both a landlocked and a least developed country. \nOur economy remains import-driven and dependent \non a single export commodity. Poverty, youth \nunemployment, natural disasters and vulnerability to \nadverse impacts of climate change, including glacial \nlake outburst floods, pose challenges. We will therefore \ncontinue to count on external support and assistance as \nwe work towards achieving our long-cherished goal of \nself-reliance and graduation from the least developed \ncountry category.\n\nWe recognize that a vibrant democracy should be \nbuilt on a strong economy, which is essential to bring \nabout improvement in the lives of the people. Therefore, \nin the eleventh Five-Year Development Plan, the main \nthrust will be to promote prosperity for all through \ninclusive social development, accelerated green \neconomic development and infrastructure development.\n\nThe United Nations, with its global scope and \nmandate, remains the only universal organization that \ncan forge a global coordinated response to the pressing \nchallenges in areas ranging from peace and security to \ndevelopment. The challenges of our times are, however, \ntesting the United Nations and the resolve of its Member \nStates to work together. Every effort must be made to \nstrengthen the role and efficacy of a United Nations that \nis just, democratic and representative and allows space \n\n\n\f\nfor its Members, including the smallest, to participate \nfully in its work. That is the key to the legitimacy of an \neffective multilateral system.\n\nWe remain hopeful that under your able leadership, \nSir, the sixty-eighth session will further advance work \non the reform of the United Nations. The General \nAssembly must be revitalized and its role strengthened. \nThe membership of the Security Council in both the \npermanent and the non-permanent categories must \nbe expanded to bring it into line with contemporary \nrealities and to make the Council a more representative \nbody.\n\nThese are challenging times indeed. It falls upon \nus to seek the wisdom of those who created this great \ninstitution to work together in the spirit of international \ncooperation in solving international problems. We have \nthe opportunity not only to strengthen the role of the \nUnited Nations and advance multilateralism, but also to \ndefine a holistic development agenda that will respond \nto the universal aspiration for happiness.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf \nof my country, Tunisia, and the Tunisian people, \nI greet the Assembly and all those around the world \nrepresented here.\n\nOn 17 December 2010, Tunisia, as the Assembly \nknows, was the first country to experience the Arab \nSpring, the peaceful revolutions of Arab peoples \naimed at ridding themselves of corrupt dictatorships \nhampering the economic, political and social progress \nof their countries. Such dictatorships had imposed with \nbrutal force corrupt regimes that had swept away basic \nhuman civilization. What has now been seen in some \nArab Spring countries may lead some to believe that \nthose efforts at liberation have failed and that the dream \nhas become a nightmare.\n\nWhat we must remember is that the Arab Spring \nis not a final stage, something that can be achieved \novernight. It is, rather, just the beginning of a liberation \njourney and a future project leading towards further \nhorizons. What we must take into consideration is the \nelement of time. Nations require decades to gain control \nof their revolutions and achieve their success or failure. \nWe must remember that the Arab Spring, like all human \nprojects, may stumble or come to a standstill \u2014 indeed, \nmay fail. Our duty \u2014 the duty of those here \u2014 is to \npersist in support of that journey and to begin afresh \nafter each obstacle. \n\nWe believe that the difficulties involved in \nbuilding democracy in the Arab Spring countries are \nonly natural and will be overcome. Our peoples will \nnever accept regimes that shackle them. We want \nto fight extremism cloaked in religion, not replace it \nwith dictatorship cloaked in nationalism or patriotism. \nThose difficulties do indeed reveal that political, social \nand ideological forces are pushing countries this way \nand that; building democracy and civil institutions is \nreplete with difficulties in all Arab Spring countries.\n\nFrom this rostrum, I would like to speak to the \ncurrent authorities in Egypt and call on them to release \nPresident Mohammed Morsi and all political detainees. \nOnly a bold initiative such as that has the potential to \nend the political tensions, stop the violence and bring \nall the parties back to a dialogue as the only means to \nsolve all the difficult problems caused by the current \ntransitional phase.\n\nThe restriction of movement of goods and persons is \nincreasing the difficulties faced by the struggling people \nof Gaza under Israeli occupation and colonization.\n\nTunisia is dealing with three challenges. That \nof terrorism, as exemplified by the killing of the two \nmartyrs, Shukri Belaid on 6 February and Mohamed \nBrahimi on 25 July, is a major political challenge that \nhas impeded the work on the Constitutional Council. \nThe second is the fact of slowing domestic and foreign \ninvestment. The third is that we are having to learn \ndemocracy at the same time that we are building and \ndefending it. It has not yet taken root in our political \nand social traditions or our general culture. In \nTunisia we have many of the elements necessary for \nsuccess \u2014 a responsible and conscious political class \nthat has continued to pursue dialogue, a legitimate, \ndisciplined and professional army and a people who \nare peaceful and politically aware and who understand \nwhat is in their own interests.\n\nI would like to assure the Assembly that the Arab \nSpring in Tunisia will continue and succeed. We \n\n\n\f\nwill set a date for elections and will agree on a just \nGovernment. Those elections will be supervised by the \nUnited Nations, the League of Arab States, the African \nUnion and all other relevant international and local \norganizations and civil society groups. God willing, \nthey will be held next spring. We are aware that the \nforces of terrorism and chaos will try to destabilize \nthem as much as possible. Tunisia is undertaking this \nexperiment both for itself and for the rest of the world. \n\nWe want our revolution to be peaceful. We want \njustice to play its role in the transitional period. We \nalso want to expand the concept of democracy. It is \nnot merely about the rights of those winning 51 per \ncent of the vote, and ignoring those who won 49 per \ncent. We want coalition Governments that take into \nconsideration the fact that society is made up of many \nparts. We want to learn from one another. Our success \nor failure will have consequences that will reach far \nbeyond our borders. Hence the importance of solidarity \namong peoples, so that we can ensure success for this \nunique experiment.\n\nToday the Arab Spring has encountered the ultimate \nexpression of suffering in Syria. The violence that has \nfaced peaceful demonstrations has shocked us from the \nbeginning. It is escalating day after day, and is now brutal \non a scale that history has seldom seen before. In Tunisia \nwe have taken a strong position against the dictatorship \nin Syria. We supported the the struggle of the Syrian \nopposition and expelled the regime\u2019s ambassador from \nour country. We have been warning for a long time now \nabout the problems of the militarization of the events, \nof factionalism, sectarianism and outside intervention, \nwhether by States or so-called jihadi groups, including \nsome from Tunisia, which we know will be a danger to \nus when they return from that suffering country.\n\nWe have always called for a peaceful solution and \nhave gone so far as to say that life is more important \nthan justice, and if it is necessary not to prosecute the \nSyrian dictators \u2014 and if they leave the scene \u2014 we \nshould accept that situation, however bitter. Our fears \nhave become reality, however, and we continue to \nlive with this nightmare that is afflicting the valiant \nSyrian people, as well as our conscience. We have \nnever seen such a pitch of brutality and barbarity. A \npolitical solution to end the nightmare is desperately \nneeded. However, what we also need is the support of \nthe General Assembly for prosecuting the case through \nthe International Criminal Court (ICC). That would be \na contribution to international law that could contribute \nto protecting people against dictatorships, particularly \nthe Syrian dictatorship, which is an extreme example of \nhow immorally a regime can behave.\n\nWe are fully confident that had the Court been able \nto act, the Syrian regime would not have attempted to \nturn the presidency of the country into rule-by-heredity, \nlimiting ruling to one party only. It would not have \ndared to convict members of opposition political parties \nand sentence them to death. Imagine if the Court had \nbeen able to act in such cases. What if the Court had \nbeen able to pursue a course in favour of human rights? \nImagine how we could have avoided the nightmare that \nthe Syrian people has been going through \u2014 100,000 \ndead and 7 million displaced persons, with a regime \nkilling men, women and children with all the weapons \nat its disposal, including chemical weapons. \n\nHave we ever seen such a brutal regime by an \nindividual person who came to power through force \nand falsification and who is fighting a barbarous civil \nwar that has set the stage for ugly scenes beyond any \never seen in the history of the region? The regime ought \nto be brought to the ICC. Justice delayed still cannot \nbring millions of dead back to life. There have to be \npreventive bodies that can take up such situations from \ntheir very beginning. \n\nRegimes like that of Syria cannot last long \nagainst internal democratic opposition and the lack of \ninternational recognition. Tunisia therefore calls on all \ndemocratic States that wish to build institutions that \ncounter the rise of dictatorships to support our project. \nWe believe that such a constitutional court would be the \nexpression of a new spirit needed by the international \ncommunity.\n\nWe are meeting in this place with all the nations \nof the world to review the world\u2019s problems, many of \nwhich are foreseeable and bring great pain to people. \nWe would have been able to avoid such situations had \nwe adopted the slogan \u201cThink globally and act locally.\u201d \n\nAs a medical doctor, I would recall that we were \nable to conquer epidemics that raged against humankind \nthrough efforts at prevention. Dictatorships, climate \nchange and poverty must be thwarted internally and \namong peoples. In facing such epidemics, we must have \npreventive policies that save humankind. We hope to \nGod that there is enough time for us to quickly take \nsuch a direction before it is too late.\n"

        "file_text": "May I first congratulate Mr. John \nAshe on his election to the presidency at the current \nsession. I am sure that his wisdom and experience will \nguide our deliberations on the many challenges that \nthe world faces today. Also, allow me to commend His \nExcellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi. for his excellent leadership \nduring the sixty-seventh session.\n\nThe President knows better than most the unique \ncombination of challenges faced by small island \ndeveloping States. We are being battered from all sides, \nboth literally and figuratively. Over the past decade, we \nhave faced a flood of crises with a genesis far from our \nshores that have stretched our capacity to protect and \nimprove the health and prosperity of our people.\n\nThe near collapse of the global financial system \nand spikes in food and energy prices have caused \nenormous difficulties for our small and vulnerable \neconomy. A severe drought caused additional hardship \nand foreshadowed the much more difficult future we \nwill face in a warming world. At the same time, the \nflow of official development assistance and climate \nfinancing have begun to stagnate.\n\nThankfully, we are presented with an unprecedented \nopportunity over the next few years to transform \nhow the international system supports sustainable \ndevelopment. We will be continuing work on a number \nof important processes over the next year., They include \nthe crafting of sustainable development goals and the \npost-2015 development agenda, the work of the High-\nlevel Political Forum on Sustainable Development \nand \u2014 of particular importance to my country \u2014 the \nproceedings of the third Global Conference on the \nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing \nStates. In addition, we must make rapid progress \ntowards a new climate-change agreement in 2015, \nwhich will obviously have enormous implications for \nthe sustainable development prospects of small islands. \nWe must work in a coordinated fashion so that those \nprocesses are mutually reinforcing and deliver concrete \nresults, rather than produce the usual rhetoric. It will be \na challenge, but under the President\u2019s skilled leadership, \nI am confident we can succeed.\n\nHowever, I fear we will come up short of our \nambitions for transformational change if we shy away \nfrom making fundamental reforms in the way the global \neconomy works. We began a promising conversation \non the matter back in 2008 when the financial crisis \nwas still fresh in our minds, but as stock prices have \nrebounded, our attention has wandered. Let us not \nforget that most of the problems that caused the previous \ncrisis have not been fixed. Those same problems also \n\n\n\f\nundermine sustainable development in many countries \nand communities around the world.\n\nIn 2009, the Commission of Experts on Reforms \nof the International Monetary and Financial System \nsubmitted a report (A/63/838) to this body in which it \nindicated that finance, which should be the servant of \nthe economy, had been promoted to be its master. The \nrules of economic governance had been increasingly \nwritten to serve the interests of a shrinking few as they \npursued risky ventures \u2014 ventures that often played \nhavoc with people\u2019s lives and livelihoods. We are \nvery familiar with some of the results of that system: \nstock-market bubbles, currency bubbles and property \nbubbles. When they burst, they leave behind enormous \nhardship. Even worse, investments in risky activities of \nthat type compete with more productive investments in \nbasic infrastructure, renewable energy, health services \nand the like \u2014 investments that contribute to true \nsustainable development.\n\nOur reckless inaction is demonstrated by the \ninflation of the latest bubble: the carbon bubble. At \nleast two thirds of known fossil fuel reserves cannot be \nburned if we are to limit the rise in global temperatures \nto below two degrees. The cost of renewable energy has \nfallen considerably in the past decade. By any measure, \nfossil fuels are a very bad long-term investment, yet \nthat has not prevented trillions of dollars in private \ninvestment and fossil fuel subsidies from pouring into \nnew infrastructure for the exploration, extraction and \nconsumption of fossil fuels.\n\nThe size of the recent housing bubble has been \nestimated at $4 trillion. The carbon bubble could be \nmore than five times larger. That should be an issue of \nserious international concern. How do we allow trillions \nof dollars to flow into destructive activities while the \nmost basic needs of millions go unmet? The reasons are \ncomplicated, but make no mistake that this is a choice. \nIt is a choice made by international policymakers to \nprioritize profits over people.\n\nAs the President said earlier this week, \u201cit is \ntime for us to concede that our efforts at reforming \nand revitalizing our Organization need new impetus\u201d \n(A/68/PV.5, p. 5). Reclaiming the global economic \nsystem and putting it to work for the good of the people \nwill be a long and difficult process, but it may be the \nonly way to reach our sustainable development goals.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s 2009 report made many good \nrecommendations for our consideration, and the first \nstep must be to bring more transparency and democratic \noversight to economic governance. The most important \ndecisions are not made in universal bodies, such as the \nGeneral Assembly, but rather far away from the small, \nthe isolated and the vulnerable. Is it any surprise that \nthe system has failed to meet our needs?To address that \nproblem, we should start by relaunching the discussion \non global economic governance here in the General \nAssembly, as well as by reforming the governance of \nthe Bretton Woods institutions, so that they are more \ninclusive.\n\nThe systemic barriers to sustainable development \nare formidable, but that has not stopped Nauru \nfrom seeking practical solutions that can be readily \nimplemented in the short term. An example is the \nrecently completed Nauru case study on climate change \nfinancing. The study identified a number of steps my \nGovernment and our development partners can take to \nmake official development assistance more effective. \nFor example, project-based financing was found to be \nmarkedly less effective than more flexible modalities, \nsuch as general budgetary support.\n\nAnother key finding concerned the need for \ndomestic institution-building. Accessing many sources \nof multilateral finance is, quite frankly, beyond the \ncapacity of my Government, and the traditional \nstrategy of conducting regional workshops has simply \nnot worked. We hope to collaborate with development \npartners to design sustained programmes with a \nsignificant in-country component, so that there is a \ndurable transfer of the skills necessary to benefit from \ninternational support mechanisms.\n\nNauru has also made its best efforts to contribute at \nthe international level. We have the tremendous honour \nof presiding over the Alliance of Small Island States \n(AOSlS), a group that has been a leading advocate \nfor climate action for more than two decades. The \nupcoming nineteenth session of the Conference of the \nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change (COP-19), to be held in Warsaw, \nwill be important to laying the foundation for an \nambitious agreement in 2015. A key priority for the \nCOP-19 will be jump-starting near-term mitigation \naction through the launch of a process guided by more \ntechnical expertise and focused on energy efficiency \nand renewable energy. AOSIS has proposed a very \npractical and collaborative approach to rapidly scale \nup the implementation of policies and the deployment \nof technologies that not only reduce greenhouse gas \n\n\n\f\nemissions but also advance domestic sustainable \ndevelopment priorities. In the view of AOSIS, that \ntechnical process can prepare the ground for a much \nmore ambitious post-2020 agreement.\n\nThe proposal in no way relieves developed \ncountries of their international obligation to take the \nlead in addressing climate change. They should be held \naccountable for fully implementing best practices to \nreduce their own emissions, while also providing the \nmeans for implementing adaptation and mitigation \nactions in developing countries. The AOSlS proposal \nindicates the way to accomplish those objectives. \nEstablishing an international mechanism to address \nloss and damage is also a key priority for AOSlS, as is \nmobilizing climate financing and making sure the Green \nClimate Fund is ready to accept donor contributions in \n2014.\n\nClimate change is the greatest challenge to the \nsustainable development of small islands. We must \ncome to terms with the fact that, owing to our delay, \nsome grave impacts are now unavoidable. Some will \nhave security implications. Addressing the security \nimplications of climate change remains a key priority \nfor Nauru and the Pacific small island developing \nStates. I would like to reiterate our proposals for \nmoving forward.\n\nFirst, we are calling for the appointment of a \nspecial representative on climate and security to help \nexpand our understanding of the security dimensions \nof climate change. The special representative would \nregularly report to the General Assembly and the \nSecurity Council on emerging climate-related security \nthreats and would facilitate regional cooperation on \ncross-border issues. Vulnerable developing countries in \nparticular could benefit from a special representative \nequipped to help them evaluate their security situations \nand develop action plans to increase the resilience \nof their institutions. At some point in the future, the \nspecial representative could become an invaluable \nasset in preventive diplomacy efforts and post-conflict \nsituations.\n\nSecondly, we are requesting the Secretary-General \nto lead a joint task force of all the relevant organs and \nspecialized agencies to immediately assess the capacity \nand resources of the United Nations system to respond \nto the anticipated security implications of climate \nchange. We have heard in countless forums about the \npotentially destabilizing effects of climate change, yet \nwe have only the vaguest idea of what an international \nresponse to those effects would look like. That needs to \nchange. We must start preparing for the challenges that \nlie ahead. As the Secretary-General said at the High-\nlevel Political Forum on Sustainable Development, \n\u201cWe must strengthen the interface between science and \npolicy\u201d. \n\nThe world\u2019s attention is now focused on the \nimmense suffering in Syria. On behalf of the people \nof Nauru, I would like to offer my condolences to the \nmillions of people whose lives have been affected by \nthe Syrian conflict. We are horrified by the scale of \nhuman atrocity there. I am compelled to ask: Do we \nalways have to wait for well over 100,000 people to \nbe killed before we can find solutions to restore peace \nand security? As the President observed, the mandate \nof this body has limitations, and we cannot issue \nresolutions that bind countries. The United Nations \ninvests enormous power in the hands of a tiny minority \nof five, which is not so different from global economic \ngovernance being dictated primarily by eight.\n\nNauru is always striving to improve bilateral \nrelations. I would like to express my gratitude to \nAustralia, which has always been an important partner.\nWe look forward to our continued work with the new \nGovernment as we continue to collaborate on joint \nprojects that are delivering important benefits in my \ncountry.\n\nNauru is gratified to note that, with solid \ninternational support and cross-Strait rapprochement, \nthe Republic of China on Taiwan has increased its \nmeaningful participation in United Nations specialized \nagencies and mechanisms. We continue to encourage \nthe positive interaction between the two sides of the \nTaiwan Strait in the international arena. Furthermore, \nI would like to recognize the contributions that Taiwan \nhas made to helping my country make progress towards \nthe Millennium Development Goals. We also express \nour gratitude to the Governments of New Zealand, the \nRussian Federation, Japan, the Republic of Korea and \nIndia; they are all invaluable partners in our joint effort \nto bring sustainable development to my island.\n\nAs the President of the General Assembly aptly \ndescribed in his opening statement, setting the stage \nfor sustainable development will require introspection, \nfrank discussion and coming to terms with some hard \ntruths about the nature of the challenges we face and \nthe institutions we have at hand to respond. Only by \n\n\n\f\ncorrectly diagnosing the problems and choosing the \nappropriate tools to begin our work will we be able to \nreach satisfactory outcomes that benefit us all. \n"

        "file_text": "We are living in times of rapid \nchange. Global and regional dynamics are transforming \nglobal governance. A changing world will inevitably \nchange the United Nations. But we, the Members of this \ngreat Organization, can influence the direction of the \nchange. In order to do so, however, we must set strategic \npriorities. We should develop an agile multilateral \nsystem for the twenty-first century.\n\nThe architects of the United Nations were in many \nways ahead of their time. The Charter, in its Chapters \nVI and VIII, foresaw a world where the United Nations \nshould safeguard international peace and security, the \nsettlement of disputes and the promotion of common \ninterests at the regional, as much as at the global, level. \nBy 1945, however, there were few established regional \nmechanisms. In other words, the Charter\u2019s provisions \nfor regional arrangements were largely aspirational.\n\nIn today\u2019s world, regional organizations and \narrangements are increasingly proving their relevance. \nEconomic, social and political integration is taking \nplace at the regional level. Cooperation is not only \nabout outcomes, but also about processes. Practical \ncooperation can lay the foundation for strategic trust \nand shared values. \n\n\n\f\nIt was only after the past century\u2019s two horrific \nwars that my own continent chose close integration. \nThat was instrumental in the creation of a peaceful \nEurope. For that historic achievement, the European \nUnion was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo last \nyear. \n\nThe African Union (AU) has seen its continent \nthrough 50 transformative years. Freedom came at a \nhigh price. Yet, Africa has never been more prosperous \nthan it is today. We see economic growth, improving \ngovernance and enhanced regional cooperation.\n\nFrom Somalia to Mali, the African Union and its \nsubregional partners continue to prove their relevance. \nThe African Union is, beyond doubt, becoming one of \nthe United Nations most important regional partners. I \ncommend the AU for its dedicated efforts, and I want \nto express my deepest condolences for the tragic loss \nof life in the heinous terrorist attacks in Nairobi. We \nmust never allow terrorists to set the agenda. Hence \nour efforts to work with the AU to promote peace and \nstability in Somalia at this crucial moment must be \nredoubled.\n\nIn recent years, Norway has worked with the people \nof Colombia to lay the foundations for lasting peace \nbetween its Government and the Fuerzas Armadas \nRevolucionarias de Colombia movement. In doing so, \nwe have seen the strong commitment of Colombia\u2019s \nneighbours. There, as everywhere else, we have learned \nthat peace cannot just be established within one country \nalone; it has to be rooted in a regional context.\n\nIn South-East Asia, the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) is becoming the source, as \nwell as an architect, of regional stability. I commend \nASEAN for its constructive role in supporting the \ndemocratic reform process in Myanmar. Myanmar will \neven preside over ASEAN next year, which in many \nways is a testimony to the organization\u2019s adaptability.\n\nOrganizations such as ASEAN have also taken \nupon themselves the development of multilateral \nresponses to regional challenges, including those \npertaining to maritime security. Those strides are not \nonly of regional importance, but are important to us all. \nThe freedom and safety of the seas is one of the most \nimportant public goods in an interconnected world. \n\nJust like in South-East Asia, Norway and our \nfellow Arctic States have built our deepened maritime \ncooperation on one of the most salient organizing \nprinciples of the United Nations \u2014 the United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea. And regions reach \nout to each other. Earlier this year, Norway acceded \nto the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast \nAsia. Likewise, again during the spring, China, \nJapan, India, the Republic of Korea and Singapore \nall joined the Arctic Council as observers. In doing \nso, they subscribed to the founding principles of the \nArctic Council, principles that, yet again, are a direct \nreflection of a key a United Nations norm.\n\nWhere I live, we observe global warming at close \nquarters. As the polar ice cap melts, we are reminded of \nour shared responsibility for saving the planet\u2019s climate. \nToday, the Arctic Ocean is opening up to human \nactivities in ways hard to imagine only a few years \nago. Over the past decade, we have strived to develop \nforward-looking strategies for the safe management of \nthe new maritime crossroads between Asia, Europe and \nNorth America. \n\nThe emergence of regional institutions as a feature \nof global governance is in fact good news for the United \nNations. We need a United Nations that can be a catalyst \nthat supports and encourages regional developments, \nwhich \u2014 and as long as \u2014 they reinforce our common \nglobal and multilateral agenda. We must acknowledge \nthat trend. We must revisit the Charter of the United \nNations, in particular its Chapters VI and VIII, and \nseek to identify the opportunities and potential pitfalls \nit represents for the United Nations. \n\nThe Middle East has yet to find an effective regional \narchitecture. It is also a part of the world that is causing \nconsiderable concern these days. Israel and Palestine \nare facing a moment of truth. This month marks 20 \nyears since the signing of the Oslo Accords. We have \nwitnessed positive achievements on the ground. State \ninstitutions have been built and are ready for statehood. \nBut for many years, a political horizon has been missing. \nTime is running out for a negotiated two-State solution.\n\nBut now, as Palestinian and Israeli leaders have \nreturned to negotiations, hope is renewed. This \nafternoon, in the Conference Building, I presided \nover a meeting of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee \nfor the Coordination of the International Assistance \nto Palestinians, the international donor group for \nPalestine. The donors reaffirmed their commitment \nto providing necessary assistance to the Palestinian \nAuthority through the current transition to statehood. \n\n\n\f\nThis may be the last chance \u2014 a chance we cannot \nafford to miss.\n\nAs we speak the horrors in Syria are continuing. \nThousands upon thousands of children, women and \nmen are being killed and maimed. Millions are fleeing \ntheir homes. The use of chemical weapons is utterly \nunacceptable and is a grave violation of international \nlaw. Their further use must be effectively prevented. \nThose responsible must be brought to justice and the \ncase referred to the International Criminal Court. \n\nThe Syrian crisis as such can be resolved only \nthrough a political solution. The Security Council must \nnow live up to the responsibility that we, the Members \nof the United Nations, have entrusted in it. We must \nseize the momentum created by the United States-\nRussian agreement. Humanitarian access must be \nensured by all parties and to all areas. The bloodshed in \nSyria must come to an end.\n\nFrustrated by Syria, many have criticized the United \nNations for its inability to act. However, we should not \nlose sight of the United Nations many achievements. \nEvery single day, the United Nations provides shelter \nfor refugees, vaccinates children, promotes maternal \nhealth and stabilizes fragile States. Evolving norms \nof human security have placed new issues on the \nagenda. Children and armed conflict, women, peace \nand security and the protection of civilians are recent \nexamples of the important normative role of the United \nNations.\n\nFaced with a scarcity of resources accentuated by \na global economy under pressure, we should increase, \nnot decrease, the flexibility of the Secretariat and \nthe Secretary-General to run the Organization. In \nautumn of 2012, the Assembly decided that the 2014-\n2015 budget should be cut by $100 million. Reducing \nthe budget while increasing the number of tasks is a \nrecipe for a weaker, not a stronger, United Nations. The \nAssembly must be coherent in its policies. The role of \nthe Assembly should be to provide guidance, not to \nmicromanage.\n\nIn conclusion, to meet the regional and global \nchallenges of our time, we, the Member States, must \nwork together to fulfil the aspirations and potential of \nthe Charter of the United Nations. The efficiency of this \ngreat Organization depends upon its ability to innovate \nand to adapt to changing circumstances. \n"

        "file_text": "It is a great pleasure for me to have \nthis opportunity to join my fellow Heads of State and \nGovernment at the sixty-eighth session of the General \nAssembly. We wish to offer our profound congratulations \nand support to the President of the Assembly. We also \nwish to express the Kingdom\u2019s sincere appreciation to \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his entire staff \nfor their efforts and the role they continue to play in \nimproving the working mechanisms of the United \nNations and for being such a good host.\n\nThe United Nations has brought hope to those who \nare suffering, which is one of the pillars of its Charter. \nThe fundamental purpose of the United Nations is to \npromote tolerance among humankind so that nations \ncan live together in peace with one another. We are \npleased that the United Nations has always worked \nhard to promote and maintain international security, \nand it has further taken positive action to prevent and \nremove threats to the peace that humankind so desires. \nWe are also cognizant of the fact that humankind is \nfacing a test of unprecedented proportions in hotspots \nthat continue to pose a huge challenge for the United \nNations to address.\n\nWe have been deeply saddened by the senseless \nkilling of innocent people that took place this week \nin Nairobi. We condemn such acts of terrorism in \nthe strongest terms. We send words of comfort to the \nGovernment and the families who lost loved ones \nthrough that tragic and senseless violence. The world \nneeds to stand together and wipe terrorism from the \n\n\n\f\nface of the universe. We call upon those who support \nsuch activities to cease from doing so forthwith.\n\nWe are also extremely disturbed by the deadly \nconflicts in countries such as Syria, where innocent \npeople including women and children, are dying on \nboth sides, with some displaced now living as refugees \nin other countries. We encourage all of the people of \nSyria to immediately cease fire and use dialogue as a \nmeans of solving their differences, because using the \nbarrel of a gun to settle a score will not help them; \ninstead, it will leave the Syrian people divided and not \nseeing eye to eye. Infrastructure and social services \nwill be destroyed, leaving increased problems that will \nhave devastating effects for a very long time to come. \nWe trust they will soon find a peaceful resolution to \ntheir crisis. \n\nThe findings of the United Nations mission on the \nuse of chemical weapons in Syria should be used as a \nbasis to chart a way forward in pursuit of the dismantling \nof these unconventional weapons of mass destruction, \nwhich pose a serious threat to humankind. As long as \nchemical weapons continue to exist in that country, it \nremains at risk of similar attacks, where nobody will \nown up to them. Therefore, it is only proper that the \ndismantling process begin with immediate effect to \nprevent a similar attack in the future.\n\nIt is important that whatever action takes place in \nSyria, it must fall within the mandate of the United \nNations. The United Nations must act quickly on those \nissues and take a leading role in making sure that those \nepisodes where life is lost through the use of such \nweapons are prevented.\n\nIt is important for leaders and Governments to \nmaintain contact and be in constant consultation with \ntheir people at all times to avoid situations where leaders \ndo not understand the aspirations of their people. It is \nimperative to create forums where people will have \naccess to Government to express themselves, because \na lack of such communication and detachment leads to \neither Governments or the people reacting in a violent \nmanner towards the other.\n\nThe domino effect of such situations can lead to \nan international crisis, as the problems of one country \ncan easily spiral into problems for others, which may \nneed to intervene. Such strife causes countries, as well \nas the United Nations, to divert resources from the \nobjectives of socioeconomic development and channel \nthem towards financing conflict situations instead of \nthe welfare of the people.\n\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini is committed to a \nprocess of consultation with the people at the People\u2019s \nParliament \u2014 Sibaya \u2014 and other dialogue forums. \nThat practice is democratic and participatory in \nthat everybody is involved in key decision-making \nprocesses.\n\nBefore I came to attend the General Assembly, \nthe Kingdom of eSwatini held a very successful and \npeaceful election, which proved to be one of the most \nsuccessful we have had over the years. Some 40 per cent \nof the Swaziland population were eligible to vote, and \n70 per cent of them registered to do so in the elections. \nThe primary and secondary elections were also very \npeaceful, free and fair, without any undue influence.\n\nIn the past, there had been only one day of voting, \nbut this year we had to extend voting for two days \nduring the primary and secondary elections. Our \nelections embrace our traditions and culture, whereby \npeople from communities nominate people in their \nchiefdoms to compete at constituency level, which \nwe call Tinkhundla. The winners then go straight to \nParliament as a direct representation.\n\nAs a result, the people are happy to be part of \nthe Government formulation process, because they \ncan claim ownership of the people who constitute the \nGovernment of the day. It is in that vein that we trust \nthat the new parliamentarians will work very well with \nthe people in shaping the future of the Kingdom of \neSwatini, with a view to meeting their aspirations and \nattaining the objectives of the Millennium Development \nGoals.\n\nWe also note with interest the increased number \nof observers in this year\u2019s election. Regional and \ninternational observers were highly impressed with our \nelections. We therefore call upon the world to embrace \nour system.\n\nWe are aware of the fact that many countries do \nnot understand how our system of government works. \nWe are happy to define our system as a monarchial \ndemocracy. Monarchial democracy is defined as a \nmarriage between the monarchy and the ballot box. \nThe ballot box represents the will of the people. The \npeople provide advice and counsel to the King, and \nthat ensures transparency and accountability. It is a \ncombination of power and empowerment. It means that \n\n\n\f\nthe monarchy of eSwatini guarantees the continuity of \nstability, and the democracy of eSwatini guarantees the \nshared power of the people.\n\nTherefore, the monarchy is married to the trust of \nthe people, who believe that the King does everything \nin their best interests. It is home-grown; it easily \naccords with the norms and values of the Swazis and is \ntherefore easily understood by all Swazis.\n\nTo those who proclaim that democracy is the \nanswer to all nations and their development, we present \nourselves as testimony of a new democratic ideology \nthat works. It has a place in modern-day democracy, \nand it complies with all structures of the United \nNations family. The Kingdom of eSwatini is committed \nto the ideals of the United Nations just as much as it \nis dedicated to protecting its history, its legacy and \nits dignity, while at the same time embracing the \nopportunities and possibilities for cooperation within \nthe community of nations.\n\nIt is therefore the Kingdom of eSwatini\u2019s position \nthat it believes in democracy as an idea, but not as an \nideal, because things that are ideal to some may not be \nideal to others. The Kingdom of eSwatini will, however, \ncontinue to embrace the opportunities, the technologies \nand the mechanisms that create a modern society.\n\nOur ultimate goal is to have achieved first-world \nstatus by 2022, or at least visible signs that we are \nheading in that direction socially, economically and \notherwise. In the past five years, significant progress \nhas been made in the Kingdom towards poverty \neradication, improving the health of our people, and \ninfrastructure and agricultural development. We are \nconfident that we will see much more progress in the \nnext few years.\n\nThe kingdom of eSwatini has been implementing \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which \nbecame effective in 2000 and most of which have a target \ndate of 2015. Good progress has been made in the areas \nof education, gender, the empowerment of women and \nmalaria control. Although the country has implemented \na number of initiatives aimed at addressing the other \nMillennium Goals, there is still a need to accelerate \nefforts to address the issues of poverty, HIV and AIDS, \ninfant mortality and maternal health.\n\nIn order to solicit views on the post-2015 development \nagenda, the Kingdom of eSwatini embarked on an \nintensive consultative process. It involved a cross- \nspectrum of stakeholders, including traditional leaders, \nyoung people, women, men, the business community, \npeople with disabilities, faith-based organizations, civil \nsociety organizations and different regiments.\n\nOn the goal of eradicating poverty, the nation \nagreed that poverty was still a challenge and that \ngreater efforts were needed to address it. The poor \nperformance of the economy in recent years due to the \nglobal financial crisis has contributed to the situation, \nand therefore a great deal still needs to be done in that \nregard.\n\nAs to providing quality education and lifelong \nlearning, the country has made significant progress \ntowards achieving universal primary education. \nHowever, there is a need to focus, with the support of \nthe private sector, on the quality of education and to \nintroduce more vocational skills.\n\nThe Government has invested significantly in the \nhealth sector. However, the burden of disease continues \nto exist; hence that goal remains very relevant for the \npeople of eSwatini. The country is still faced with \nthe problem of HIV/AIDS, and therefore, in the post-\n2015 development agenda, the pressure to address the \nscourge as well as other, non-communicable diseases \nshould be maintained.\n\nEnsuring food security and good nutrition remains \na priority and should feature prominently in the post-\n2015 development agenda. However, the issue of \nclimate change continues to be a drawback to many \nof our developing countries. Our food production has \nbeen seriously affected by climate-change patterns and \nthe related challenges.\n\nThe provision of adequate financial resources and \nthe transfer of environmentally sound technologies and \ntechnical assistance to developing countries are critical \nif we are to achieve our global objectives. We therefore \nappeal to our developed partners to honour the pledges \nthey have made to the Green Fund and the sustainable \ndevelopment programme as a matter of priority. We \nstrongly believe that this could add the required \nimpetus in the context of our objective of increasing \nfood production.\n\nThe goal of achieving universal access to water and \nsanitation is also important for the people of eSwatini, \nsince water is a very basic requirement for agricultural \nand industrial production, as well as for domestic use. \nRemarkable progress has been made in the area of \nsupplying potable water to households; coverage has \nreached 71 per cent nationally. \n\n\n\f\nThe creation of jobs, sustainable livelihoods and \nequitable growth is critical for the development of any \ncountry and is linked to the goal of ending poverty. \nEmphasis should be put on value addition, technology \ntransfer and the development of entrepreneurial skills, \nparticularly for young people. As a country, Swaziland \nis fully behind the post-2015 agenda, because it remains \na guideline for the international community in working \ntogether for the sustainable development of our \nrespective countries.\n\nThe issue of the reform of the Security Council \nremains a top priority for the African continent. We are \ncalling for a Council that will give equal opportunities \nto all regions of the world to voice their opinions as \nan international family on issues regarding global \nconflict. We believe our proposal is just and fair so that \nas a region Africa can have a voice in the affairs of the \nCouncil as equal partners in this global Organization.\n\nThe United Nations should continue to play its \nadvocacy role to ensure humankind continues to live \npeacefully with each other. All nations around the \nworld should be given equal opportunities to share their \nexpertise and experiences with the Organization.\n\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini is happy to note that, \nwith solid international support and cross-Strait \ndevelopments, the Republic of China on Taiwan has \nincreased its meaningful participation in United \nNations specialized agencies and mechanisms. We \nwill continue to encourage positive interaction in the \ninternational arena between the two sides of the Taiwan \nStrait. \n\nFinally, I hope that this session will come up \nwith the desired results and tangible targets. We also \nlook forward to a post-2015 agenda that will create a \nconducive landscape for all humankind to live in.\n"

        "file_text": "I am the newly elected Prime \nMinister of Albania. This is my first month in office. \nIt is truly humbling to stand at this rostrum in the \nsteps and the shadows of some of the great figures of \nhistory who have stood here and shaped our world, in \nthis forum, which, for all the criticisms of the United \nNations, is a living reminder that good must come from \nbad and that the march of progress through time is \npowered by debate, ideas, cooperation, argument and \nagreement.\n\nAlbania is no great Power; it is a small country, but \nwith great potential. It has outstanding natural beauty \nand good and hard-working people. My challenge is to \n\n\n\f\nbring change so that this potential can be fulfilled. It will \ntake time. It will take a lot of effort and perseverance. \nIt will take understanding and support from friends and \npartners. For my part, I will add leadership. We have a \nlong way to go, but it can be done.\n\nI was reading a study recently that analysed every \ncountry in the world, measuring the positive and \nnegative media coverage. Switzerland was at the top; \nAlbania was 161st. In truth, people around the world \nmay not know that much about Albania, but what they \nthink they know is not good. The film industry has not \nbeen kind to us \u2014 Wag The Dog, Taken, Taken 2. Even \nI was a bit scared to be in Albania after that. I hope one \nday Liam Neeson, Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro \ncan visit and see what a beautiful country it is and feel \nthe potential that I feel.\n\nBut I am not naive. Our problems are not all based \nin Hollywood. Some are real and damaging, such as \ncorruption, which scars countries in the way the swish \nof a blade can scar a beautiful face. It deters legitimate \ninvestors from investing. It holds back progress. It \nstops people from believing there can ever be fairness. \nCorruption can and must be beaten if we are to build the \neconomic rule of law we need, get the investment we \nneed and attract the tourism that our scenery, heritage \nand warm, welcoming people deserve. It will not be \neasy, but it can be done, and we are fully committed.\n\nThe world has changed tremendously in the course \nof recent decades, and it is changing now at an even \nfaster pace. We all expect the United Nations to follow \nsuit. United Nations reform is not only necessary; it has \nbecome imperative. If we fail to agree and act on that, \nthe role which the United Nations is to play will remain \nincomplete.\n\nOne of the important aspects of change is the \nongoing reform of the delivery of development \nassistance. In the course of a few years, delivering \nas one has proved to be a valuable achievement, and \nit represents today an avenue for deeper reform. If we \nwant more effectiveness, better efficiency and coherent \naction by various United Nations actors and if we aim \nfor better results on the ground and better value for \nour money, delivering as one is the way to go. We have \npledged our support and will continue to do so as we \nare convinced that is the right path.\n \n\nThe United Nations is beyond any doubt one of \nthe most important world bodies. We joined it in the \nmiddle of the past century. But it is not alone; for us, \nthe European Union (EU), which represents the most \nimportant political project the world has known to date, \nis another. We aspire to join it. We know the changes \nwe have to make, and I am determined to make them.\n\nIf the EU has turned its attention towards our \nregion, particularly due to past conflicts, together \nwe \u2014 Albanians, Serbs, Montenegrins, Bosnians, \nMacedonians and all the other peoples of the region \nwho have already joined the European Union \u2014 should \nmaintain our eyes and our focus on the EU for projects \nrelated to our development for a better and more \nprosperous common future. \n\nRegional cooperation that is not grounded in \nstrategic projects serving the economic revival of all \nour countries in the process of integration into the \nEuropean Union as a developed economic area would \nbe completely ineffective. We have neither the time nor \nthe luxury to engage in time-consuming, ineffective \nprojects. No country of the region can afford such a \nluxury. Consequently, we should create new momentum \nin regional cooperation by effectively combining the \nobjectives of the South East Europe 2020 strategy with \nthe projects of the Europe 2020 agenda. We should \nnot forget that successful regional cooperation has a \ndirect effect on meeting economic accession criteria. \nUndoubtedly, meeting such criteria through intense and \nfruitful regional cooperation is neither an easy nor a \nsimple task.\n\nMy vision for Albania is also a vision of the Balkans \nworking together, in defiance of our history of so much \nwar and conflict, although \u2014 let us say it loudly and \nproudly \u2014 these are past wars and past conflicts. I want \nto share my conviction that the remarkable agreement \nbetween Kosovo and Serbia launched a new era in \nSouth-East Europe. Their dialogue, which was an act \nof courage and wisdom on the part of both Kosovo \nand Serbia, with much-appreciated facilitation by the \nEuropean Union, challenges every country of the region \nto mobilize its efforts in new and innovative forms of \ncollaboration and cooperation. \n\nNot everything is easy or perfect. There are still a \nfew here and there who continue to think in the past. But \nthe prevailing truth is that Prime Ministers Tha\u00e7i and \nDa.i. have shouldered their leadership responsibility to \nbring their countries into the future they both deserve. \n\n\n\f\nMore than anything, in a world interconnected and \ninterdependent like never before, where space and \nrelationships are related and recreated in continuity, it \nis crucial to live in the new time without prolonging the \nold one of conflicts and nationalism.\n\nIn this regard, Albania is committed to peace and \nprosperity in the region. This is why it is committed \nto the irreversible independence of Kosovo, which is \nalready recognized by 104 Member States. This is why \nit calls upon all countries that have not yet recognized \nKosovo to do so. They will not only help Kosovo and \nits people, but they will join those who, by recognizing \nKosovo, have played an important role in strengthening \nsecurity and stability in South-East Europe.\n\nTo those who are sceptical, I say that the people \nof Kosovo, like all the other peoples that now enjoy \nfully recognized, independent republics following \nthe dissolution of the former Yugoslavia, deserve the \nrecognition of their sovereignty, particularly as they \nhave demonstrated, more than any other people in the \nregion, their indisputable commitment to human rights, \nminority rights, dialogue and peace. Without this \ncommitment, it would be very difficult for our region \nto make progress towards integration into the European \nUnion. But their commitment is obvious and firm, \nand the region has been making remarkable progress \ntowards its most important goal \u2014 integration into \nthe European Union. Croatia has joined the European \nUnion. We are waiting in the queue, as are Serbia and \nKosovo.\n\nI have no doubt that, provided that each and every \ncountry of the region replaces the politics of division \nwith the politics of cooperation, and provided that we \nbuild shared values, beliefs and policies instead of \nclinging to ancient enmities, we can show how much \nwe have changed and how quickly we can make the \nfurther changes needed to take our place alongside \nothers in the modern European family of nations. It \nwill undoubtedly take time and perseverance. It will \ntake the understanding and support of European Union \nmember States. It will take leadership on the part of us \nall, and as past practice and successful examples show, \nit can be done.\n\nThis is a very serious commitment, and I would \nlike to state here that it is our firm intention to explore \nevery possibility to initiate a constructive debate, \ndevelop a real dialogue and foster close cooperation in \nevery possible aspect with each and every country of \nthe region, including, notably, Serbia. Let the Balkans, \nwhich have been known so long for war and bloodshed, \nnow be known for changing its ways and thereby change \nthe world for the better.\n\nI wish that, in this statement of hope, I could avoid \nhaving to speak about one of the most terrible human \ntragedies of our times, which has been unfolding before \nour eyes for two and a half years now. It has taken more \nthan 100,000 human lives. It is destroying an entire \ngeneration and has brought a country to ruin. The \nrecent large-scale use of chemical weapons constitutes \na despicable crime against humanity that should not \nand must not remain unpunished.\n\nYet even within such a bleak picture, there has \nbeen a glimpse of hope. Yesterday, the Security \nCouncil finally adopted resolution 2118 (2013), on the \nremoval and destruction of chemical weapons in Syria, \nwhich we welcome. It must now be quickly and fully \nimplemented. \n\nAs I walked to this rostrum, I felt the extraordinary \nsense of responsibility that the leadership of a country \nimplies. I felt the power of the historic forces pulsating \nin this building. I felt the new world it has shaped, \nthe challenges it has met, the challenges it has failed \nto meet and the challenges we, the family of nations, \nstruggle to meet today in this ever more interdependent \nand complicated world.\n\nI ran for office on the theme of renaissance, but \nwe all know that words spoken while campaigning are \nthe easy part. What is hard is turning those words into \ndeeds, actions, policies and projects that deliver change. \nI am confident, but I am humble enough to know I \ncannot do it alone. I have much to learn, and the United \nNations is one of those places where one always finds \npeople, individuals, groups and Governments who can \nteach with experience and lead by example. \n\nWe need support. We need partners and friends \nwilling to be part of our journey for change. Renaissance \nmeans a new Albania. Building the renaissance is \nthe challenge we face. It will take time. It will take \nperseverance. It will take the understanding and support \nof partners and friends. It will also take leadership, \nwhich I am committed to. But I know it can be done.\n"

        "file_text": "The central theme of the sixty-\neighth session of the General Assembly is sustainable \ndevelopment. With its three main pillars this constitutes \na comprehensive agenda, even more comprehensive with \nall of its prerequisites: conflict prevention, bringing \npeace and security to war-torn countries and bringing \nperpetrators to justice through the implementation \nof international law. Helping the weakest to help \nthemselves, shaping economies that pay focused \nattention to social-agenda and environmental issues \nand that effectively use e-technologies, protecting \nhuman rights and supporting the rule of law and \ndemocracy \u2014 these are all integral parts of sustainable \ndevelopment.\n\nThe report of the High-level Panel of Eminent \nPersons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda notes \nthat Governments bear the primary responsibility for \nassuring sustainable development and for improving the \nlives of people in their territories. Sustainability can be \ntruly implemented, however, only if we instil it in the \ncore thinking of Governments, societies, individuals \nand the international community as a whole.\n\nLet me start with what is clearly and without a \ndoubt the most unsustainable situation in the world at \nthe moment: the conflict in Syria. It has been repeated \nthousands and thousands of times, and must continue to \nbe repeated over and over again, that the use of chemical \nweapons is unacceptable under any circumstances \nand requires complete and unreserved condemnation. \nIt is clear that chemical weapons must be destroyed \nquickly and verifiably. Therefore the Organisation for \nthe Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the Security \nCouncil must \u2014 and I emphasize must \u2014 move forward \nand agree on the legally binding terms to resolve that \nissue, preferably under Chapter VII of the Charter, as \nsoon as possible.\n\nEven without the use of chemical weapons, the \nmilitary actions and brutality which have occurred in \nSyria have created suffering and a humanitarian disaster \nof unimaginable proportions. More than 110,000 \npeople have been killed, and millions of refugees and \ninternally displaced persons are scattered around the \n\n\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of \nspeeches delivered in the other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original \nlanguages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature \nof a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room \nU.506. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\n\n\n\f\nregion. About 7 million Syrians are in urgent need of \nassistance.\n\nWhile there is no quick or easy fix to that complex \nsituation, we must keep doing what we can to ease \nhuman suffering. Estonia is one of many countries that \nhave been focusing on helping those who have been \nforced to flee from their homes and protecting the most \nvulnerable members of society: women and children. I \nwould also like to praise the good work of UNICEF, the \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the \nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs \nand humanitarian workers in Syria who often by risking \ntheir own lives, have been able to organize and deliver \nassistance.\n\nEvidence collected by the Human Rights Council\u2019s \nIndependent International Commission of Inquiry \nindicates that war crimes, crimes against humanity and \ngross human rights violations have been systematically \ncommitted in Syria. Estonia is among the countries \nthat joined the Swiss initiative in January, asking the \nSecurity Council to refer the situation in Syria to the \nInternational Criminal Court. It is the responsibility of \nthe international community to protect, if a Government \nfails to do so.\n\nIn contrast, let me turn to a country and conflict \nwhere hope has been restored recently. That presidential \nelections in Mali were carried out in a peaceful and \ntransparent manner has paved the way for optimism. \nThe newly elected President has many important tasks \nahead, beginning with reconciliation between the \nsouthern and northern parts of Mali. I wish Mr. Keita all \nthe luck and energy he will need to rebuild his country, \nand I can assure him that Estonia stands among the \ncountries that will continue to help if needed.\n\nI venture to say that another country whose \nfuture looks promising is Afghanistan. I believe that \nresponsibility and ownership make people masters \nof their own fate, and I can see the willingness of \nAfghans to avail themselves of that opportunity. The \ninternational community must continue to assist that \ncountry in order to ensure that their efforts will bear \nfruit. As a long-term partner of Afghanistan, Estonia \nremains committed to assisting with the training and \nfinancing of Afghan security forces after 2014, while \ncontinuing to support educational progress, women\u2019s \nempowerment, the rule of law and health care.\n\nIt is also sadly true that conflicts can at times \nbe alarmingly sustainable. For years, Estonia has \nemphasized that protracted conflicts around Nagorno \nKarabakh and in Georgia and Moldova must not fall \noff the radar screen of the international community. \nWithout the will of all the involved parties, no lasting \nsolutions can be found.\n\nEvery year, over half a million people die as a result \nof illegal or irresponsible arms transfers. Enormous \namounts of money and resources are spent on arms, \noften at the expense of far more vital needs. We view \nthe adoption in June of the Arms Trade Treaty, within \nthe framework of the United Nations, as a historic \nmilestone for the world community.\n\nAs a responsible member of the international \ncommunity, Estonia strongly supports and contributes \nto the activities of the International Criminal Court \nand the ad hoc tribunals established by the Security \nCouncil. We continue to call for more States to ratify \nthe Rome Statute and the amendments to the Rome \nStatute relating to the crime of aggression. Universality \nis key to ensuring that the perpetrators of the worst \ncrimes of concern to the international community are \nheld accountable. Accountability and the prevention \nof atrocities have been the priorities of Estonia as a \ncurrent member of the Human Rights Council. In the \nCouncil, we also focus on the rights of women and \nchildren and on their disproportionate suffering during \narmed conflict.\n\nThe post-2015 sustainable development agenda \nshould transform the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) into Sustainable Development Goals. In the \nmeantime, we have learned that the MDGs should \nhave focused more on reaching the poorest and most-\nexcluded groups in society. The main challenge of the \npost-2015 negotiations will be to formulate and reach \nglobal agreement on one concrete and measurable \nset of development goals that would keep the three \ndimensions of sustainability in its core and maintain a \nstrong focus on poverty eradication. The targets should \nleave no one behind and be applicable and achievable \nin every country.\n\nIn many societies, women and girls are the main \ndrivers of development. Not allowing them to fulfil their \npotential through education, decent job opportunities \nand essential health services is to disregard the \npotential of one half of humankind. It is also important \nto remember that persons with disabilities have been \none of the most excluded segments of our societies, \nalthough they often have serious difficulties with access \nto basic social services and decent job opportunities.\n\n\n\f\nOfficial development assistance will continue to \nplay an important role in the sustainable development \nof many countries in the future, but it cannot compete \nwith the flow of international private investment nor \nwith domestically mobilized resources. Therefore, \nsynergies between different sources of finance, \nbetter policies and strong national ownership are \nnecessary. Nonetheless, the main drivers of sustainable \ndevelopment are inclusive and responsible economic \npolicies. A key enabler of growth is the bold use of \nmodern integrated circuit technology solutions. They \npromote better governance, access to public services, \njob creation, transparency, accountability and civil \nsociety participation.\n\nThat brings me to two issues of worldwide \nimportance: cybersecurity and Internet freedom. The \ntwo are intrinsically linked and in no way incompatible. \nMoreover, they will require a multi-stakeholder model \nof Internet governance. Freedom of opinion and \nexpression, online or offline, is a cornerstone of every \ndemocracy and constitutes a fundamental human right. \nLast year, the Human Rights Council affirmed that very \nsame principle. I am glad that the United Nations Group \nof Governmental Experts on Cyber Issues affirmed that \ninternational law is essential in promoting an open, \nsecure and accessible cyberspace.\n\nIn our fight against cybercrime, it is essential to raise \nawareness and to work on prevention by everyone, from \nprivate computer users to large critical infrastructure \nand cloud providers. Raising the awareness of political \nleaders and national governments is equally important; \ncybercrime may have serious consequences for national \nsecurity as well as national wealth. Yet the Council of \nEurope\u2019s 2001 European Cybercrime Treaty \u2014 renamed \nthe Convention on Cybercrime because participants are \nfrom all over the world, and also known as the Budapest \nConvention \u2014 remains thus far the only legally binding \ninternational instrument that addresses cybercrime. \nNeedless to say, the more countries accede to it, the \nmore functional it will become. We find it odd that \nthose countries with the largest sources of cybercrime \nhave not acceded to the Convention, while in other \nareas they stress the primacy of international law.\n\nThe United Nations has had and will continue to \nhave a leading role in making the world sustainable. Yet \nGovernments can do and must do their own fair share. \nEstonia, for example, proudly continues to support the \ninitiatives of civil society in contributing to sustainable \ndevelopment. Approximately one half of the world\u2019s \ncountries have joined our 2008 initiative \u201cLet\u2019s Do It!\u201d \nto make people\u2019s environments cleaner and our planet \nenvironmentally happier.\n\nLet us remain alert and tuned in to every single \ndetail that prevents us from advancing our common \nwell-being, be it in developed or in developing countries. \nLet us be united in that common effort.\n"

        "file_text": "It is often \nsaid that things always come in threes. Indeed, this is \n\nthe third time that I have had the privilege to address \nthe Assembly as President of the Transition of the \nRepublic of Madagascar. Here we are again, convening \nas we do every year for the General Assembly. All \nthe leaders of the planet meet regularly to debate, \nexchange views and share their experiences within the \nframework of a process of consultations that belongs \nto a long collective march towards peace, security and \nsustainable planetary development. But each year, new, \never more violent and more lethal conflicts are waged, \nrequiring that we respond with equal intensity. Shall \nwe limit ourselves to simply speaking about conflict \nresolution, or shall we to challenge ourselves, analyse \nthe underlying causes and take the necessary measures \nto preserve stability in the world? \n\nAs I add my voice to those who have spoken before \nme, I warmly congratulate the President on the votes \nthat he won in support of his candidacy. Madagascar \nwill endeavour to provide him its sincere support and \ncooperation.\n\nRegrettably, over recent decades, when we speak \nof Africa, we generally see States that are exposed \nto permanent violence and the progressive loss of \ndemocracy, States where wars, conflicts and crises \ncontinually break out and there is more division than \nconsensus. According to Ambassador Jeremi., who \npresided at the sixty-seventh session of the General \nAssembly, humankind is facing an existential crisis, \nwith symptoms such as economic instability, social \ninequalities and environmental degradation. \n\nFor my part, I would add that humankind may be \nlosing its forward momentum but that it is not giving \nup. Yes, the news delivered by the media every day is \nextremely worrying throughout the world. Whether the \ncountry is developed, emerging or poor, no segment of \nsociety escapes deterioration of various kinds, including \npoor employment conditions, unemployment, declining \npurchasing power, the total absence of any income at \nall, lack of access to basic necessities in food, clothing, \nhealth care and education, and, in addition, poverty, \ndeprivation and indigence. Those are all factors that \nare the nurturing ground for intolerance, confrontation \nand conflict, thereby helping to give rise to global \ninsecurity. I refer here particularly to recent events in \nKenya, Iraq, Pakistan and Syria, to name just a few. We \nfully share in the pain and sorrow of the families of the \nvictims. \n\nSome 800 days from the deadline of 2015, like \nmost African States and many developing countries, \nMadagascar is finding it difficult to attain all the \nMillennium Development Goals, despite the efforts \neveryone has made. Given that situation, I have to \nwonder what sort of contribution we, the leaders of our \nnations, can make individually to that collective effort, \nwith a view to finding ways of improving the daily lives \nof those who have put their trust in us and placed their \ndestiny in our hands.\n\nIn his statement yesterday (see A/68/PV.5), \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon stressed the fact that, \nin streets and squares across the world, people are \npressing those in power. They want world leaders to \nlisten. They want to know that we are doing everything \nwe can to secure a life of dignity for all. The popular \nunrest in the context of the Arab Spring and the \nmovements of the outraged exemplify this observation \nand reflect a legitimate aspiration. I fully support the \nSecretary-General\u2019s remarks and call upon all of us to \nensure that we clearly understand the demands of the \ndemonstrators. \n\nMadagascar would also have wished to benefit \nfrom such understanding when the Malagasy people \nrose up against an unpopular regime to demand a better \nlife through the establishment of genuine change. But \nthat was not the case. On the contrary, Madagascar \nencountered misunderstanding and the inflexibility of \nan international community operating at various speeds, \nnot to mention the application of dogmatic texts, even \nthough popular uprisings elsewhere, in very similar \ncircumstances, had been viewed sympathetically and \nwith concern.\n\nEfforts must therefore now be made to end the \nunequal treatment of countries in crisis. We must \nbecome aware of popular aspirations and realities on \nthe ground so as not to take the wrong decision. If it \nis valid elsewhere, surely it is also valid in the case of \nMadagascar? \n\nAll the conditions were in place in Madagascar. \nThe danger of a social explosion and a fratricidal \nconflict was omnipresent, but fortunately \u2014 unlike \nsome countries that continue to experience unrest and \neven armed violence, and despite all the economic \nand social restrictions and the absence of support and \nassistance from the international community from \nwhich Madagascar has suffered in recent years \u2014 the \npeople of Madagascar did not fall into the trap of internal \nconflict, which some would have taken advantage of.\n\n\n\f\nIt is with great national pride that I announce \nfrom this rostrum that Madagascar was able to avoid \ncivil war. That required considerable sacrifice, self-\ndenial and humility, but we came through thanks \nto our patriotism. I reiterate the fact that despite our \ndisagreements and our different points of view, we have \nreached a settlement of our conflict using all available \nnegotiation methods. I would like to solemnly thank the \nMalagasy people, who are a peaceful people and aspire \nto peace and whose courage and patience have been \nunmatched in the peaceful settlement of our political \ncrisis. \n\nThe Malagasy people deserve a better future. \nCitizens will be able to freely express their choices \non their future leader through the ballot box at the \nupcoming presidential elections, scheduled to take \nplace on 25 October this year, for which the electoral \ncampaign began yesterday.\n\nMadagascar is now starting a new phase in its \nhistory. I would like to warmly thank all those who, \nthroughout the process of Madagascar\u2019s emergence \nfrom its crisis, supported and assisted us during the \ntransition period, in particular, the Southern African \nDevelopment Community (SADC), the various \npresidents of the SADC Troika, the African Union, the \nEuropean Union, the United Nations, the Organization \nof Islamic Cooperation, the International Organization \nof la Francophonie, and all friendly countries without \nexception, without forgetting those who have already \ndemonstrated their willingness to provide international \nobservers for the elections. At the same time, I would \nlike to renew my appeal to the entire General Assembly \nto join the ranks of our partners.\n\nWe are at a crossroads. The people expect specific \nand tangible results. The question is, do we have the \ncourage and the wisdom to sacrifice ourselves for the \nwell-being of our people and to avoid conflict and civil \nwar, so that innocent people do not lose their lives, so \nthat those who are in power no longer use weapons and \nso that no one resorts to violence? \n\nAs a leader, I realize that the exercise of power \nrequires an awareness of our humanity and our \nfallibility. That is the message that Madagascar would \nlike convey as its contribution to this general debate \ntoday. The world is changing very quickly, a new \ngeneration is rising to replace the old one, and leaders \nhave the duty to meet the expectations of our people \nand to find a solution to ensure their well-being.\n\nIn my case, I did everything I could to overcome \nthe political crisis in Madagascar and maintain national \nunity and the best interests of the Malagasy people. \nI also decided that I will not be a candidate in the \nupcoming presidential elections. It is on that note, and \nwith the well-known words of American theologian \nand writer James Freeman Clarke, that I would like to \nconclude: \u201cA politician thinks of the next election. A \nstatesman, of the next generation.\u201d\n"

        "file_text": "Let me first of all congratulate \nyou, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. We \nwish you every success and assure you of our fullest \ncooperation.\n\nAt a time when the world is facing multiple \nchallenges, there is renewed attention to the role of \nthe United Nations in advancing international peace, \nsecurity and prosperity. However, never has scepticism \nabout the capacity of the United Nations to do so been \nhigher, or the external environment less propitious for \nmultilateralism.\n\nThe nearly seven decades of work of the United \nNations hold one simple lesson: that we are most \nsuccessful when we adhere to the letter and spirit of \nthe United Nations Charter, basing our decisions on the \nwidest possible consensus and balancing equitably the \nneeds and responsibilities of nations at different stages \nand levels of development.\n\nIn those seven decades, the world has changed in \nfundamental ways. Asia and Africa are independent \nand resurgent. Countries are now not only more \ninterdependent, but also face new, increasingly complex \nchallenges. For multilateralism to remain relevant and \neffective in the future, multilateral institutions need to \nbe reformed urgently. The place to begin is right here.\n\nThe Security Council must be reformed and \nrestructured to reflect current political realities. \nMore developing countries should be included as both \npermanent and non-permanent members.\n\nThe multilateral financial institutions should also \nenable an enhanced voice for developing countries in \ntheir decision-making structures. Multilateral efforts \nmust guide our quest for peace and security, wherever \nthey are threatened, and the centrality and contribution \nof the United Nations system to development must be \nrestored.\n\nThose objectives require the building of a new \ninternational consensus suited to our time and rooted \nin today\u2019s realities. It is only such a plan of action that \nwill enable the United Nations to meet the twin tests of \nlegitimacy, and effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nWe commend your choice of the theme of this \nsession. Setting the stage for the post-2015 development \nagenda is especially important as we deal with a \nlingering global economic slowdown and continuing \nvolatility in financial markets. These have imposed \ndisproportionately heavy costs on developing countries \nand the vulnerable groups within them.\n\nGrowth and inclusive development are naturally \nimportant for all our countries. They require a \nsupportive international economic environment, \nenhanced investment flows, including from multilateral \ndevelopment banks, the transfer of technology, and an \nopen multilateral trading regime.\n\nBut the problems of the more than 1 billion people \nliving in abject poverty around the world need to be \nattacked more directly. Poverty remains a major \npolitical and economic challenge, and its eradication \nrequires special attention and a new collective thrust. \nThat priority should anchor the post-2015 development \nagenda, which should be shaped by the Member States \nso that it enjoys the broadest possible support and \nacceptance.\n\nIssues of peace, security, human rights and \ngovernance are important and need to be addressed. But \nwe will fall short of realizing an ambitious post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda if we focus merely on governance \nissues at the cost of robust economic growth. This \nagenda should not be merely about reprioritizing \ndomestic spending, but also about fostering genuine \ninternational partnerships between developing and \ndeveloped countries to bring about change. All of us \nneed the policy space necessary to set our own domestic \npriorities. \n\nNo one knows the condition of developing countries \nbetter than the developing countries themselves. It is \ntherefore important that the United Nations set clear and \nconcise goals and provide practical and well-defined \nmeans of implementation, including an adequate flow \nof resources and the transfer of technology, taking the \nviews of developing countries fully into account.\n\n\n\f\nA meaningful post-2015 agenda must place equally \nhigh priority on food and nutrition, health, education, \ninfrastructure, water, sanitation, energy and combating \ndiscrimination against women. Especially critical is \nwomen\u2019s equal access to economic opportunities and \nensuring that they do not become victims of violence or \nthe targets of prejudice.\n\nIn India, we have sought to promote inclusive \ndevelopment in multiple ways. Legislation has broadened \naccess to education and secured rural livelihoods. We \nare now building the world\u2019s largest programme for \nfood security. Digital technology is being harnessed to \nimprove the delivery of public services and benefits to \nthe people.\n\nIndia is proud of its partnerships with developing \ncountries. Using modest resources, we have built strong \nties with Africa and the least developed countries. We \nare committed to building 100 institutions in Africa \nand have offered capacity-building support, including \nthousands of scholarships, and made available over \n$9.5 billion of concessional assistance. India and Africa \nare engaging through the India-Africa Forum Summit \nprocess. We also look forward to participating actively \nin the third International Conference on Small Island \nDeveloping States, to be held in Samoa in 2014, and to \ncontributing to its outcome.\n\nClimate change is one of the defining challenges of \nour times. We must summon the political will necessary \nto craft a robust global response to climate change on \nthe basis of equity and the principle of common but \ndifferentiated responsibilities.\n\nWe are deeply concerned about the future of West \nAsia, a region with which India shares deep bonds of \nhistory and one that is critical for our energy security \nas well as the livelihoods of the nearly 7 million \nIndians who work and live in the region. Not only is \nthe increasingly lethal conflict in Syria a tragedy for \nthe people of Syria, but it also threatens stability and \nsecurity in the region and beyond. It has been made worse \nby the use of chemical weapons. The use of chemical \nweapons, whosoever may have deployed them, must \nbe condemned in the strongest possible terms. India \nstrongly supports the elimination of chemical-weapons \nmaterial and equipment in Syria.There is no military \nsolution to that conflict. We must intensify efforts to \nend the conflict and seek a political settlement. It is \nessential that the \u201cGeneva II\u201d conference be convened \nat the earliest opportunity.\n\nWe are encouraged that direct talks have resumed \nbetween Israel and Palestine. India supports the early \nrealization of a sovereign, independent, viable and \nunited State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its \ncapital, living within secure and recognized borders, \nside by side and at peace with Israel. We also remain \ncommitted to the Palestinian quest for full membership \nin the United Nations.\n\nIn our own region, Afghanistan prepares for a \nhistoric political, security and economic transition. \nThe international community must support the people \nof Afghanistan through this transition and beyond in \ncombating terrorism, preserving the progress of the \npast decade and creating a stable, united and prosperous \nAfghanistan.\n\nTerrorism remains a grave threat to security and \nstability everywhere and exacts a heavy toll of innocent \nlives around the world. From Africa to Asia, we have \nseen several manifestations of this menace in the last \nfew days alone. State-sponsored, cross-border terrorism \nis of particular concern to India, also on account of \nthe fact that the epicentre of terrorism in our region is \nlocated in our neighbourhood, in Pakistan.\n\nFrom this rostrum yesterday, Prime Minister Nawaz \nSharif of Pakistan spoke of making a new beginning \n(see A/68/PV.15). I reciprocate his sentiments and \nam looking forward to meeting him tomorrow. India \nis sincerely committed to resolving all issues with \nPakistan, including the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, \nthrough bilateral dialogue on the basis of the Simla \nAgreement. However, for progress to be made, it is \nimperative that the territory of Pakistan and the areas \nunder its control not be utilized for aiding and abetting \nterrorism directed against India. It is equally important \nthat the terrorist machinery that draws its sustenance \nfrom Pakistan be shut down. There must be a clear \nunderstanding of the fact that Jammu and Kashmir is \nan integral part of India and that there can never, ever, \nbe a compromise with the unity and territorial integrity \nof India.\n\nWe need to renew our commitment, especially \nhere at the United Nations, to concerted, cohesive and \ncontinuing global action against terrorism. There can \nbe no tolerance for States sheltering, arming, training or \nfinancing terrorists. Nor can States absolve themselves \nof the responsibility to prevent their territories from \nbeing used to launch acts of terrorism.\n\n\n\f\nThe increasingly complex challenges to \ninternational peace and security require a new \ninternational consensus to be built, whether it is in the \nfield of cybersecurity, non-proliferation or terrorism. \nThis year, 25 years after Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi \nput forward a comprehensive action plan for a nuclear-\nweapon-free and non-violent world order, we must \nstrengthen efforts against nuclear proliferation and \npursue time-bound, universal, non-discriminatory, \nphased and verifiable nuclear disarmament. We must \nalso guard against terrorists and non-State actors \ngaining access to sensitive materials and technologies.\n\nTwo years from now, the United Nations will be \n70 years old. Every new State born during that period \nof 70 years has taken its place in the Assembly not just \nwith pride but also with hope. The year 2015 will be \na time to celebrate our successes and ensure that the \nUnited Nations is ready for this century, by completing \nmuch-needed reforms of the Organization and its \nSecurity Council, developing an ambitious and balanced \npost-2015 development agenda and demonstrating our \ncapacity to cooperate effectively for durable peace and \nsecurity in the world we live in.\n"

        "file_text": "I would \nparticularly like to congratulate the President of \nthe General Assembly and his country Antigua and \nBarbuda, a member of the Group of Latin American \nand Caribbean States and the Community of Latin \nAmerican and Caribbean States. It is an honour for all \nLatin Americans that he is presiding over the General \nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session.\n\nI would like to begin by expressing our solidarity \nwith the victims of the attacks in Kenya and Pakistan, \nand generally to all the victims of the terrorist attacks \noccurring in various parts of the world. I say this not \nout of formal sympathy or for reasons of protocol, but \n\n\n\f\nbecause our country, Argentina, along with the United \nStates of America, is the only one on the American \ncontinent to have suffered a terrorist attack \u2014 in \nour case, on two occasions: in 1992, when the Israeli \nEmbassy in the city of Buenos Aires was blown up, \nand two years later, when the Jewish community centre \nAMIA in Argentina was bombed. Some of the relatives \nof the victims are here with us, as always, and I can see \nthem from here. Clearly, we are talking about victims. \nThese were not soldiers or fighters. They were people \nwho were getting on a bus, perhaps entering a bar or \ngoing to work, and who were surprised by an explosion. \nThey had not taken part in any war; they were not \ncombatants or soldiers; they had not chosen to go \nand fight. So I am thinking of those victims and their \nfamilies, who deserve our solidarity and the strongest \npossible condemnation of all forms of terrorism.\n\nIn the context of this sixty-eighth session of the \nAssembly, we see the Syrian question as a common \nthread. Almost in a premonition, only a short while \nago I was here at the United Nations, presiding over a \nmeeting of the Security Council, of which Argentina is \na non-permanent member for 2013-2014. On 6 August, \njust about a month and a half ago, we proposed a \nmeasure to reform the Security Council. We stated \nthat the functioning and the rationale of the Council \nactually reflected another era, that of the Cold War, \nwhen fear of nuclear holocaust had led to the creation of \nthe Organization, uniting the forces that had defeated \nNazi Germany, and then produced a bipolar world. That \nfear of nuclear war resulted in a system with veto power \nso that no one would be able to push a button and blow \nup the world. The fact is that that instrument, which \nworked in 1945, has now been shown to be dysfunctional \nand completely obsolete \u2014 and not only as regards the \nSyrian question, but also when it comes to dealing with \nissues affecting peace and security around the world.\n\nIncidentally, I would like to express my appreciation \nfor the fact that for the first time we have been given \nthe opportunity to speak at such a late hour of the day, \nbecause it has somewhat interrupted the inertia of the \ncourse of the meeting. There are times when we come \nto these meetings with a format, almost a monologue, \nthat makes it difficult to present arguments or counter-\narguments that take into account the statements made \nby previous speakers. I have listened very carefully \nto almost all of the addresses given earlier today. \nObviously, I paid particular attention to those that touch \non the global decision-making system, and, of course, \nbecause I am a staunch supporter of multilateralism, I \npaid a lot of attention to the first address, by Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon.\n\nIn many of those statements I heard mention of \n21 August. On 6 August, we spoke of the need for \nSecurity Council reform and of the fact that the right \nof veto is no longer necessary. There should be a \nsystem \u2014 such as those used by regional organizations \nof the Americas, such as the Union of South American \nNations, Community of Latin American and Caribbean \nStates or the Southern Common Market and its \nassociated States \u2014 in which decisions are taken by \nconsensus. Why is that? Governmental administration \nis different, as the power of veto is necessary in order \nto govern. When dealing with conflict resolution \nand management, if one party to the conflict, or \nan interested party, has the right of veto, that right \nnecessarily becomes an obstacle to the resolution of \nthe conflict. We did not know what would occur 15 or \n16 days later. Many have noted that the crisis in Syria \nerupted on 21 August. \n\nIn fact, it is extremely difficult to understand \nthat the current crisis in Syria was only recognized \non 21 August, when we became aware of chemical \nweapons. Syria has been caught up in that conflict for \nover two and a half years. Over 150,000 people have \nlost their lives and 99 per cent of them died as a result \nof conventional weapons \u2014 not chemical weapons. I \nremember that at the last meeting of the Group of Twenty \n(G-20), during a discussion about Syria, I asked, \u201cWhat \nis the difference between a death resulting from bullets, \nanti-personnel mines, missiles or hand grenades, and a \ndeath resulting from chemical weapons?\u201d Each is more \nor less equally shocking. As it is not the first time, \nwhy is there talk of chemical weapons as if it were the \nfirst time that chemical weapons or weapons of mass \ndestruction have been used? \n\nI recall a statement made by another leader \ntoday with reference to the terrible gas chambers of \nthe Nazis, the gas in the trenches and the chemical \nweapons used in other instances. I also remember \nhearing about and reading about \u2014 as I had not yet \nbeen born \u2014 the nuclear holocaust in Hiroshima and \nNagasaki and the consequences of using those weapons \non many generations of Japanese people. \n\nI remember when I was much younger \u2014 the \nPresident of Uruguay also recalled the time of his \nyouth, I was less than 20 years of age, and many others \nwill probably also remember \u2014 when napalm and \nphosphorous were used during the Viet Nam War. That \n\n\n\f\nwas recorded forever in the Pulitzer prize-winning \nphotographs of naked boys and a naked girl. I remember, \nas if it were today, that naked young girl running down \na road after having been hit by napalm in a bombing.\n\nI also remember, in all fairness, the suffering of the \npeople of the United States when they saw the doors of \nthe planes open and they saw the corpses of the soldiers \nwho had gone to fight being removed, wrapped in black \nplastic bags. I can imagine the pain of each girlfriend, \neach sister, each wife, each daughter of the soldier \nwho had died, trying to understand why. Many did not \nunderstand why the soldiers had had to lose their lives \nmany thousands of kilometres away from their country. \nIt is so irrational, so unjust. There are no just wars. \nOnly peace is just.\n\nOn 6 August, in the discussions on the issue of peace \nand security, it was stated that peace and security are not \nmilitary concepts; rather, they are political concepts. \nToday, I was pleased to hear the Secretary-General \nmention that very concept, which we had referred to \nin the Security Council \u2014 namely, that peace and \nsecurity are not military but rather political concepts. \nTherefore, we welcome the fact that an agreement has \nbeen reached on the question of Syria. My country \nopposed direct intervention \u2014 bombing. It was quite \nsimple. The argument that, in order to avoid deaths, you \nwould cause even more deaths could not be sustained \nby any reasoning or even common sense. We did not \nspeak out at that time only to speak. Furthermore, we \nwere not discussing just any country, but one with great \nrespect for the norms of international law.\n\nMy country, Argentina, has signed the Treaty on the \nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), making \nArgentina one of the most advanced countries \u2014 if not \nthe most advanced country \u2014 in developing nuclear \npower for peaceful and scientific purposes. We sell \nnuclear power generators to Egypt, Algeria and \nAustralia. We also use nuclear energy for medical \npurposes. We do not condemn the use of nuclear energy \nfor warfare while at the same time deploying nuclear \nsubmarines. That has been our experience, for example, \nin connection with the sovereignty dispute involving \nour Malvinas Islands, since the United Kingdom has \nmilitarized the southern Atlantic region and sent nuclear \nsubmarines. We have no double standards. We are not \nhypocritical. We have not only signed the NPT but are \nalso parties to the Rome Statute of the International \nCriminal Court (ICC), as was also mentioned by the \nSecretary-General in his statement.\n\nIn other words, when we speak of condemning \ndictators, we are actually parties to the Rome Statute and \ncan be brought before the Court. We are also members \nof the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights \nin Washington, D.C. It is curious that many who speak \nof respect for human rights, the relevant institutions, \ninternational law and the ICC and often refer to human \nrights have not signed the treaties on the subject.\n\nIf one is to speak of human rights, Argentina \nhas accomplished a great deal. We were a founding \nMember of the Organization and promoted the creation \nof a human rights secretariat within the United Nations \nand the International Convention for the Protection of \nAll Persons from Enforced Disappearance. I am joined \nhere by the head of the Asociaci\u00f3n Madres de Plaza de \nMayo. She was also with me in Paris to sign the treaty, \nof which we are a founding party.\n\nI referred to human rights because there was \nsomething said today about human rights in another \nspeech. It has been said here that if this is the world \nin which people want to live, then they should say so \nand be prepared to face the cold logic of mass graves. \nArgentina too can speak of mass graves. Even today, \nwell into the twenty-first century, we continue to \ncome upon mass graves that hold the remains of the \nthousands of prisoners and those who disappeared \nunder the genocidal dictatorship that began 24 March \n1976, which was similar to the one that took power \non 11 September 1973 in our sister republic of Chile, \noverthrowing the democratically elected Government \nof Salvador Allende.\n\nHow wonderful it would have been, after all the \nspeeches condemning genocidal dictators, if someone \nback then had come to the aid of the Argentine and \nChilean and so many other peoples of the American \ncontinent who, in the midst of the Cold War, were the \nsacrificial victims of murderous dictators. But it was \nalso said here that, if those who cared about human \nrights were moved to act on someone\u2019s behalf, perhaps \nif that concern had at least coincided with the interests \nof some great Power, they would have acted differently. \nWe have spoken of those things here, including the \nneed to put an end to that double standard, and we have \nsaid that the resolutions and decisions of a multilateral \norganization such as the United Nations must take place \non a level playing field for the weak and the strong, the \nsmall and the large. \n\nWe have been waiting since 1965, when the \nplenary and many resolutions of the Assembly and \n\n\n\f\nthe Committee on Decolonization required both \nArgentina and the United Kingdom to sit down to \nhold a dialogue \u2014 another word that I have repeatedly \nheard in every speech. There is a dispute over the \nmatter of sovereignty over the Malvinas, and yet,the \nUnited Kingdom has turned a cold shoulder. And so \nwe continue with double standards, which some people \ndo not like to hear mention of. But hypocrisies are like \nwitches; evidently, they exist. \n\nI have also heard \u2014 I should add that I have heard \nwith pleasure, so not everything has to do with double \nstandards \u2014 that there has at last been recognition, as \nan essential basis for beginning to untie the Gordian \nknot that the matter of the Middle East represents, of \nthe need to recognize the State of Palestine and the \nright of the State of Israel to live securely within its \nborders. Moreover, I think it has quite rightly been said \nthat it is impossible to achieve security for the State of \nIsrael unless there is also recognition of the existence, \nand support for the viability of the physical existence \nof, the State of Palestine. We can do no less than agree \non that characterization.\n\nI have also heard the new President of the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran, and I have heard the comments that \nthe great Powers have made about that change of \nGovernment. If I understood correctly, there appears \nto be a kind of new expectation of change in the face \nof the new authorities in the Republic of Iran, with \nwhich, as the Assembly knows, we have a disagreement \nthat stems from \u2014 a cause of mine \u2014 a formal case \nby the Argentine judiciary against five Iranian citizens \nin connection with their participation in the bombing \nof the Asociaci\u00f3n Mutual Israelita Argentina. It has \nnow been 10 years since, for the first time, on 25 May \n2003, then President N\u00e9stor Kirchner called in this \nsame Hall for the Islamic Republic of Iran to cooperate \nin clarifying the facts of that case. Year after year \nuntil 2007, he continued to do so, and from 2007 until \ntoday I myself have also continued to do so. A little \nover a year ago, we received a reply from the then \nForeign Minister of Iran offering to initiate talks and \nreach an agreement on cooperation. Why? For a very \nsimple reason. Because the case has been stalled for \n19 years. Nothing has moved. If there are five Iranian \naccused, the only one with whom I can and must speak \nso that the judge can take a deposition from those five \ncitizens is obviously the Republic of Iran. That seems \nvery obvious, but often in this peculiar world, even in \nmy own country, which is also a bit peculiar, obvious \nthings have to be explained.\n\nI have also heard today about imperfect choices. \nI liked that expression, which was used by one of \nthe Presidents. I think that when Argentina spends \n10 years asking for cooperation and then suddenly \nsomeone finally says \u201cFine, we are going to talk; we \nare going to cooperate\u201d, there was no other possible \nchoice except to sit down together. That issue used was \ninternally in our country to attack us politically, and \nhere too in the United States by the vulture funds to pit \nus against the United States Congress and say that we \nwere reaching an agreement, a treaty, with Iran. But \non what? Nuclear weapons? No. On a strategic alliance \nto attack the West? No. On an agreement to convert to \nIslam? No. The agreement was simply to unblock the \nprocedural impasse in order for the Argentine judiciary \nto take depositions from the accused, while at the same \ntime ensuring due process through a commission of \ninternational jurists who would be neither Iranian nor \nArgentine and whose actions would not be binding. \n\nThe treaty was approved in my country nine months \nago. I could almost say that the baby is about to be \nborn, if I were to put it in biological terms or in terms \nof childbirth. It was approved by all the appropriate \norganisms, including the Parliament. It was published \nin the official bulletin. The world knows that Argentina \nhas duly complied with that treaty. To those who found \nit so convenient for Iran \u2014 after nine years with no \nnews or notification or agreement from the Iranian \nauthorities, I wonder if we were not right ourselves \nwhen we affirmed and said that it was a way to unblock \nthe issue.\n\nThe fact is that there is now a new Government to \nwhose speeches I listened attentively, and a President \nwho declared in statements I read that he in no way \ndenied the Holocaust. That is very important. At least \nit is important to me and to many citizens around \nthe world. Even today, he specifically declared that \nthrough the recent election, by displacing a leader \nwhose positions we have all heard, so there is no point \nin repeating them, Iranian society had proved that it \nwanted more moderate positions. We have heard, from \nthis very rostrum and these very microphones, that there \nis a will to agree, to talk, to be an open and peaceful \ndemocratic society, and to act in goodwill.\n\nThe President of France referred to the nuclear \ncase as the important matter pertaining to Iran; I \nwould like to speak about the issue of the Asociaci\u00f3n \nMutual Israelita Argentina as the other major issue. \nThey said they would make gestures by opening up to \n\n\n\f\nnegotiations, and that they did not want weapons for \nmilitary use. In other words, as I understood it, they \nwere saying that they would adhere to what we support, \nwhich is non-proliferation. Now we wait to be told if \nthe agreement has been approved, or when it will be. \nMoreover, we await the announcement of the date for \nthe establishment of the commission, as well as a date \nfor the Argentine judge to travel to Tehran \u2014 yes, to \nTehran; we are not afraid and we will go there.\n\nWe believe in the goodwill of people, and there is \nno reason for us not to believe that they actually want \npeace. Everyone who has spoken here has said they \nwanted peace and that they loved one another, so we \nbelieve everyone. But we also hope to see everyone \nacting consistent with their words and actions. I \ntherefore wanted to put this specific question on the \ntable. I have no doubt that, if the words we have heard \nhere are true, we will see a positive response. I say that \nto avoid any misunderstanding as to our deep conviction \nand belief in the rules of international law, and also \nto make it clear that our patience does not mean that \nwe are naive or even foolish. We think that more than \nenough time has gone by, and we think answers are now \nneeded. The victims deserve this. The Islamic Republic \nof Iran deserves that too, if it really wants to show to \nthe world that this is a different Government and that \nits actions are also different. I trust that this will be the \ncase. I have no reason to think otherwise.\n\nAs for other matters that I wish to discuss, let me \nsay that we are \u201cserial abiders\u201d when it comes to the \nnorms of international law. We are also \u201cserial victims\u201d \nof other unwritten rules that are nevertheless very \nimportant in today\u2019s world of finance and economics. \nThey are norms not written by the major international \nfinancial centres or the risk-rating agencies or those \nthat speculate, like the vulture funds, when it comes to \ndealing with countries that, like Argentina, defaulted \non their debt, in the case of Argentina in 2001.\n\nThere has also been talk here of poverty and the \nneed for children to have access to education. I wish to \nread out two paragraphs of the address by the Secretary-\nGeneral. The first has to do with weapons, wherein he \nspeaks about poverty and points out that \n\n\u201cat a time of pressing human need, spending on \nweapons remains absurdly high. Let us get our \npriorities right and invest in people instead of \nwasting billions of dollars on deadly weapons.\u201d \n(A/68/PV.5, p. 3)\nFor the record, Argentina does not produce any \nchemical weapons, or even sell conventional weapons. \nIt would be interesting to find out \u2014 as I mentioned \nat the G-20 \u2014 who supplies weapons to the rebel \ngroups that are fighting the Syrian Government. It goes \nwithout saying that the Government of Syria possesses \nthe weapons of a State. We would like to know who \nsupplies the weapons to those who fight the Syrian \nGovernment. This is not about taking any sides; rather \nit is just about putting forward something that is quite \nlogical, for the weapons trade is today a real business.\n\nDid we really have to wait for 1,000 people to die \nas a result of chemical weapons to realize that 150,000 \nothers had died before them? Why was an arms \nembargo not declared two years ago to prevent so many \ndeaths? Well, that should be answered by those who sell \nweapons. We do not sell them and therefore cannot give \nan answer to that question \u2014 although we suspect what \nit would be.\n\nI would also like to read out another very significant \npassage in which the Secretary-General talked about \nthe economic situation. Although the question of Syria \nhas been the common thread running through the \nwhole Assembly, it is clear that the economic crisis that \nstarted here in the United States with the bankruptcy of \nLehman Brothers in 2008 still, despite all speeches and \nthings we have seen and heard, continues to generate \nvolatility and fragility. The latter is a term that was \noften invoked, and not just in the G-20.\n\nWe see millions of people unemployed around the \nworld, a situation that very much reminds us of that in \nArgentina in 2001 when we defaulted on our own debt. \nThis is linked to the fact that we are also serial victims \nof the unwritten rules of the lobbyists, of risk-rating \nagencies and of those who trade in financial derivatives \nand speculate like vultures hovering over countries in \ndefault, buying securities at very low prices and then \nattempting to make millions. That is the Argentine \ncase, but it could be the story of any other country, very \nsoon in fact. \n\nSince the Government of former President N\u00e9stor \nKirchner first took office, on 25 May 2003, Argentina \nbegan to explore how to emerge from its debt, which \naccounted for 160 per cent of our country\u2019s gross \nnational product. We had 25 per cent unemployment, \na poverty rate of 54 per cent and more than 30 per cent \nin extreme poverty. Many countries could perhaps see \nthemselves mirrored in that state of affairs. \n\n\n\f\nIn 2005 we organized the first restructuring process, \nwhich was accepted by 76 per cent of our creditors. \nDuring my own Government in 2010 we reopened the \ndebt-restructuring process and managed to secure the \napproval of 93 per cent of our creditors. Consider that, in \nany country that has insolvency laws, when companies \ngo bankrupt the law requires the agreement of at least \n66 per cent of the creditors in order for the bankruptcy \njudge to make the remaining creditors accept the \nterms \u2014 at least, that is the case in Argentina. I think \nthe number is the same in the United States, that is, \n66 per cent. In addition, here in the United States even \nmunicipalities can declare bankruptcy, and a judge may \ndecide that, if the sustainability of the municipality is at \nstake, an even lower figure is acceptable. \n\nThe fact remains that in 2010 Argentina reached \nagreement with 93 per cent of its creditors. Since 2005, \nArgentina has consistently and in a timely manner paid \neach and every one of its debt maturities, so much so \nthat the last payment was made only a few days ago. \nThat involved a bond subject to Argentine domestic \nlaw, payable in Buenos Aires. We paid $2.07 billion, \nand today our debt to gross domestic product ratio is \na little under 45 per cent, down from 160 per cent, as I \nmentioned before. Much of the debt is actually public-\nsector debt. The foreign-currency-denominated debt of \nArgentina is only 8 per cent of gross domestic product, \ndue both to national and foreign private holders. I \nwould reiterate, however, that we have been in strict \ncompliance. \n\nIn 2008, seven years after Argentina defaulted \non its debt, the vulture funds, as we call them, \nswooped in. The United Nations is caught between the \nvultures of debt and the hawks of war. It is worse than \nHitchcock\u2019s The Birds, since Hitchcock, at least, was \na good director. But what is certain is that bonds were \npurchased for $40 million, and they now wish to collect \non that while disregarding the creditors\u2019 agreement to \ncertain arrangements and extensions. The creditors, \nlike any group of creditors, wanted to be repaid and \nso approved certain arrangements and extensions. But \nthe vulture funds want to recover the whole nominal \nvalue of the bonds, without arrangements, extensions or \ndelay. From the $40 million that they initially bought in \nthe so-called self-regulated markets, they will recover \n$1.7 billion. So from 2008, we are talking about a yield \nof over 1,300 per cent. \n\nI would like to ask the Secretary-General where \nwe can find businesspeople devoted to creating jobs, \ninnovating and investing in production if, in this kind \nof casino economy, somebody can buy $40 million in \ndefaulted bonds and then secure a court decision that \nenables them to collect $1.3 or $1.7 billion.\n\nThis is not only an Argentinian problem; this is a \nproblem that involves the whole world. This is why we \nwish to thank the Republic of France for having gone \nto the United States Supreme Court and presented itself \nas amicus curiae. We also thank the former head of the \nInternational Monetary Fund, Anne Krueger. She is not \nand has never been a very good friend of Argentina\u2019s, \nbut she also did that. \n\nWe also remember the former United States \nSecretary of the Treasury, Paul O\u2019Neill, who, when it \nwas decided to leave Argentina to its own devices in \n2001, amidst a social and institutional crisis that left \n30 people dead as a result of violence in the streets, \nsaid that American plumbers should not have to pay \nfor an Argentine fiesta. Today, I say that the millions \nof Argentines who went back to work, the millions of \nArgentines who can once again entertain hopes and \ndreams, the scientists who returned to the country and \nthe children who once again have access to education \ndo not have to pay for the lobbyists\u2019 fiesta. These \nlobbyists, by participating in political campaigns and \ncontributing money to the politicians\u2019 campaigns here, \nhave the lobbying power they need to destabilize the \ninternational financial system. Is that not remarkable? \nAnd such a short time has elapsed between Paul \nO\u2019Neill\u2019s assertion and what we are saying today. \n\nWe are not asking for anything. We just want to \nbe allowed to pay. It is remarkable. We started by \ndefaulting on our debt and now they will not let us \npay it back. It seems almost absurd, in a world that is \ngrappling with debt restructuring involving millions of \nmen and women. Even here in the United States, there \nare men and women who are unemployed and have lost \ntheir homes, not to speak of the devastation we see in \nEurope. \n\nObviously, Argentina and many of the countries \nrepresented here today do not have the good fortune \nof being countries that issue reserve currencies, but \nwe have expressed our willingness to honour our \ncommitments. I think this should be recognized, \nunless the idea is to use a country like Argentina as an \nexample, because it was able to climb out of the hole, to \ncreate jobs and generate growth, and to pay its creditors \nwithout applying the prescriptions that the International \nMonetary Fund tried to impose upon it. \n\n\n\f\nIncidentally, there is also a need for global market \nregulation and market interventions. Wonderful \nstatements have been made in the Group of 20 regarding \ntax havens, ratings agencies and capital flows, but what \nis certain is that the world needs global laws for global \ngovernance. Just as we ask for Security Council and \nGeneral Assembly resolutions to be respected, we also \nask for rules and for respect for the sovereignty of \ncountries, especially those countries like ours that wish \nto honour their commitments. \n\nFinally, I would like to address the Assembly on \nthis very special day. Today we see war, human rights \nviolations and other violations intertwined. Perhaps \nsome are of a more subtle nature, such as losing one\u2019s \njob, one\u2019s rights, one\u2019s livelihood or one\u2019s hope. I think, \nat the core, our duty as world leaders is to build a truly \ndifferent history. \n\nMany of those who have already spoken have made \nsomewhat ambivalent statements. Some have been \nencouraging, while others have been disillusioned as a \nresult of not having been able to do what they wanted, \nalmost as if their desire to do something had just been \na whim, and when they were not allowed to, they grew \nfrustrated. I believe that the one thing we cannot do \nwhen we have the responsibility of governing and \nwhen we might be able to govern a country with a lot \nof power is to lose our temper or, even worse, make \nmistakes. Making mistakes is the one thing we should \nnot do, because mistakes are not paid for by the leaders \nwho make decisions or imperfect choices. Mistakes are \npaid for in human lives, not only if we are talking about \nwar, but also if we are talking about the economy. In \nthat case, they are paid for in terms of unemployment, \nlack of access to health care, education, housing and \nsecurity. \n\nThere is cheap labour available for drug trafficking, \nwhich we talk so much about fighting. One of the keys \nto fighting drug trafficking is to put an end to cheap \nlabour in emerging and underdeveloped countries. We \nmust also put an end to money-laundering for drug \ntrafficking in central countries, because the money \nis not laundered in the countries that produce the raw \nmaterials. Money-laundering takes place in the central \ncountries. It is right to say this, because we hear so \nmuch talk about drug trafficking and other things.\n\nI would conclude with a phrase by the Secretary-\nGeneral that I really liked. I thought his invitation was \nmost appropriate. It was specifically an invitation to \nturn hope into action through hard work, commitment, \ndignity and integrity. He ended with the words \u201cwith \npassion\u201d. I am a person with a lot of passion. Some say \nthat I am sometimes a bit too passionate and a bit too \nforceful in my statements. \u201cWith passion\u201d, he said, but \nabove all with compassion. He said that we can build \na future that the people want and the world needs with \npassion and compassion. \n\nIt is not the first time I have heard this word. I must \nconfess that I heard it many years ago, and very often, \nin my own country. Perhaps I did not understand it at \nthe time, this passion. It was used then, and is still used \ntoday, by a cardinal from Argentina who is today Pope \nand whom I would also like, as a Christian, to thank \nfor the key role he played in dealing with the question \nof Syria. Compassion and passion \u2014 that means the \npassionate embrace of hope, of the future, of the things \nthat are yet to come, and compassion for those who are \nless privileged, for the most vulnerable, for those who \nare waiting for so many things, who have done nothing \nto deserve extreme poverty and be Godforsaken, and \ncompassion for all those who are victims \u2014 of war, of \nunemployment, of extreme poverty and misery \u2014 in \nother words, of our own failures as world leaders.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour to join the Assembly \ntoday. I congratulate President Ashe on his election and \nsincerely thank the Secretary-General for his always \ninvaluable work.\n\nGlobal security will long be shaped by what is \nhappening right now in the Middle East. Our region can \nbe and must be a house of peace and prosperity, with \nstrong pillars of good governance and wide-open doors \nto opportunity, especially for our young people. That is \nJordan\u2019s blueprint, and we are not alone.\n\nBut no house can be built when its city is burning. \nAnd today, the region\u2019s fires cannot be ignored. All the \nworld is in their path. To protect the future, our world \nmust respond. The Syrian crisis is a global humanitarian \nand security disaster. Escalating violence threatens \nto hollow out the rest of that country\u2019s economic and \npolitical future. Extremists have rushed to promote and \nexploit ethnic and religious divisions. Such a dynamic \ncould crush regional renaissance and put global security \nat risk. We have a duty to reject those destructive forces.\n\nLast month, Jordan hosted more than 100 eminent \nMuslim scholars from around the world. Their work \naffirms the true teachings of Islam and builds on \nJordan\u2019s long-standing interfaith and intra-religious \ninitiatives: the Amman Message, A Common Word, \nand World Interfaith Harmony Week. \n\nThe scholars said that there was no single prescribed \nmodel for an Islamic State, but they affirmed that the \nmodern Islamic State should be a civic State, founded \non institutions and with an inclusive constitution based \non the rule of law, justice and freedom of opinion \nand faith. The modern Islamic State should uphold \nequality across the ethnic and religious spectrum. \nThe scholars decisively condemned the incitement of \nethnic and sectarian conflict, known in Arabic as fitna. \nThey recognized that evil for what it is \u2014 a threat \nto the Muslim world, the Ummah, and indeed to all \nhumankind. Jordan has called upon the Organization of \nIslamic Cooperation to adopt those recommendations, \nwhich are critical guiding principles amid the turbulence \nand transformations across our region.\n\nThis month, we in Jordan also convened an \ninternational meeting to address challenges to Arab \nChristian communities. They are an essential part of \nour region\u2019s past, present and future. Jordan has been \na historic model of coexistence and fraternity between \nMuslims and Christians. We will continue to do our \nutmost to protect our Arab Christian communities and \nminorities, and we call on all countries to join us in our \nstand for diversity, tolerance and mutual respect.\n\nThe truth is that respect for each other is the way \nforward for all of us. The historic transformation \ngoing on in my region today will not be achieved by \nformulas; it will come when all of our citizens feel \ntruly represented. Jordan seeks a house of the future \nthat includes all. We are building our future on the solid \nfoundation of majority consensus, minority rights, a \ndemocratic culture of active citizenship and peaceful, \nevolutionary change.\n\nThe Syrian people must also have a future. And \nfor that, the international community must act. It is \n\n\n\f\ntime to fast-track a political transition in Syria, end \nthe violence and bloodshed, neutralize the threat of \nchemical weapons, restore security and stability, \npreserve the unity of Syria and its territorial integrity, \nand engage all \u2014 all \u2014 of its people in building their \ncountry\u2019s future.\n\nSyria\u2019s future will depend on the Syrian people, but \nthe world has the duty, the interest and the power to help. \nAnd help must come soon. The damage and dangers \nare mounting. The flow of Syrian refugees into Jordan \nalready equals one-tenth of our own population. It could \nreach 1 million, some 20 per cent of our population, by \nnext year. These are not just numbers; they are people \nwho need food, water, shelter, sanitation, electricity, \nhealth care and more. \n\nNot even the strongest global economies could \nabsorb such demand on infrastructure and resources, \nlet alone a small economy and the fourth water-poorest \ncountry in the world. Jordanians have opened their arms \nto those in need, as we have always done, but I say here \nand now that my people cannot be asked to shoulder the \nburden of what is a regional and global challenge.\n\nLet me acknowledge, with gratitude, the generous \nresponse to date by the United Nations and regional and \ninternational donors. But we can all see the reality on \nthe ground; the need is outracing the response. More \nsupport is urgently needed to send a strong signal that \nthe world community stands shoulder to shoulder with \nthose who have borne so much. Those who are suffering \nin Syria also need the world to be resolute: the Syrian \nparties must abide by international humanitarian law \nand principles, and allow humanitarian access, into and \nwithin Syria, to reach those in need.\n\nOur international community must also work \ntogether for a speedy resolution of the region\u2019s core \ncrisis. The Palestinian-Israeli conflict consumes \nresources that are needed to build a better future and \nfeeds the flames of extremism around the world. It is \ntime to put this fire out.\n\nThe talks that began in July show that progress \ncan be made, with willing parties, determined United \nStates leadership and strong regional and international \nbacking. We commend the President of Palestine and \nthe Prime Minister of Israel for the bold decision to \nresume final status negotiations. We urge them to \nstay committed to reaching an agreement within the \nestablished time frame. Let there be no actions that \ncan derail what is still a fragile process. This means \nno continued settlement construction and no unilateral \nactions that threaten the status quo in East Jerusalem \nand its Muslim and Christian holy sites. Such threats \nwould be a flashpoint for global concern.\n\nWe know the right way forward. And the goal \ncan be reached. It includes a just and final two-State \nsettlement, based on international legitimacy and the \nArab Peace Initiative; for Israel, real security and \nnormal relations with 57 Arab and Muslim countries; \nfor the Palestinian people, at long last, the rights they \ndeserve in a viable and independent Palestinian State \non Palestinian national soil, based on the 1967 lines and \nwith East Jerusalem as its capital.\n\nLet us keep the focus on what we are \nbuilding \u2014 communities safe for families to lead \nnormal lives; a Middle East of many houses, working \ntogether in region-wide cooperation; the ultimate \nsecurity for our future.\n\nThe future is ours to build, not in the Middle \nEast alone, but in global partnership. Those who are \nworking to do the right thing need the whole world\u2019s \nsupport. With every country that is more prosperous \nand free, with every neighbourhood that is safer, with \nevery person who has more reason to hope, the entire \nhouse of humankind grows more secure. Let this be our \npromise, not only for future generations, but for those \nwe serve today.\n"

        "file_text": "The world is constantly \nchanging and the pace of change is increasing every \nyear. The world is a very different place today compared \nto 10 years ago when the Millennium Development \nGoals were set. But it is important to understand the \nnature of the changes and to draw the right conclusions, \nbecause only then will we be able to have an influence \nand shape our own future.\n\nWe are seeing the fastest reduction in poverty in \nhuman history. Child death rates have fallen, meaning \nthat 14,000 fewer children are dying every day. Deaths \nfrom malaria and tuberculosis are decreasing. New \nHIV infections are declining. People are living longer. \nOne hundred years ago, the average life expectancy in \nSweden was less than 60 years. Today, many children \nborn in my country will live to celebrate their 100th \nbirthday. Those are truly amazing developments.\n\nThe world economy is growing. This year, \ndeveloping and emerging countries\u2019 share of the world \neconomy will surpass the share of developed countries. \nIn 10 years\u2019 time, they will dominate the growing world \neconomy.\n\nWe see the same pattern in expanding global trade \nflows. The share of developing countries\u2019 exports \nhas grown substantially and now accounts for almost \nhalf of all exports in the world. That creates jobs and \ngrowth for everyone and increases global equality. \nTechnological change is also rapid. Seeking information \nfrom the other side of the globe is now part of everyday \nlife for many people, not only for the privileged few. As \nan example, the number of mobile phone users has risen \nfrom fewers than 1 billion to more than 6 billion. But \nchallenges are still abundant, and it is crucial that we \nintensify our efforts to achieve the existing Millennium \nDevelopment Goals.\n\nSweden continues to contribute 1 per cent of its gross \nnational income to official development assistance. \nSweden is a firm believer in multilateral organizations, \nin international cooperation and in the United Nations. \nThe United Nations plays a key role in coordinating our \nefforts towards the Millennium Development Goals. We \nbelieve that together we can become hopeful instead of \nhelpless. Therefore, Sweden contributes approximately \n$1.2 billion yearly to the United Nations system. That \nmakes us the second biggest contributor per capita to \nthe United Nations in the world \u2014 that is something we \nare very proud of.\n\nIn addition to the existing Millennium Development \nGoals, we must also work to establish a strong post-\n2015 development agenda, with the objective of \neradicating extreme poverty, raising standards of \nliving for everyone and offering equal opportunities \nto everyone. In that regard, I would like to draw the \nAssembly\u2019s attention to the three areas that I believe are \ncentral to human and economic development: gender \nequality, democracy and free trade. Those areas have \nthe capacity to influence developments in many other \nareas at the same time. \n\nWhen I addressed the General Assembly two \nyears ago (see A/66/PV.19), I spoke about the most \nimportant human rights failure of all \u2014 the one that \naffects the largest number of human beings, namely \ngender inequality. I want to raise that issue once again, \nbecause that challenge is as present and as urgent today \nas before.\n\nGender equality is first and foremost a question \nof ensuring the same human, economic and social \nrights for half of the world\u2019s population, something that \nshould be self-evident. Every year, 1 billion women are \nstill subject to sexual or physical violence. Women are \nstill refused equal access to health services, including \nsexual and reproductive health and rights. Every day \n800 women still die from preventable complications \nrelated to pregnancy and childbirth. Legal restrictions \nstill exist preventing women from owning, inheriting \nand acquiring property in many countries. Many girls \nand women are still refused access to schools and \neducation. For many women the idea that a Government \nwould have more female than male ministers, like in \nSweden, seems utopian. Many of those women are not \neven allowed to vote.\n\nAgainst that background, Sweden was one of the \ncountries that gave strong support to creating the entity \nUN-Women and is today one of its biggest donors. It \nis our firm belief that by ensuring gender equality one \nalso improves a country\u2019s productivity and economy \nand the rule of law. Educating girls and women leads \ndirectly to an increase in a country\u2019s economic output. \nEducated mothers place higher value on schooling for \ntheir children. Closing the gap between male and female \nemployment rates increases a country\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct substantially. Increased participation by women \nin politics and business leads to clear improvements for \n\n\n\f\nthe public good and to less corruption. The inclusion \nof women in peace processes makes peace easier and \nmore stable. Let me be very clear: it is simply neither \nacceptable nor very smart to discriminate against \nwomen and girls.\n\nTo achieve sustainable development, we need \na democratic governance that encompasses all \nindividuals. We need a system that covers not only \nthe State, but also the private sector and civil society \norganizations. We need a governing system that is \naccountable and transparent with regard to its actions. \nNevertheless, nearly one third of the world\u2019s population \nlives under authoritarian rule, a serious barrier to \ndevelopment. With the growing economic power in \nmany developing countries comes an opportunity and \na responsibility to use that power wisely and for the \ncommon good of everyone. \n\nEvery person\u2019s human rights must be respected, \nregardless of origin, religion, handicap, gender, sexual \npreference or transsexual identity. Only then will \nsociety reap the benefits of all human resources. Only \nwhen people can freely express their political opinions \nand freely participate in a thriving civil society can \nthey truly participate in the lives of their communities. \nThat also applies to freedom on the Internet. Only \nwith functioning courts do people feel safe to make \ninvestments and develop their businesses. Only with \nrespect for the rule of law can we tackle organized \ncrime and corruption. Only with democratic principles \ncan we ensure freedom from conflict and violence.\n\nViolence and oppression in all their forms are \namong the main threats to the development of people \nand the development of societies. We know that it takes, \non average, seven years to fight a civil war, and 17 years \nto recover from a war. That is why conflict is sometimes \ncalled \u201cdevelopment in reverse\u201d. As we speak, there \nare several major ongoing conflicts, resulting in death \nand suffering, hunger and disease, and rape and sexual \nviolence. Those conflicts are depriving men, women \nand children of their right to a prosperous life and a \nfuture of hope. A focus on fragile States will remain \nnecessary.\n\nThe civil war raging in Syria for more than two \nyears must come to an end. Those responsible for \nsystematic violations of human rights, including those \nresponsible for the use of chemical weapons, must \nbe held accountable. The conflict must, however, be \nhandled within the United Nations system. There is an \nurgent need for a political solution to the conflict and a \ntransition to a free and democratic Syria.\n\nIt is time for a new era in which countries in \nconflict can join the rest of the world in achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals. For that, we need a \nstrong United Nations and a well-functioning Security \nCouncil.\n\nI want to thank all peacekeepers and peacebuilders \nof the United Nations for their efforts and sacrifices. \nSweden will further contribute to and participate \nin those efforts. We also give strong support to the \nareas of democracy, human rights and freedom from \nviolence. Sweden is one of biggest donors to the Office \nof the High Commissioner for Human Rights. We are \ntrying to help out though humanitarian assistance for \nthe crisis in Syria and by receiving refugees. This year \nalone we have welcomed 16,000 Syrians to Sweden.\n\nLet me mention a third area that we need to focus on \nin the post-2015 development agenda, namely, trade and \ncompetition. Protectionism is very expensive. It raises \nprices and lowers standards of living. Let me illustrate \nthis by a striking example. According to the World \nTrade Organization, consumers and Governments in \nrich countries pay $350 billion per year supporting \nagriculture. That is enough to fly their 41 million dairy \ncows first class around the world.\n\nAllow me to mention some other, maybe more down-\nto-earth, examples. When competition was introduced \nfor mobile phone companies in some countries, the \ncost of calls fell by 30 to 50 per cent. Studies show that \nlowering service barriers by one third under the Doha \nDevelopment Agenda would raise developing countries\u2019 \nincomes by approximately $60 billion. Unfortunately, \nprogress in the Doha Development Round has been \nslow. But the good news is that many countries are \ndoing what they can to liberalize trade through regional \nagreements instead, because they know that that will \nbenefit their economies.\n\nThe two free trade agreements now being \nnegotiated \u2014 between the United States and the \nEuropean Union and between the United States and a \nnumber of countries in Asia and Latin America \u2014 will \ncover two-thirds of world trade. That will create jobs \nand growth. Sweden is one of the countries within \nthe European Union working the hardest to get the \ntransatlantic deal in place. Freer trade and openness \nalso mean that new impulses and trends affect a country \nfaster. That puts pressure on reform in countries and \n\n\n\f\ncompanies to meet global competition. Sweden is an \nexample of that.\n\nTrade has made it possible for us to double our \neconomic output. Our companies have learned that they \nmust consistently take on new trends and technology \nin order to stay competitive. If they did not, our gross \ndomestic product and standard of living would fall \nsignificantly. Let us also remember how important \ntrade is for peaceful relations. To put it very simply, \nno sales person wants to start a war against a country \nwhere he has customers. That would be a bad business \nstrategy, so trade promotes peace.\n\nClimate change continues, leading to extreme \nweather conditions in many parts of the world and \nthe loss of lives and very high costs for society. The \nEuropean Union\u2019s and the United States\u2019 emissions are \nfalling, but overall global emissions are increasing. \nThat is why all countries need to contribute to the \ninternational efforts in the fight against climate change. \nThe European Union and the United States cannot solve \nthe problem of climate change on their own, when \nthey only account for around 25 per cent of today\u2019s \nemissions.\n\nThe international structures we have to deal \nwith climate change commitments are unfortunately \nobsolete. We need a new agreement that ensures that all \nmajor emitters make commitments that are sufficient \nso that we can reach the two-degree target.\n\nIt is our duty to strive for a society and a world \nthat gives everybody the possibility to create his or \nher own future. That is what every woman, every man, \nevery girl and every boy deserves. Let me underline \nthat it is in the very interests of every country, because \npeople are the real wealth of a nation. The Millennium \nDevelopment Goals have been very successful in \ncoordinating and focusing our efforts on the areas where \nprogress has been most urgent. Now we need to prepare \nfor tomorrow. In doing that, Sweden is convinced, the \nUnited Nations will play a very important role. We will \ncontinue our strong support to the Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "It is my distinct honour \nand pleasure to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your \nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-eighth session. The Caribbean Community \n(CARICOM) Heads of Government, at their thirty-\nfourth meeting in July, pledged their support for your \npresidency. Allow me therefore to assure you of my \ndelegation\u2019s support throughout the current session \nof the General Assembly. Let me also commend your \npredecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremi., for ably guiding the \nwork of the General Assembly during its sixty-seventh \nsession.\n\nYou have assumed leadership of the General \nAssembly at a very pivotal moment in the United Nations \ntimetable. The expiration deadline for the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals is near, and our efforts to elaborate \nan agenda for the post-2015 period are intensifying. \nFollowing the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment, modifications have been made to the \ninstitutional framework for sustainable development. \nAn agreement has been reached on the establishment \nof the High-level Political Forum and the United \nNations Environment Assembly. The deliberations on \nthe reform of the Economic and Social Council have \nbeen completed. It is envisaged that the deliberations of \nthe Open Working Group on Sustainable Development \nGoals and the intergovernmental committee of experts \non sustainable development financing will accelerate \nin the next few months. The international community \ncontinues to chart a course in the pursuit of global \nsustainable development.\n\nThe theme of the sixty-eighth session of the General \nAssembly, \u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: setting \nthe stage\u201d, will require us to engage in what might best \nbe described as a retrospective and prospective dialogue. \nMuch has been said about the current global financial \nand economic crisis, which has been made worse by \nthe many manifestations of the impact of climate \nchange \u2014 extreme weather events, food crises and \nvolatile food crises \u2014 compounded by unprecedented \nlevels of terror and violence. At the same time, we have \nseen a global determination to tackle these issues.\n\nBarbados recognizes that the stability, health and \nproductivity of the global environment, particularly \ncoastal and marine resources, are fundamental to the \n\n\n\f\nsurvival of Barbados, CARICOM and other small \nisland developing States (SIDS). We therefore deem \nit imperative that countries like ours maintain active \ninvolvement in shaping the global development \npolicy agenda. It is recognized, however, that SIDS \nare constrained in their ability and capacity to craft \nindependent solutions. One major barrier is our debt \nsituation.\n\nThe issue of debt sustainability is of particular \nrelevance to SIDS. In highlighting its importance, the \nPrime Minister of Barbados, in his feature address \nto the recently concluded interregional preparatory \nmeeting for the Third International Conference on the \nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing \nStates, noted:\n\n\u201cDebt sustainability is a critical issue not only \nfor Barbados, but for many of the SIDS... We must \ntherefore use the opportunity provided by the \nThird International Conference on SIDS to both \nfind and share solutions to this challenge, as it is \na major constraint to SIDS achieving sustainable \ndevelopment.\n\u201cIn this context, it is imperative that, before \nwe meet in Samoa, an opportunity be provided \nto fully ventilate this matter. In this regard, the \nrelevant entity of the United Nations responsible \nfor coordinating SIDS issues may want to consider \nconvening a meeting of the Finance and Economic \nMinisters of SIDS to discuss this issue and to put \nforward specific recommendations to be considered \nas part of the outcome of the Third International \nmeeting on SIDS.\u201d\nI repeat that call on this body and commend it to the \nrelevant entity of the United Nations system to act \nexpeditiously on this proposal.\nAnother issue of concern to Barbados relates to the \ninternational financial-services sector. We believe that \nthe sustainability of our development is being stymied \nby efforts to undermine this very important sector, \nwhich continues to provide a stable and substantial \ncontribution to our gross domestic product. Barbados \ntherefore associates itself with the comments of the \nRight Honourable Perry Christie, Prime Minister of the \nBahamas, in his address to the General Assembly (see \nA/68/PV.19). We are a well-regulated jurisdiction which \nhas sought at all times to comply with international \nrules and best practice, and it is our intention to operate \nwithin the established international norms that have \nguided this sector to date.\n\nIn 1994, Barbados was honoured to host the first \nUnited Nations Global Conference on the Sustainable \nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. At \nthat time, we were optimistic that the international \ncommunity\u2019s recognition of the inherent vulnerabilities \nof small States would lead to real progress in the \ndevelopment of SIDS. However, the five-year review of \nthe Mauritius Strategy in 2010 revealed that\n\n\u201c[s]mall island developing States have made \nless progress than most other groupings, or even \nregressed, in economic terms, especially in terms \nof poverty reduction and debt sustainability\u201d \n(resolution 65/2, para. 5).\nDespite this, Barbados remains committed to the \nprocess to advance the sustainable development of \nSIDS.\nAs you are aware, Mr. President, Barbados attaches \ngreat importance to sustainable development in all its \ndimensions. We believe that the theme for this year\u2019s \nsession \u2014 \u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: setting \nthe stage\u201d \u2014 is thus both timely and important. Such \nan agenda must recognize the importance of addressing \nthe very specific needs of the Members of the United \nNations. I speak therefore from the perspective of SIDS.\n\nBarbados believes that the post-2015 development \nagenda should involve commitments to the eradication \nof poverty and hunger; environmental sustainability, \nwith a strong emphasis on coastal and marine resources; \nthe development of sustainable and accessible renewable \nenergy technologies; the pursuit of a sustainable \nagriculture agenda, in tandem with food and nutrition \nsecurity; gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment; \nand youth development, education and employment.\n\nWe also call for emphasis on the inclusion of \nvulnerable groups, including persons with disabilities; \nthe requisite means of implementation, including \ncapacity-building, technology transfer, trade and \ntechnical cooperation; the integration of appropriate \nsystems for accountability, monitoring, evaluation and \nreporting; and good governance, respect for human \nrights, and the rule of law.\n\nThis is not a mere shopping list. It reflects the \nunderstanding that all these issues are inextricably \nlinked. They represent challenges or problems that \nmust be tackled simultaneously, if we are to achieve \n\n\n\f\nsustainable development. These cannot be addressed in \na silo-like manner.\n\nThe importance of a policy of sustainable \ndevelopment can therefore not be understated. It \nis a matter of survival. It is for this reason that the \nGovernment of Barbados has envisioned the building \nof a green economy as its strategy for advancing its \nsustainable development. As Prime Minister Freundel \nStuart indicated in the foreword to the Green Economy: \nScoping Study Synthesis Report on Barbados,\n\n\u201cthe Green Economy debate recognizes our \nstructural vulnerabilities, offers a model to assist \nus in further realizing our sustainable development \naspirations, and creates the institutional platform \nthat would enable us to participate in innovative \npartnerships in the fight to save our planet, \nagainst mounting unsustainable consumption and \nproduction patterns\u201d.\nOur situation as a special case for development \nholds as true today as it did more than 20 years ago, \nwhen the United Nations system first acknowledged \nour vulnerabilities and our special link to ocean \nresources. In the case of Barbados, we are of the \nopinion that a green economy is inextricably linked to \nour development and as such should not be lost in this \nvery important discussion.\n\nOver the past several months, increasing attention \nhas been focused on the preparatory process for the \nThird International Conference on the Sustainable \nDevelopment of SIDS, to be held in Samoa in 2014. \nThree regional preparatory meetings in the various \nSIDS regions were convened in July. Members may \nrecall that the interregional meeting was held in my \ncountry, Barbados, the birthplace of the Programme \nof Action for the Sustainable Development of Small \nIsland Developing States \u2014 the Barbados Programme \nof Action.\n\nBarbados attaches great importance to the \npreparatory process for the Samoa Conference. As we \ntake stock after almost 20 years of the implementation \nof the Programme of Action and 10 years of the \nMauritius Strategy for its further implementation, \nwe wish to emphasize that this process is an integral \npart of the overall post-2015 development agenda. \nThis preparatory process can strengthen the collective \naction of SIDS in addressing their vulnerabilities and \nspecial development challenges. Prime Minister Stuart \nof Barbados referred to this recently as building SIDS \ncollectivity.\n\nThe support of the international community \nmust underpin this concept of SIDS collectivity \nby strengthening interregional and intraregional \ncollaboration between SIDS and the various \nSIDS regions, and increasing emphasis on \ninstitution-building, including the establishment of an \nappropriate institutional mechanism to facilitate, in \nparticular, intraregional collaboration among SIDS.\n\nCredence is given to this approach by the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s High-level Panel on Global Sustainability, \nwhose report (see A/66/700) stressed that the building \nof effective institutional governance at the local, \nnational, regional and global levels is essential for \nachieving sustainable development, facilitating greater \nutilization of science and technology to help address \nmany of the issues being faced by our young people \nin strengthening the interface between youth talent, \ninnovation and entrepreneurship, and speaking with \none voice at the international level on issues impacting \nSIDS sustainable development.\n\nBarbados believes firmly that South-South and \ntriangular cooperation must be part of any effort \nto reform the existing international development \ncooperation architecture and to build more inclusive \nglobal partnerships for effective development \ncooperation. We possess a wealth of experience in areas \nthat we can share with developing and middle-income \ncountries, including education and training, health \ncare, social partnering, clean -nergy policies and \ntechnologies, environmental protection, including \ncoastal conservation, and the provision of social safety \nnets.\n\nLike other SIDS, however, we are constrained \nby limited financial resources and the persistent and \nprolonged global financial crisis, which continue to \nhave a negative impact on resource mobilization and \nfinancial flows to developing countries. Barbados \nsupports the observation made by the United Nations \nOffice for South-South Cooperation, that there is a need \nto give the global South the incentive to invest more \nin multilateral forms of South-South cooperation. We \ntherefore welcome the formation of partnerships with \nthe private sector, international organizations, donors \nand civil society organizations specifically designed to \nbetter facilitate such South-South cooperation.\n\n\n\f\nThere is a clear need for greater equity, fairness \nand transparency in the method employed to \ndetermine socioeconomic classifications and resource \nallocation. The persistent use of arbitrarily determined \ninternational classification and ratings systems that are \nbased on gross domestic product per capita and other \nnarrow criteria must be expanded in scope to take into \naccount meaningful variables such as vulnerability.\n\nIn this context, we refer again to the observation \nby the Secretary-General that gross domestic product \nper capita on its own is an inadequate indicator. We \nalso applaud the useful research being conducted on \nvulnerability indices and other measures beyond gross \ndomestic product by bodies such as the Commonwealth, \nthe Economic Commission for Latin America and \nthe Caribbean, and the United Nations Statistical \nCommission. Barbados will continue its advocacy on \nthis issue.\n\nBarbados is not unique. Like other SIDS, we \nrecognize that our efforts to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment must of necessity incorporate delivery \nmodalities encompassing finance, good governance, \ndevelopment cooperation, trade capacity-building and \ninstitutional strengthening. Barbados therefore reminds \nthis body that we must foster strong partnerships if we \nare to craft effective and truly lasting global solutions.\n\nWe call on Member States to revisit the Small Island \nDeveloping States Technical Assistance Programme as \na means of enabling the transfer of skills, knowledge \nand experience across SIDS and the three SIDS \nregions. We hold the view that the Programme offers \nmuch potential for enhancing capacity and access to \nSIDS-grown technologies and skill sets. The Technical \nAssistance Programme must be seen as an important \nmechanism for advancing the post-2015 development \nagenda.\n\nThe provision of free health care for Barbadian \ncitizens has been a critical contributor to the high level \nof human development in Barbados. The treatment and \nprevention of chronic non-communicable diseases, \nhowever, account for a disproportionately large \npercentage of our national budget. That has entailed \nthe diversion of scarce resources that should have been \ndevoted to achieving other development goals. Chronic \nnon-communicable diseases constitute one of the major \nchallenges to the sustainable development of Barbados, \neffectively threatening the development gains that \nBarbados has made.\n\nOur strong commitment to preventing and combating \nchronic non-communicable diseases is reflected in \nstrong multi-stakeholder partnerships, including the \ndedicated engagement of civil society. Despite the \nnational prioritization of non-communicable diseases, \nthe focus on prevention, and the implementation of \nevidence-based programmes, a developing country \nlike Barbados cannot, on its own, achieve its national \nobjectives. International cooperation and assistance in \nthis area are critical.\n\nMy country does not draw a dividing line between \nits domestic and foreign policies. We have been blessed \nwith stable Governments. We have enjoyed a tradition \nof constitutional change in our Governments since \nindependence. As a nation, we have striven to create \na just society. We see an inextricable link between \ndevelopment and international peace and security. \nWithout development, there can be no international \npeace and security, and without international peace and \nsecurity the development agenda will not succeed.\n\nFor Barbados, therefore, the rule of law at the \nnational and international levels is an indispensable \ncondition for sustainable development. Barbados is \ndeeply concerned by the number of national regional \nand international conflicts raging throughout the \nworld. We are yet more concerned that the threshold \nof what constitutes an acceptable level of violence and \nacceptable levels of atrocity grows higher and higher. \nThe findings of the United Nations inspection team that \nchemical weapons were used in Syria are alarming. My \ncountry believes that the perpetrators of these acts must \nbe brought to account. Moreover, we believe that the \ninternational community must work in good faith to \nfind a political solution to the escalating and ongoing \nhumanitarian crisis in Syria.\n\nAt the same time, the international community \nmust not lose sight of the many conflicts and acts of \nterror that continue throughout the world. Against this \nbackground my delegation wishes to extend profound \ncondolences to the Government and the people of Kenya \non the recent terrorist attacks that were perpetrated \nagainst the people of that country. As we have stated, \nthere can be no justification for acts of terror.\n\nIn Barbados and the Caribbean, illicit small arms \nand light weapons are the weapons of mass destruction. \nPrimarily linked to international drug trafficking and \nother transnational organized crime, the proliferation \nof illicit small arms and light weapons in the Caribbean \n\n\n\f\nexacts a heavy toll on State and citizen security and \nimpairs national development. For that reason, Barbados \nand CARICOM consistently argued for the elaboration \nof a robust, legally binding Arms Trade Treaty, which \nwould set the highest common international standards \nfor regulating the transfer of conventional arms. \nBarbados is pleased, therefore, to be among those \nMember States that have signed the Arms Trade Treaty. \nIt is our hope that the implementation of the Treaty will \nlead to a reduction in the flow of illicit small arms, light \nweapons and their ammunition, parts and components, \nthus contributing to a reduction in armed conflict and \nviolence.\n\nOur first Prime Minister, now a national hero, the \nRight Excellent Errol Walton Barrow, in his maiden \nspeech to this body on 9 December 1966, stated:\n\n\u201cWe have no quarrels to pursue and we \nparticularly insist that we do not regard any \nMember State as our natural opponent... We will \nnot regard any great Power as necessarily right in a \ngiven dispute unless we are convinced of this, yet \nat the same time, we will not view the great Powers \nwith perennial suspicion.\u201d (A/PV.1487, para. 78)\nThe United Nations was established in the aftermath \nof the Second World War to promote international \npeace and security. We call on the Security Council \nto meet its obligations to the international community. \nIt is clear that there cannot be business as usual while \nhumanitarian crises continue to emerge and countless \nlives continue to be lost. My delegation therefore \nremains concerned about the economic embargo \nthat continues to be imposed on Cuba, as well as the \nextraterritorial impact that it continues to have on \ncountries inside and outside our region. We call for the \nending of the embargo and trust that it will soon be \nushered into the pages of history.\n\nMy delegation looks forward to the further \nunfolding of the post-2015 development agenda during \nthis sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly, and \nI wish you, Sir, every success as you guide the General \nAssembly in realizing an agenda that is inclusive and \none that will redound to the benefit of all.\n"

        "file_text": "In the twenty-first \ncentury, old distinctions between North and South, and \ndeveloped and developing countries are beginning to \nlose their meaning. We are witnessing significant shifts \nin the geopolitical balance, in population dynamics \nand in economic power between Member States. As \ndocumented in this year\u2019s United Nations Human \nDevelopment Report, many developing countries \nare experiencing faster economic growth. Emerging \neconomies now produce the majority of the world\u2019s \ngoods and services, and three quarters of the world\u2019s \neconomic growth is said to depend on their dynamism.\n\nToday, emerging economies and middle-income \ncountries are an important part of reshaping the global \neconomy. In a globalized world, with dramatic shifts of \npower and influence, a strong United Nations is more \nrelevant than ever before. We need the United Nations, \nwith its unique legitimacy and its universal membership. \nWe need a United Nations that can contribute to global \nchallenges with common solutions. We need a United \nNations that reflects the changing political landscape, \nincluding through a reformed Security Council. Above \nall, we need a United Nations that can help to mediate, \nprevent and resolve armed conflicts. For the United \nNations to be able to contribute effectively to resolving \narmed conflicts, it is crucial that the Security Council \nshow leadership and prove that it can fulfil its primary \npurpose and responsibility of cooperating to resolve \ninternational crises and to promote universal respect \nfor human rights.\n\nToday, the total number of people uprooted by \nconflict or persecution is close to 45 million, the \nhighest level in 18 years. That illustrates the human \nsuffering and costs of conflict, which we must do our \nutmost to prevent and resolve. An integrated approach \nto preventive diplomacy, peacebuilding, peacekeeping \nand the prevention of atrocities is crucial. The cure for \narmed conflict and instability is to invest in democratic \n\n\n\f\nstructures that protect civilians and their human rights \nand contribute to socioeconomic progress. In recent \nyears, the Security Council has increasingly integrated \nthe rule of law, human rights and the protection \nof civilians into its mandates for United Nations \npeacekeeping and peacebuilding missions. That is an \nencouraging development that Denmark supports fully.\n\nDenmark agrees with the Secretary-General that \nbuilding societies that are resilient to crimes of atrocity \nincreases the prospects of long-term peace and stability. \nThe unacceptable human suffering in Syria is a tragic \nreminder of the consequences when no early action to \nprevent crimes of atrocity is undertaken. Advancing \nthe primary responsibility of States to protect their \npopulations should be a concern for all Governments. \nThe responsibility to protect is consistent with existing \nobligations and international human rights law, \nhumanitarian law and refugee law, which are binding \non all States. Denmark calls on Member States to join \nthe global network of responsibility-to-protect focal \npoints, which works to integrate the prevention of \natrocities in national policies, and to engage with other \nMember States and regional organizations in order \nto build capacity and cooperation before crises and \nconflicts break out.\n\nAt the same time, we must ensure accountability \nfor human rights violations and for crimes of atrocity \nin the past. The perpetrators of those crimes must be \nbrought to justice. While the Security Council last \nFriday took an important step to address the crisis in \nSyria, Denmark reiterates its call on the Council to refer \nthe case of Syria to the International Criminal Court.\n\nSexual violence in conflict is one of the most \npersistent injustices in the world today, and often one \nof the most neglected. We must combat sexual violence \nas a method of warfare. Likewise, we must promote the \nparticipation of women in peacebuilding and in social \nand economic recovery. Denmark strongly believes \nthat no durable peace can be attained without the full \nand equal participation of women in peacekeeping and \npeacebuilding processes.\n\nBuilding sustainable peace and long-term stability \nremains one of the most difficult challenges for the \ninternational community and the United Nations. \nBut the investment is well worth it. We must support \ncountry-led and country-owned transition strategies \nin building paths towards resilient societies. Conflict \nand violence have devastating effects on development. \nThe complex situation in fragile States represents \nperhaps the greatest challenge to combating poverty, as \nlow-income fragile States are those most off-track in \nterms of reaching the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). It is therefore essential that the central roles \nof State-building and peacebuilding be duly reflected \nin the post-2015 framework.\n\nThe New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States, \nled by the g7+ countries, provides peacebuilding \nand State-building goals that call for a global effort \nto strengthen people\u2019s security, to reduce violence, \nto increase people\u2019s access to justice, to generate \nemployment and to improve livelihoods. We urge that \nthe experiences and lessons learned from the New Deal \nbecome a source of inspiration for discussions on the \npost-2015 development framework.\n\nThe process of establishing the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda should result in a single universal \nframework with one set of goals that can unite the world \nin a strong effort to eradicate extreme poverty, promote \nsustainable development and ensure all people the \nright to a better life. Denmark welcomes the outcome \ndocument of the High-level Meeting of the General \nAssembly on the Realization of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and other Internationally Agreed \nDevelopment Goals for Persons with Disabilities \n(resolution 68/3), adopted last week, which provides a \nfirst important step towards that vision.\n\nAt the same time, unfinished business from the \nMDGs must figure prominently in the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda. The focus should be on ending \nextreme poverty in one generation while promoting \nsustainable development in all its dimensions. The \nempowerment of women and girls and access to basic \nservices, such as health and education, must not drop \noff the agenda. On the contrary, we must commit to \ndoing more to close those gaps.\n\nDenmark is committed to shouldering its share of \ncollective responsibility. In 2012, Denmark provided \n0.83 per cent of its gross national income as official \ndevelopment assistance, and it has been fulfilling the \ninternational target of 0.7 per cent since 1978. Also, we \nare strengthening our efforts to work in partnership with \nprivate business and other non-State actors to increase \ninvestments in developing countries, especially in \nAfrica.\n\nAs also highlighted by the Secretary-General and \nthe High-level Panel on the Post-2015 Development \nAgenda in their reports, a new, coherent post-2015 \n\n\n\f\nframework must be firmly anchored in human rights \nas universal values and enablers for sustainable \ndevelopment. Such a framework must build on the core \nprinciples that underpin the international human rights \nframework, namely, participation, accountability, \ntransparency and non-discrimination. It must address \nthe human rights of all groups in our societies and pay \nspecial attention to the rights of indigenous peoples.\n\nWe are losing ground when it comes to inequality \nwithin countries where we see a widening gap between \nrich and poor people. The 1.2 billion poorest people \naccount for only 1 per cent of world consumption, while \nthe billion richest consume 72 per cent. Inequalities \nand their underlying causes must be addressed in the \npost-2015 development agenda in order to effectively \neradicate extreme poverty, underpin socioeconomic \nprogress and prevent instability.\n\nGender-based discrimination, including the denial \nof the rights of women and girls, remains the single \nmost widespread driver of inequalities in today\u2019s world. \nFor Denmark, it is critical that gender equality and \nsexual and reproductive health and rights be reflected \nin the post-2015 agenda. That was also underscored by \nthe High-level Panel report.\n\nMacroeconomic policy is essential in addressing \ninequalities. Equitable socioeconomic progress and \na fair distribution of resources are important for \ndeveloped and developing countries alike.\n\nScientific evidence, as just presented by the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, makes it \nclear that climate change has become a threat multiplier. \nMore frequent natural disasters impact on the most \nvulnerable people and add another layer to fragility, \ninequality and instability. Unsustainable production and \nconsumption increase the stress on natural resources \nand ecosystems. The level of carbon dioxide emissions \ntoday is 46 per cent higher than the 1990 level. The \nUnited Nations and its Member States must promote \ninnovative technologies and new solutions to water, \nfood and energy scarcity, deforestation and high carbon \nemissions. Jointly, we must push the transformation to \na green economy.\n\nGreen growth is necessary if we are to deal \neffectively with increased demands for resources over \nthe next 15 to 20 years as the global population grows. \nGreen growth is about opportunities for all, not about \nobstacles for some. The access to and management of \nenergy and water resources are two important elements. \nGovernments cannot do it alone. We need active \ninvolvement and a close partnership with the private \nsector, including businesses and private foundations, as \nwell as with civil society and public institutions.\n\nWe welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s invitation to \na summit in September 2014 that will serve to maintain \nthe momentum of the climate negotiations. It is crucial \nto set an ambitious international agenda for tackling \nthe consequences of climate change. Denmark\u2019s long-\nterm energy policy goal is clear: our entire energy \nsupply should be covered by renewable energy by \n2050. Denmark stands ready to support a global agenda \ntowards limiting global warming to 2\u00b0 Celsius. Our \ncontribution to the Secretary-General\u2019s Sustainable \nEnergy for All initiative is part of that support, including \nthe establishment of an energy efficiency hub in the \nnew United Nations City in Copenhagen. Denmark will \nalso work for an ambitious and operational outcome of \nthe the third International Conference on Small Island \nDeveloping States, to take place in September 2014.\n\nAt the country level, Denmark supports a United \nNations that can inspire change and deliver concrete \nresults that will benefit populations, strengthen their \nconfidence in political processes and pave the way for \nlong-term stability and development.\n\nWe condemn the indiscriminate violence that \nwe witness in Syria. Not only does it harm civilians \nin the most tragic way, it also undermines regional \nstability as a whole. With the conflict in Syria, we are \nconfronted with a humanitarian crisis of unprecedented \nproportions. Last month the world witnessed a further \nescalation of the conflict with the horrendous chemical \nattack in Ghouta. Denmark strongly condemns all use of \nchemical weapons, and we are convinced that a strong \ninternational reaction is required. It is crucial that those \nresponsible for that grave violation of international law \nbe brought to justice and that future use of chemical \nweapons be effectively prevented.\n\nFrom the very outset of the tragedy in Syria, \nDenmark has emphasized the need for a political \nsolution to end the human suffering. We welcome the \nadoption by the Security Council of resolution 2118 \n(2013), on the destruction of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons. \nDenmark continues to strongly support the efforts \ntowards the \u201cGeneva II\u201d conference.\n\nIn Egypt, an already fragile situation has worsened \nsignificantly over the past months, during which \ntragic events have led to a heavy loss of civilian \n\n\n\f\nlives. Democracy and dialogue must return. Progress \nin Egypt can come about only through a peaceful, \ninclusive process. Many challenges still lie ahead \nwith regard to the implementation of the road map for \na return to democratic and civilian rule in Egypt. We \nurge the Egyptian authorities to accept the support \nof the international community for that process. The \nUnited Nations can play an important role in supporting \nrespect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law.\n\nProgress in the Middle East peace process remains \ncritical for improving regional stability. Denmark \nwelcomes the United States initiative aimed at resumed \ndirect negotiations. All parties must now truly seize \nthe opportunity for peace and work constructively for a \nsustainable two-State solution.\n\nIn Afghanistan, we welcome the process towards \nfull national ownership, which is crucial for the long-\nterm future of the country. Afghan authorities are \ntaking over still-greater responsibility for security \nand institutions. There is, however, a clear need for \na continued, strong political commitment from the \ninternational community in order for Afghanistan \nto succeed in that goal. The Afghan Government \nand its international partners must live up to the \nJuly 2012 Tokyo declaration on partnership for self-\nreliance in Afghanistan. Denmark will remain a strong \npartner to Afghanistan on its way to democracy and \nimproved livelihoods. The United Nations assistance \nto Afghanistan in managing the transition process, \nincluding the upcoming electoral processes, will be \nessential now and in the years to come.\n\nPeace and security in the Sahel region have lately \nbeen challenged by violent extremism, the presence of \narmed groups, the expansion of transborder organized \ncrime and increasing environmental and climate-change \npressures, which jeopardize development gains. \nDenmark supports the implementation of the United \nNations integrated strategy for the Sahel. Throughout \nthe Sahel, the influence of civil society on national \nand international decision-making warrants attention \nin order to deepen and consolidate the ongoing \nstabilization and peace efforts.\n\nTogether with the United Nations, the African \nUnion and African and international partners, Denmark \nis committed to supporting the efforts in Mali and the \nSahel to facilitate reconciliation through inclusive \ndialogue and the active engagement of civil society. \nWe also support the United Nations Multidimensional \nIntegrated Stabilization Mission in Mali as a strong \nUnited Nations peacekeeping Mission.\n\nSomalia\u2019s New Deal Compact will be crucial for \nreconciliation and peacebuilding and will set the \npriorities for the next three years. It is important that \npeace and development be dealt with in an integrated \nway, and that there be mutual commitment to develop \nand follow up on the Compact for Somalia. We welcome \nthe explicit use in the Compact of the peacebuilding \nand State-building goals from the New Deal Compact, \nand the strong ownership by Somalia to implement the \nprinciples of the New Deal.\n\nThe unregulated and irresponsible international \ntrade in arms has had devastating effects. Earlier this \nyear, the General Assembly made history by adopting \nthe Arms Trade Treaty. Denmark supports the swift \nentry into force and effective implementation of the \nTreaty. Denmark is committed to assisting States, on \ntheir request, to meet their obligations under the Treaty.\n\nWe once again call upon Iran and the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea to comply with international \nlaw and the relevant Security Council resolutions. We \nwelcome all efforts to resolve the issue of Iran\u2019s nuclear \nprogramme.\n\nThe United Nations is more relevant than ever at \na time when strong multilateral cooperation is needed \nto cope with global challenges that transcend national \nborders. No country can confront those challenges \non its own. Seen from the perspective of Denmark as \na small State, the United Nations could and should \ninspire change and help States take action when moving \nforward towards 2015 and beyond.\n"

Guinea has thus \njoined the melting pot of democratic nations that respect \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. It was able \nto do so thanks to the assistance of its partners whose \naction catalysed a fruitful dialogue among the actors \nof Guinean political life. The elections have certainly \nopened the path to widespread development blazed by \nthe Government so that the Guinean population can \nfinally take advantage of its rich potential.\n\nI could not find a better opportunity than from \nthis rostrum to convey the gratitude of the people and \nGovernment of Guinea to the international community \nand to reiterate my country\u2019s commitment to the \nprinciples and purposes of our Organization, . I should \nalso like to pay a well-deserved tribute to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, whose devotion and, above all, \ncompetence have strengthened the central role of the \nUnited Nations in managing crises and improving the \nliving conditions of our populations.\n\nI am firmly convinced that the new President of the \nGeneral Assembly, Mr. John William Ashe, a man of \nthe South, will understand better than anyone what is at \nstake in the theme for this session. I assure him of the \nfull cooperation of my delegation in carrying out his \nnoble mission. We also express our great appreciation \nto his predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremi., for his efforts in \nmaintaining the Assembly at its highest level.\n\nWorld peace and security are at the heart of our \nconcerns and should be the subject of our full attention. \nA number of conflicts have been ended. Countries such \nas Sierra Leone, Liberia, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Burundi have \nbeen able to turn the page of war in order to dedicate \nthemselves to peacebuilding, thereby guaranteeing \nnational reconstruction and sustainable development. \nThe international community has the duty to support \nand assist them.\n\nIn this context, I should like to evoke the case of \nMali, which is emerging from a period of crisis. Sadly, \nthe recent past of that brotherly country reminds us \nof the vulnerability of our States to terrorism and \nextremism, as well as the fragility of our institutions. \nThe international community mobilized unanimously \nto maintain Mali\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity \nand to restore the authority of its State and constitutional \nlegality.\n\nThe peace that reigned in the presidential election \nin Mali certainly augurs a new era of prosperity for \nthe country. Mali urgently needs assistance in order \nto build peace, reconcile the Malians and rebuild their \ncountry. It needs assistance to strengthen its security, \nwhich is indivisible from the Sahelo-Saharan region. \nWe must always recall that terrorism never sleeps; we \nmust combat and defeat it. International security is at \nstake.\n\nGuinea will never abandon its solidarity with Mali. \nIts presence within the United Nations Multidimensional \nIntegrated Stabilization Mission in Mali testifies to our \n\n\n\f\ncommitment to the stabilization of the subregion. The \nGuinean Government reiterates its determination to \nwork for the re-establishment of constitutional order \nin Guinea-Bissau on the basis of the recommendations \nof the Economic Community of West African States \n(ECOWAS), the African Union, the International \nContact Group on Guinea-Bissau, the Community of \nPortuguese-speaking Countries, the European Union \nand the United Nations.\n\nThe Mano River Union is an essential link for the \nconsolidation of peace in West Africa and deserves \nour full attention. The international community, and \nin particular the United Nations and ECOWAS, must \nwork to support that organization in its global approach \nto meeting the security and socioeconomic challenges.\n\nWe welcome the determination of the Peacebuilding \nCommission to assist Sierra Leone, Liberia and \nGuinea in their efforts in security and defence sector \nreform, while promoting youth employment and \nthe empowerment of women on the basis of national \nreconciliation.\n\nWith respect to the Great Lakes region, we urge \nthe parties to renounce violence and to firmly commit \nto bringing peace to the region via adherence to the \nFramework Agreement of 24 February. We thank the \nMediator, President Denis Sassou Nguesso, for his \nefforts to re-establish sustainable peace in eastern \nDemocratic Republic of Congo and the Great Lakes \nregion.\n\nAs for the Central African Republic, urgent \nmeasures are needed to prevent a collapse of the State \nand to avert the chronic instability that threatens the \ncountry. We urge the Sudan and South Sudan to pursue \ndialogue in order to solve pending questions, specifically \nthe status of Abyei province, and to relaunch bilateral \ncooperation.\n\nGiven the deteriotation of the situation in Syria, the \ninternational community must strive further to bring an \nend to the relentless violence and massive destruction \nof lives and property. Guinea condemns the use of \nchemical weapons, which violates international norms \nand human dignity. Robust action must be undertaken \nfor the destruction of the chemical arsenal in Syria, in \naccordance with the Russian-American initiative and \nSecurity Council resolution 2118 (2013). At the same \ntime, the legal framework prohibiting the manufacture, \nstockpiling and use of chemical weapons must be \nstrengthened.\n\nI cannot fail to raise the issue of Western Sahara, \nwhere we call on all stakeholders to spare no effort to \narrive at a political solution. Our solidarity with Cuba \nis as strong as ever as we seek to have the embargo \nunjustly imposed on its people lifted.\n\nI should like to weigh in on a subject of major \nconcern that is the focus of the international \ncommunity\u2019s attention \u2014 the Palestinian question. \nIn spite of the many injunctions of the international \ncommunity, the Palestinian people continue to suffer. \nArbitrary violence, settlements and the seizure of goods \ncontinue to be the people\u2019s daily lot. Guinea reiterates \nits unceasing support for the Palestinian cause, in the \nbelief that peace and stability in the Middle East require \nthe implementation of the relevant resolutions of the \nSecurity Council and the road map of the Quartet, which \nforesees the creation of an independent, sovereign and \nviable Palestinian State living side by side and in peace \nwith Israel within safe and internationally recognized \nborders. We express the hope that the negotiations \nunder way will enable the Palestinian people to finally \nenjoy their inalienable rights.\n\nEver since its creation, the United Nations has \nspared no effort to promote peace, security and \ninternational cooperation in order to ensure the \nharmonious development of humankind. In this context, \nthe Millennium Development Goals were a source of \nreal hope for developing countries. The undeniable \nprogress made in many areas \u2014 growth, education, \ngender equality, and maternal and child health \u2014 has \nlargely contributed to pushing back the borders of \npoverty. Nevertheless, many important challenges have \nstill to be met.\n\nAt a time when the international community is \ninvesting in the creation of a post-2015 development \nagenda, we must recognize that the results achieved by \nthe Millennium Development Goals have not lived up to \nour hopes. The eradication of extreme poverty depends \non the strengthening of the human development base and \nthe promotion of a competitive economy that respects \nthe environment, which is an engine of inclusive growth \nand decent work. It also depends on governance that is \nfavourable to sustainable development in the context of \npeace and security.\n\nIn this quest, the focus must be on the monitoring, \ntransparency and management of our natural resources. \nWe must join in international partnership on the basis \nof reaffirmed solidarity and shared responsibility. That \n\n\n\f\nmust be our new vision. In the formulation of the post-\n2015 development agenda, we must take into account the \nsynergies arising from the complementarity between \nthe Millennium Development Goals and the sustainable \ndevelopment goals. We must also particularly stress \nSouth-South and triangular cooperation, and promote \ninnovative financing in order to bridge the gap in \nofficial development assistance.\n\nIn the unanimous resolve to fight marginalization, \nmy delegation remains convinced that Africa\u2019s fight \nto master its own destiny will be understood. The \ndetermination of Heads of State on the continent to \nadopt a common African position and to create a \nhigh-level committee charged with forging regional \nand intercontinental alliances around the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda are part of the dynamic to build \na better world without conflict and poverty and their \ncorollaries.\n\nMy country has always believed in the value \nof multilateralism, the only guarantor of peace, \ninternational security and shared development. The \nUnited Nations is still the irreplaceable framework \nfor cooperation and the management of world affairs. \nGuinea, as in the past, will continue to contribute to \nthis lofty fight in order to ensure a better future for \nhumankind. That is why it shares the concerns of the \ninternational community and invites it to begin setting \nthe post-2015 stage.\n\nWe leaders must outline how this new world \npartnership will work. It is time to draw lessons from \nthe past in order to launch a fruitful dialogue in which \nall development actors will participate with mutual \nrespect and collective responsibility in the emergence of \nan international society that is more just, equitable and \nmore unified. There is a need for a new international \narchitecture. The world would do better if all nations, \nlarge and small, strong and weak, effectively played \ntheir part towards achieving the overall well-being of \nhumankind.\n\nThe Republic of Guinea will not cease its call \nfor the United Nations system to be reformed and \nadapted to the needs of the moment. It is a question \nof equity and justice. Our will is unshakeable and the \nmomentum is irreversible because the aspirations of \npeople who are passionate about peace, freedom and \nprogress are profound. It is high time to listen to the \nvoices of those who do not have a voice \u2014 the poorest \nand most vulnerable. No one should suffer from hunger, \nfear, illness or the spectre of ignorance. Our duty is to \nleave to future generations an environment conducive \nto sustainable development. Together we will save \nhumanity."

It is appropriate, \ntherefore, that we should pause today and look back to \n1973, when our nation was founded and our membership \nin the United Nations began. In addressing the General \nAssembly for the first time on 1 October 1973, our \nthen Prime Minister, Sir Lynden Pindling, spoke of \nour journey from the dehumanizing experiences of \nslavery and colonialism to the liberating achievements \nof freedom, majority rule and independence. He spoke, \ntoo, of the \u201cperpetual interdependence of the big and \nthe small,\u201d and the fervent wish of the Bahamian people \nto be neither \u201cdominated nor coerced.\u201d He also had this \nto say:\n\n\u201cWe have the means to give new hope to \nmankind, to create a stable international order \ndominated by total and absolute political and \neconomic self-determination and human and moral \nvalues which make human beings paramount, not \nthings or abstractions.\u201d (A/PV.2135, para. 28)\nSir Lynden\u2019s call for us to be faithful to the \nresponsibilities of our nationhood and world citizenship \nis as relevant and compelling today as it was when we \nwere welcomed into the family of the United Nations \n40 years ago. As the present Prime Minister of the \nBahamas, I have therefore come here today, on behalf \nof the people of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, to \nrenew our pledge to play our part to help make our planet \nthe place of peace and stability and of collaborative \n\nendeavour and mutual support that it was intended to \nbe, and must be, for the good of all humankind.\n\nBut we need to ensure that such pledges are not just \nso many catchy phrases. We need to not only talk the talk \nbut walk the walk. We in the Bahamas are determined \nto do just that. That is why, to cite one very recent \nexample, my Minister of Social Development, Melanie \nGriffin, on Tuesday of this week here in New York, \nsigned the United Nations Convention on the Rights \nof Persons with Disabilites on behalf of the Bahamas. \nThis is an important step forward that we have taken, \nmarrying our rhetoric to our actions and synching our \ndomestic agenda with our international obligations. We \nintend to ratify the Convention in the shortest possible \ntime, and later this year we will introduce the necessary \nlegislation in our Parliament to protect the rights of the \ndisabled and to give full effect to our obligations under \nthe Convention. The end to discrimination against the \ndisabled in the Commonwealth of the Bahamas is now \nclearly in sight. Indeed, it is now imminent.\n\nI would also submit today that we are all of us \nunder a moral obligation to ensure that the policies \nand aspirational goals that the General Assembly sets \nfor itself, and to which all Member States subscribe, \nare in fact reflected in the way that we govern our \nrespective nations internally and, to no less a degree, \nin the way that we interact with each other as Member \nStates in the international community. For example, we \ncannot, on the one hand, proclaim that we believe in \nfree trade, then implement policies that inevitably bring \nabout the destruction of agriculture as we know it in \nthe Caribbean, and, in response to the resulting moral \noutcry, simply shrug our shoulders and piously lament \nthat the old order changeth.\n\nWe have to become more conscious of the practical \noutcomes of what we do. Too often, in the headlong \nrush for change, we damage the vulnerable and the \nweak. We then make pledges to help but seldom live \nup to those pledges in any sustained way. We simply \ncannot build a credible new world order on the basis of \nsuch practices. They run completely counter to our lofty \npronouncements about the need for interconnectedness \nand mutual support in the pursuit of economic progress \nfor all the nations of the world, be they large or small, \ndeveloped or developing.\n\nWe see the same dynamic at work in the \nongoing economic aggression of many of the more \ndeveloped countries against small, offshore financial \nservice-based economies, especially in the Caribbean \nregion of which the Bahamas is a part. Some have used \ntheir power, either unilaterally or in small groups of \nhigh-powered nations, to impose their will, arguing that \nthere is something fundamentally immoral, something \nintrinsically sinister, about the accumulation of wealth \nin offshore jurisdictions.\n\nWe reject that premise and we criticize in the \nstrongest possible terms the efforts of some to maim and \ncripple, if not destroy, the offshore economies within \nour region. Ironically, the anti-money-laundering, \nanti-terrorism funding and anti-criminal regulatory \nregimes of many of our countries are far more robust and \ndemonstrably far more effective than the corresponding \nregulatory regimes in many of the same countries that \nare leading the fight against us.\n\nWe firmly believe that offshore financial services \ncan be responsibly operated and regulated. We believe \nthat the sector represents true tax competition and, in \nthe great majority of cases, that it affords an honest \nopportunity for families and individuals alike to \nprotect their privacy while accumulating lawfully \nearned capital for themselves and future generations. \nMoreover, the evidence is overwhelming that most of \nthe investment of that offshore wealth takes place in \nand generally benefits the developed world.\n\nUnilateralism and diplomacy by coercion are not \nthe way the world should be dealing with that issue. \nInstead, we need to challenge the United Nations to \ntake the lead in developing and refining multilateral \nglobal mechanisms for the governance of the offshore \nfinancial services sector \u2014 mechanisms that will meet \nthe legitimate demands of the developed world for \nthe protection of their fiscal systems and their need \nfor greater security, while at the same time allowing \noffshore financial-service economies to continue to \ngrow in an orderly and properly regulated way.\n\nLet us not forget that the destruction of those \noffshore financial-service economies will destabilize \nthe countries that depend upon them for their \nlivelihood. To destroy that sector in the Caribbean \nwould effectively cause tens of thousands of newly \nempowered middle-class citizens to slip back into \npoverty or to migrate to the developed world. The \nmiddle class of which I speak constitutes the anchor \nof social stability for the countries of our region. If it \nis taken away, social destabilization will emerge as a \nrisk of the most ominous kind. And should that risk \n\n\n\f\nmaterialize, the developed world may well end up \nfinding that it has solved one problem only by creating \nan infinitely bigger one for itself.\n\nThe need for greater multilateralism is also evident \nin many of the other problems confronting the Bahamas \nand our region. A matter of the highest national priority \nfor us revolves around our ongoing problem with illegal \nmigration to our shores. We in the Bahamas suffer from \nthe illegal migration of tens of thousands of desperate \npeople from our sister Caribbean Community State \nof Haiti \u2014 an exodus undeniably driven by crushing \npoverty.\n\nWe also have a problem with illegal migration from \nother countries in the Caribbean, albeit to a much lesser \nextent. Of special note in that regard are migrants from \nCuba. We believe that the policies rooted in the Cold \nWar that largely account for that migration ought to be \nbrought into alignment with the realities of the modern \nera.\n\nOur archipelagic nation, though comparatively \nsmall in population, covers a vast area. With our \nhundreds of islands, the opportunities for illegal \nmigration are greatly multiplied. At a time when it is \nimperative that we invest in the education and health \nand future of our people, we are forced instead to devote \nan ever-growing share of our resources to the problems \nassociated with illegal migration.\n\nThe Bahamas, like the rest of the world, \nunderstandably places a great deal of emphasis on \nthe human rights of migrants, but we also believe that \nthere must be similar concerns for the ill-effects on \nmigrant-receiving States such as ours. In particular, \nwe are concerned about the increasingly unsustainable \ncosts that are being incurred and the resulting erosion \nin the quality of life for the citizenry of the Bahamas. \nOur country, the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, \nsimply does not have the financial resources and \ninfrastructural capacity, much less the psychological \nstamina, to endure that dilemma indefinitely.\n\nThat should also remind us of the economic \ndisparities within our region and of the need to intensify \nglobal efforts to eliminate poverty and structural \nimbalances that impede economic growth within \ncertain segments and sections of the Caribbean. For \nas long as those disparities persist, illegal immigration \nto the shores of countries that are comparatively more \nprosperous will continue to grow.\n\nAnother problem that is of special concern to us \nis the continuing influx of guns and the increase in \ngun-related criminality, not only in the Bahamas but \nthroughout the region. As a world community, there \nis, I am convinced, a great deal more that we can and \nshould be doing to fight that common menace.\n\nThe Bahamas has this year signed the Arms \nTrade Treaty, and we encourage all States that have \nnot already done so to sign the Treaty as well. And \nwe implore those countries that produce the guns that \nend up taking innocent lives and causing terror in our \ncommunities to become more proactive in controlling \nthe export of guns. We implore them to step up the \npolicing of their own borders against arms traffickers.\n\nWe therefore call for more robust surveillance and \nreconnaissance measures to be instituted. We already \nhave the experience of joint anti-drug operational \nactivities with the United States of America. However, \nmore resources ought to be employed in a region-wide \neffort to fight crime. In particular, we call for a massive \nincrease in joint tactical operations so that more air \nand maritime assets can be consistently deployed \nand the thousands of square miles that constitute the \nterritorial waters of Caribbean States can be more \neffectively patrolled. We in the Bahamas stand ready \nto play our part in those joint efforts, without which \nthe war on arms trafficking, human smuggling and the \ntransshipment of illicit drugs will never produce the \nvictory we all strive for.\n\nIn a recent talk that I gave to a meeting of the \nInternational Monetary Fund that the Bahamas hosted \nfor the region, I made the point that we must all seek \nto mitigate the vulnerabilities of our small States in \nthe CARICOM region. Of particular concern in that \nregard is the fact that we have as yet been unable to \ndisabuse the international financial organizations of \ntheir conviction that gross domestic product per capita \nis by itself an accurate measure of the wealth of a nation \nor of its state of development.\n\nThe result of the continuing adherence to that \ndogma and the policies that have flowed from it is \nthat the international financial assistance needs of \ncountries in our region are being erroneously assessed \nand misunderstood. I therefore again join all of those \ncalling for a revamping of the criteria in that regard \nso that the true financial assistance and development \nneeds of developing countries can be evaluated in a \nfairer and more balanced and pragmatic way.\n\n\n\f\nAnother significant vulnerability for my country \nconcerns the environment and the need to address \ncomprehensively issues of climate change. The Bahamas \nis surrounded by the sea and is low-lying. Indeed, 80 per \ncent of the land mass of the Bahamas is less than five \nfeet above sea level. The implications of climate change \nand associated rises in sea level are therefore obvious \nfor my country and its people. I would submit that the \nworld, particularly the developed world, has a stake in \nresolving those issues, for while countries such as ours \nmay be the victims of climate change, we are not among \nthe countries that are, in fact, largely responsible for \nthe climate change that threatens our future and that of \nthe planet.\n\nIn the Bahamas, we are waging our own battles. We \nare putting our fiscal house in order. We are introducing \ninnovative tools to fight crime. We are training a new \ngeneration for twenty-first century jobs. We are creating \nnew partnerships to tackle our most pressing problems. \nWe are aggressively pursuing renewable energy. We \nare revamping and modernizing our structure of \ngovernance to make it more responsive to the needs of \nthe twenty-first century. And by the increased use of \nthe referendum machinery, we are demonstrating our \ncommitment to a deepening of our democracy. \n\nWe are a small country with strong convictions and \nbig ideas. But as we look beyond the borders of our \nnation and of the region to gaze upon the global scene, \nwe see much eloquence and many handshakes and the \nceremonial signing of one treaty after another. Rarely, \nhowever, do we see concrete steps or enforcement \nmechanisms with teeth. Ringing declarations have been \nmade from Rio to Copenhagen and beyond, and we are \nconstantly being challenged by our own citizens to \ndemonstrate to them that real and measurable progress \nis being achieved at the global level.\n\nWe need to see more courage, more leadership, more \nsustained action on the global stage. So as the leader \nof a small but proud nation, I take the opportunity to \nsay to the big and powerful nations: Find your courage \nbecause the hour grows late.\n"

        "file_text": "International relations are becoming increasingly \ncomplex and multidimensional, while developments \nin the world are even more rapid and less predictable. \nUnder these circumstances as never before, there is an \nurgent need to agree upon collective responses to the \nkey issues of today. It is solely within the power of such \na truly universal Organization as the United Nations \nto do so. Moreover, such solidarity-based efforts will \nbe productive only if they reflect the entire spectrum \nof views of the international community on global \nchallenges and threats, a broad range of historical \nexperiences and the full cultural and civilizational \ndiversity of the modern world.\n\nFor most of the Members of the United Nations \nfamily, that approach is axiomatic. However, there is \nalso another tendency whereby collective actions are \nunderstood primarily as agreement with the viewpoint \nof one group of countries. Such views manifest \nthemselves in various areas: international security, the \nsettlement of conflict situations, the functioning of the \nworld economy, and the choice of development models \nand core values.\n\nMany problems affecting today\u2019s world are reflected \nin the tragic situation in Syria and in the uncertainty \nsurrounding the development of events in the Middle \nEast and North Africa overall. From the very onset of \nthe turmoil in that region, Russia has consistently called \nfor the development by the international community \nof a common approach combining support for the \nArab peoples on their path to transformation with \nan understanding of the fact that, objectively, those \nprocesses will be lengthy and sometimes painful, and \nthat it will be quite important not to undermine them \nthrough gross outside interference.\n\nWe have emphasized the need to act in a balanced \nway and to take account of the fact that current complex \ndevelopments are associated with, among other things, \na tireless quest for compromises among the various \nethnic and religious groups that make up the mosaic \nof Arab societies. We have consistently supported the \nchoice of the evolutionary way of development and the \npeaceful settlement of crises through national dialogue \nand reconciliation.\n\nAnother perspective has been reflected in the \nattempts made to determine who is and is not legitimate \namong the leaders of the Middle East and North Africa \nregion, to impose a view as to which side should be \nsupported in domestic national conflicts, and to dictate \nexternal, ready-made prescriptions for democratic \ntransformation.\n\nAttempts to portray, in a simplified way, the \ndevelopments in the Arab world as the struggle of \ndemocracy against tyranny or of good against evil \nhave long obscured the problems associated with the \nrising wave of extremism, which is spilling over into \nother regions today. The terrorist attacks in Kenya \nhave demonstrated the full gravity of that threat. It is \ncommon knowledge that jihadist groups that include \nnumerous radical elements from all parts of the world \nare the most combat-capable units of the opposition. \nThe goals that they are pursuing have nothing to do with \ndemocracy but are based on intolerance and aimed at \nthe destruction of secular States and the establishment \nof caliphates. It is difficult to qualify as far-sighted a \npolicy that entails fighting in Mali the same extremist \ngroups that are being supported in Syria.\n\nThe use of chemical weapons is inadmissible. That \ndoes not mean, however, that one can usurp the right \nto accuse and to render verdicts. All of the incidents \nassociated with the use of chemical weapons in Syria, \nby whomsoever committed, must be investigated in a \nprofessional and unbiased manner and then considered \nby the Security Council exclusively on the basis of \nfacts rather than of allegations or assumptions. In that \nrespect, at the Group of 20 (G-20) summit held in June, \nan agreement was reached by leaders of the eight key \nStates.\n\n\n\f\nRecently a common argument has been \nincreasingly made to the effect that the threat or use \nof force, directly prohibited by the Charter of the \nUnited Nations, is virtually the most effective method \nof addressing international problems, including the \nsettlement of domestic conflicts. There have been \nattempts to extrapolate such an approach to the \nsituation in Syria as well, despite the fact that recent \nexperience with such interventions has proved that they \nare ineffective, meaningless and destructive. That is an \nextremely dangerous path leading to the erosion of the \nfoundations of today\u2019s world order and the subversion \nof the weapons of mass destruction non-proliferation \nregimes.\n\nIt is alarming to hear statements about the right \nto use military force to ensure one\u2019s own interests in \nthe Middle East region under the pretext of a persistent \nleadership gap in the international arena. Recent history \nshows that no State, no matter how big or powerful, \ncan cope alone with challenges of the scope faced by \nhumankind today.\n\nThere is no doubt that leadership is required. \nHowever, today it can only be collective leadership \nbased on agreed actions of the leading members of \nthe international community, with strict respect for \nthe principles and norms of international law. It is \nthe growing understanding of that reality that has \nopened the way towards achieving Russia-United \nStates understandings relating to the placing under \ninternational control and subsequent elimination of the \nSyrian chemical arsenals. That became possible thanks \nto the decision by Damascus to join the Chemical \nWeapons Convention and fulfil the relevant obligations \nfollowing the expedited procedure.\n\nWe expect that the decisions of the Organization \nfor the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Executive \nCouncil and the Security Council will contribute to \ncreating the framework required for the elimination of \nchemical arsenals in Syria.\n\nProgress in the area of chemical disarmament in \nSyria should give impetus to the implementation of \nexisting arrangements to convene a conference on \nestablishing a zone free of weapons of mass destruction \nand their means of delivery in the Middle East. We know \nthat there are a number of complicated issues related to \nensuring full participation of the countries of the region \nin such a conference, but they cannot be discussed \nendlessly. That is exactly when true leadership and \nresolve must be demonstrated for the common benefit.\n\nPeople are continuing to die and innocent civilians \nto suffer every day in Syria. Religious minorities, \nincluding Christian communities, are becoming \nvictims of the conflict, which is increasingly acquiring \na sectarian character. Virtually the only possibility \nremaining today to put an end to this turmoil is \nto break the deadlock regarding the process of a \npolitical settlement of the Syrian crisis. We continue \nto work tirelessly for the earliest convening of a peace \nconference to implement the Geneva communiqu\u00e9 \nof 30 July 2012 (S/2012/522, annex). We hope that, \nfollowing the example set by the Government of Syria, \nthe opposition will also constructively respond to the \nRussia-United States initiative.\n\nThe Syrian crisis should not overshadow the need to \naddress the Palestinian problem. We expect the Israeli \nand Palestinian leaders to shoulder their responsibility \nfor the future of their people at this current critical \nstage, where the parties have resumed direct talks \nafter a lengthy interruption. While duly recognizing \nthe efforts made by the United States in the Middle \nEast settlement process, we deem it necessary to \nintensify the activity of the Quartet, the internationally \nrecognized mechanism for providing assistance to the \npeace process in the region on the basis of the relevant \ndecisions of the United Nations, the Madrid principles \nand the Arab Peace Initiative. It is also important to \nensure the close involvement of the Arab countries in \nthe activities of the Quartet.\n\nApproaches based on negotiation are also required \nwith respect to other situations, including the Iranian \nnuclear programme and the nuclear problem in the \nKorean peninsula. As President Vladimir Putin noted \nin his recent article in the 11 September 2013 issue of \nThe New York Times,\n\n\u201cWe must stop using the language of force and \nreturn to the path of civilized diplomatic and \npolitical settlement.\u201d\nThis would help to improve the international \nenvironment and contribute to stepping up collective \nefforts to counter global challenges, including terrorism \nand drug trafficking. Russia intends to attach priority \nattention to these challenges during its presidency of \nthe Group of Eight, in 2014.\n\nToday, when the rigid frame of the bipolar system \nhas been long relegated to the past, a mark of the time \nis the strengthening of the democratic foundations both \nwithin States and in international relations. That means \n\n\n\f\nin particular that the recognition of the right of peoples \nto independently determine their destiny and to choose \nthe optimal forms of social and political structure \nand social and economic systems should become an \nindisputable norm of conduct. In the same way, the \ncomplex of exclusiveness and supremacy regarding \none\u2019s own customs in the human rights area should be \nabandoned and instead the universal criteria enshrined \nin the Universal Declaration of Human Rights should \nbe used as a guideline. Moreover, it is important to \nrespect the traditional values that are common to all \nthe religions.\n\nIt is obvious that a genuine partnership is hardly \nachievable without reliance on the foundations of \neconomic cooperation. The prevailing majority of \nStates are interacting within the framework of the \nWorld Trade Organization and in that sense they are \nalready operating in a common economic space. \nThis creates the prerequisites for working towards \nharmonization of integration processes in various \nregions of the world instead of trying to artificially pit \nthem against each other by creating new division lines. \nRussia is proceeding from that exact understanding in \nits joint work with its partners in the establishment of \nthe Eurasian Economic Union.\n\nRussia attaches great importance to achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals and the drafting of the \nglobal development agenda for the post-2015 period \non their basis. The main priorities are the eradication \nof poverty and support for economic growth through \nthe expansion of investment opportunities and the \ncreation of new jobs. Some of the most urgent issues \nare the strengthening of the energy and transport \ninfrastructures, the fight against infectious diseases \nand road safety.\n\nCooperation among States should rely on efficient \nmechanisms and an adequate resource base. In that \ncontext, we support the further strengthening of the \ncoordinating role and potential of the United Nations \nEconomic and Social Council. During its chairmanship \nof the Group of 20, Russia has consistently pursued \na policy of developing its interaction with the United \nNations. We believe that the General Assembly, in \ncooperation with the G-20, will develop a realistic \nprogramme of long-term cooperation.\n\nI firmly believe that, by joining forces on the basis \nof genuine respect and considering the interests of each \nand everyone, we will be able to achieve the lofty goals \nthat are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Let me begin by \ncongratulating His Excellency Ambassador John \nAshe on his election to the presidency of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. May I also take \nthis opportunity to commend His Excellency Mr. Vuk \nJeremi. for his skilful stewardship of the sixty-seventh \nsession. Our profound appreciation of course also goes \nto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his inspirational \nleadership of the Organization.\n\nThe theme of this session \u2014 \u201cThe post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage\u201d \u2014 is timely \nand well-chosen, for we are now making the final push \n\n\n\f\ntowards the fulfilment of the Millennium Development \nGoals by the 2015 deadline. Simultaneously, work has \nbegun on framing the post-2015 global development \nagenda to end extreme poverty and ensure sustainable \ngrowth with equity. That agenda must be anchored \nby a new global partnership \u2014 a vision reflected \nin President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono\u2019s role as \none of the three co-Chairs of the High-level Panel \nof Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development \nAgenda and recognition of the fact that the success of \nthe forthcoming intergovernmental process requires \nthe capacity to forge a global consensus to identify and \nbuild upon common interests. \n\nIndonesia has an enduring belief in the efficacy \nand effectiveness of diplomacy, maintaining peace \nand security, advancing social progress and economic \nprosperity and promoting democracy, human rights and \ntolerance.\n\nThe conflict in Syria has long demanded such \na political and diplomatic solution, for amid the \nundoubted complexity of the situation three key \npoints are compelling, namely, halting the violence, \nfacilitating humanitarian relief and beginning an \ninclusive political process that reflects the wishes of \nthe Syrian people. The recent breakthrough on the \nissue of chemical weapons in Syria is clear evidence \nthat diplomacy works. Further diplomatic momentum \nmust be generated. The Security Council must be one to \nforcefully make the case for a peaceful settlement. To \nget the parties to the negotiating table, the \u201cGeneva II\u201d \nconference must be convened at the earliest opportunity.\n\nOn the issue of Palestine, the full weight of \ndiplomatic pressure must similarly be brought to \nbear and resolutions of the General Assembly and the \nSecurity Council implemented. The historic injustice \nthat the Palestinian people have suffered for so long \nmust be ended. We are encouraged by and welcome, \ntherefore, the resumption of direct negotiations between \nPalestine and Israel, the result, no less, of painstaking \nand relentless diplomatic efforts. The revival of the \nlong-stalled nuclear disarmament agenda is also \nkey. In particular, as co-President of the Article XIV \nConference on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \nTreaty, Indonesia calls for the early entry into force of \nthe Treaty.\n\nThe same relentless diplomatic pursuit must be \napplied to what is manifestly in the common interests \nof all, that is, the eradication of poverty, the promotion \nof sustainable development and inclusive financing and \novercoming the challenges of climate change. We have \nin ourselves the wherewithal to address the development \nchallenges of our time \u2014 for example, to work for an \nearly conclusion of the Doha development agenda and a \nnew climate-change regime by 2015.\n\nKey to that, however, must be a strong commitment \nto the spirit of partnership and an unshakeable belief \nin the power of multilateralism: cooperation and \ncollaboration rather than discord and division. The \ndevelopment agenda must work for all countries, large \nor small, developed and developing. Each of us must \nshare responsibility. Developed countries must take the \nlead, while developing countries must do more.\n\nThe pursuit of a diplomatic path becomes fraught \nwith challenges in a complex and fast-changing world \nwhere the issues of governance, human rights violations, \nextremism and intolerance within countries can \nquickly gain inter-State dimensions. We must ensure \nthat the institutions of the United Nations are ready to \naddress such contemporary challenges. Therefore, as \ncountries embark upon a process of democratization \nand the promotion and protection of human rights, as \nthey draw a line against intolerance and extremism, \nthe international community, the United Nations, \nmust contribute towards ensuring an atmosphere that \nis conducive to their peaceful transformation, one that \nreflects the wishes of the peoples concerned.\n\nTogether with its partners in the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Indonesia is \nsteadily developing a regional architecture conducive \nto the peaceful promotion of human rights and \ndemocracy. It is called the ASEAN Political-Security \nCommunity. Together with the economic community \nand sociocultural community pillars, it makes up the \nASEAN Community that we are to achieve by 2015. \nThrough a process of sharing lessons learned derived \nfrom our respective successes and setbacks, we provide \nmutual encouragement and support in our promotion \nof the principles of democracy, the rule of law and \ngood governance, and respect for and the promotion of \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms as inscribed \nin the ASEAN Charter.\n\nBeyond South-East Asia, Indonesia is pursuing \nthe same positive and constructive approach through \nwhat is called the Bali Democracy Forum, a platform \nfor countries in the wider region to shareone anothers\u2019 \nexperiences. At all levels \u2014 national, regional and \n\n\n\f\nglobal \u2014 we remain steadfast in promoting tolerance \nand religious freedom, pushing back against prejudice \nand intolerance and building partnerships, harmony \nand mutual respect. Indonesia recognizes, therefore, the \nspecial responsibility incumbent upon it as host of the \nUnited Nations Alliance of Civilizations Global Forum \nin 2014, one that aims to promote unity in diversity.\n\nThe primacy of diplomacy and of the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes over war and conflict is not \nmore evident than in the quiet and yet fundamental \ntransformations that have been taking place in \nour region, South-East Asia. Notwithstanding the \ncontinuing challenges, Indonesia believes that the \ndividends of peace and stability are self-evident: \neconomic and social progress.\n\nThe continued stability and security of the region \nis therefore the key to securing our prosperity. Peace \nand development are indivisible. With other ASEAN \nnations, Indonesia has worked constantly to develop \nthe region\u2019s capacity to manage and overcome any \npotential for conflict and to ensure that it remains a \nnet contributor to international peace and security; to \nextend the arc of stability beyond South-East Asia to the \nAsia-Pacific region at large while promoting common \nsecurity, common prosperity and common stability \nfor all in the region; and, through commitments to the \npeaceful settlement of disputes and the renunciation \nof the use or threat of force, to ensure that the region \nplaces diplomacy at the forefront.\n\nIndonesia will be tireless in promoting the primacy \nof diplomacy, and unwavering in its belief in the noble \ngoals of the United Nations.\n"

I \nconvey also my special greetings to those attending this \nannual general debate of the General Assembly.\n\nWe are here once again, as usual, to share \nexperiences relating to leadership and to work for the \nsake of life, humanity, equality and social justice. But \nwe are also here to express our profound differences as \nconcerns life, peace and democracy. Over the past few \ndays I have been listening to the statements made by \ncertain Powers, which leave a lot to be desired in terms \nof liberty, equality, dignity and sovereignty.\n\nThanks to the awareness of the Bolivian people, I \nhave now held the presidency for almost eight years. In \nthat time \u2014 despite the economic and financial crises in \nsome so-called developed, industrialized and, I would \neven say, even exaggeratedly industrialized countries, \nbecause some Powers industrialize simply to put an end \nto life \u2014 we in Bolivia have an economic growth rate of \n4.8 per cent, on average. Previously it was just over 2 per \ncent under the economic policies of the free market and \nneoliberalism. This year the economic growth rate is \nestimated at 6 per cent, at least, so we are doing well. \n\nI would like to point out that thanks to that economic \ngrowth, in the context of the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) we have reduced poverty; we have met \nthe MDG of reducing poverty and extreme poverty. \nUnited Nations data for 2011 indicates that that year \n1 million Bolivian men and women entered the middle \nclass. Bolivia has 10 million inhabitants, so that means \nthat 10 per cent of Bolivia\u2019s inhabitants improved \ntheir economic status. The rate of undernutrition for \nchildren under the age of 5 has decreased even more \nthan required by the related Millennium Development \nGoal. The literacy-rate goal for people between 15 and \n24 years of age was met, and UNESCO declared Bolivia \na country free of illiteracy thanks to the cooperation of \nCuba and Venezuela, which have been working with us \nsince 2006-2007.\n\nThe Goal on coverage in terms of maternal health \nhas been reached, and maternal and child mortality has \ndecreased. Thanks to that economic growth we have \nbeen able to create vouchers for pregnant women and \nfor children under 2 years of age, which has made \npossible a decrease in maternal and child mortality. \nCoverage in terms of potable water has increased. For \nexample, we created a programme entitled \u201cMy water \n(more investment for water)\u201d. I must thank the Andean \nDevelopment Corporation and the Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank for their contributions. With their \nfunding we put together \u201cMy water\u201d I and II, and we \nare now on the third programme, with $300,000 per \nmunicipality in rural areas. That has made it possible \nfor us to provide some municipalities with 100 per cent \ncoverage in terms of potable water.\n\nI have just come from a major event in the department \nof Santa Cruz, where I visited several municipalities. \nIn two of them, the mayors \u2014 who are not from the \nparty in power but from other parties \u2014 told me that \n\u201cMy water\u201d III will result in 100 per cent of the local \npopulation having drinking water. We have made \nadvances in that area. Investment in water is a blessing \nfor life. It means minimizing disease, because potable \nwater helps people avoid contracting diseases. \n\nI would like all here to know that we have been able \nto achieve this thanks to a State that lives in conditions \nof sovereignty and dignity. Why am I saying this? \nBecause previously, politically we were subject to the \nAmerican empire. The embassies of the United States \ndecided who would be minister. Economically, we were \nsubject to the International Monetary Fund. From the \ntime we arrived, we have said \u201cEnough!\u201d to submitting \nto international organizations and to the United States \nembassy. Previously, for any loan, the International \nMonetary Fund set conditionalities, blackmailing the \nvarious Governments. Those conditionalities involved \nour giving up our natural resources to transnational \ncompanies, so that Bolivia would privatize basic \nservices. But basic services are a human right and \ncannot be private property. So when we freed ourselves \npolitically and economically, we started to do better.\n\nOne of the policies we adopted was to nationalize \nhydrocarbons \u2014 gas and oil. I want the Assembly to \nknow, just to share a small experience, that previously \nState contracts with transnational oil companies stated \nthat the bearer acquired the right to the land at the mouth \nof the well. When union leaders asked Governments \nwhy the gas and oil were not the property of Bolivians, \nthey told us that as long as they were underground they \nbelonged to the Bolivians, but once they were out of the \nground that was no longer the case. They invented this \ntitle business for the land at the mouth of the well. \n\n\n\f\nIn addition, 82 per cent of the benefits went to \ntransnationals, especially in mega-oilfields, and 18 per \ncent to Bolivians. It was looting, it was theft. But since \nwe nationalized hydrocarbons, I must say that we \nhave really begun to improve the economic situation \nand the social conditions in our country. Just one \nexample: oil income in 2005, before I was President, \nwas $300 million. This year, thanks to nationalization \nand the fight waged by social movements, oil sales will \ntotal more than $5 billion. Last year we almost reached \n$5 billion. That figure continues to grow with new \ninvestments, and today we have reached the stage of \ngiving added value to those natural resources.\n\nAs the Assembly is aware, I am not an expert in \npolitics or in economic matters. But I am here at the \nrequest of the Bolivian people, learning daily about the \nneeds, problems and demands of my people, the people \nof Bolivia.\n\nI would therefore also like to say that this joint work \nwith the social movements, which are the organized \nrepresentatives of the people, is going well. I would \nlike the United Nations and the Secretary-General to \nknow that we have issued a directive and are working \non the patriotic agenda for 2025. What exactly is that \nagenda about? As Bolivia was founded in 1825, the year \n2025 will be our bicentennial as a republic, while we \nare now a plurinational State. We are working with all \nsocial movements and authorities, be they local mayors \nor provincial Governments, to establish a medium- and \nlong-term plan that will make it possible to guarantee a \nfuture for the generations to come.\n\nBesides local issues, there are also pending regional \nissues, such as the one between Bolivia and Chile on \nsovereign access to the Pacific Ocean. An invasion \nbegan on 14 February 1879, which on 23 March of \nthe same year gave rise to a limited resistance. Who \ninvaded us? It was the Chilean oligarchy of the time, \nalong with British companies. We lost our access to the \nsea, and many meetings have been subsequently held \non the issue. An unfair treaty was imposed on us, and it \nwas not observed. \n\nI want the Assembly to be aware of the following. \nIn a number of meetings with former Presidents and \nwith the latest brotherly President of Chile, we have \ntried to reach an understanding. However, there has \nnever been an official proposal to resolve the issue of \nthe Bolivian people\u2019s irrevocable right to return to the \nPacific with sovereignty. \n\nWhat did the President of Chile say in September \n2010 when he addressed the General Assembly here \nin New York (see A/65/PV.12)? He said that treaties \nwere inviolable and they must not be touched. On \n28 January 2013, during the summit of the Community \nof Latin America and the Caribbean States (CELAC) \nin Santiago, President Pi\u00f1era Eche\u00f1ique said that of \ncourse treaties could be perfected. First, he said they \nwere untouchable, and then he said they could be \nperfected. That shows that this issue is on his mind and \nthat it needs to be resolved. \n\nOn 17 December 2012, Pi\u00f1era Eche\u00f1ique publicly \nstated that Chile would ensure respect not only for the \ntreaties it had signed, but also its sovereignty, with \nall the strength in the world. But in January at the \nCELAC summit President Pi\u00f1era Eche\u00f1ique said that \nsovereignty could not be touched unless economic \ninterests were at stake. On 22 September 2011, at the \nGeneral Assembly President Pi\u00f1era Eche\u00f1ique said \nthat there were no ongoing territorial issues between \nChile and Bolivia (see A/66/PV.15). However, on \n2 February 2013, in an interview with La Tercera, a \nChilean newspaper, he recognized the following: Chile \nhas offered Bolivia autonomy in a territorial enclave. In \nother words, he is trying to resolve the issue. But that \nproposal has never been made official. \n\nThere is a fourth contradiction. On 11 November \n2012, at the Ibero-American Summit held in Cadiz, \nSpain, the President of Chile said that Chile would \ndemand that a valid treaty that was still in force \u2014 the \ntreaty of 1904 \u2014 be respected, and that any conversation \nabout the matter must be bilateral in nature: it did not \nbelong in a multilateral forum such as that in which we \nare participating today. \n\nWhat did the President of Chile say on 2 February \n2013? He said that the possibility of a gateway to the \nsea without sovereignty, north of Arica, will come to an \nend if Peru won at The Hague. Another contradiction: \nin June 2013, President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era Eche\u00f1ique \nsaid that Chile had the right to defend its territory, \nsea and sovereignty with strength and conviction and \nthat Chile was a country that would never bend in the \nlegitimate defence of its territory. In June, he said \nthat Chile would not cede to the Bolivian position \nwhile President Morales continued to belittle him. On \n7 September 2013, he said that, naturally, they would \nrespect the ruling from The Hague. When it came to \nthe ruling from The Hague, they were a country that \nrespected rulings. \n\n\n\f\nI simply wanted to state that to avoid conflict. \nSince its foundation as a plurinational State, Bolivia has \nbeen by nature a peaceful State. With all due respect, \nI would like to inform members that we have turned to \ninternational courts. We have requested the International \nCourt of Justice to declare that the Republic of Chile \nhas an obligation to effectively negotiate, in a timely \nfashion and in good faith, sovereign access to the Pacific \nOcean in order to re-establish Bolivia\u2019s past, present \nand future rights to the sea. I want members to be aware \nthat this request cannot and should not be interpreted as \nan act of hostility. On the contrary, it is a demonstration \nof Bolivia\u2019s respect and confidence in the mechanisms \nfor the peaceful settlement of international disputes. \n\nMembers cannot imagine how much damage we \nhave suffered, economically and geographically, or the \ndamage that has been done to the people of Bolivia and \nto our past and future generations, by the 1879 invasion. \nOur grandparents continue to ask us when we are going \nto go back to the sea, because Bolivia was born with an \noutlet to the Pacific Ocean. So that everyone is aware: \nwe are seeking a peaceful solution to this dispute. \n\nWe have heard the various statements made over \nthe past few days. One cannot listen to every single one \nof them, but I want to say that, while we are working \nto eliminate extreme poverty, we, the Heads of State \nand Government, are also working for peace with social \njustice. Nevertheless, a handful of Powers promote \nwars, armed conflict and military intervention without \nrespecting even international organizations. \n\nWe have heard here statements about freedom, \ndemocracy, peace, justice and security. As peoples \nwho have been the subject of interventions and have \nbeen exploited, marginalized and robbed of our natural \nresources by the empires of the time, we wonder what \ndemocracy, what peace and what social justice some \nPresidents who come here are talking about. We witness \nPresidents and their retinues blocking airspace and not \nproviding guarantees of our attendance to this forum, \nfor example. How can they speak of democracy, when \nthe spy services of the United States violate human \nrights and the privacy and security of other States while \nusing private companies? It turns out that they spy not \nonly on democratic Governments, but even on their own \nallies, their own citizens and the United Nations itself. \nWell, fine, let them spy on us anti-imperialist Presidents \nand Governments. But spying on the United Nations? \nSpying on their allies? I feel that there is a great deal of \noverweening arrogance towards humankind.\n\nThat is why we continue to speak out. Not only \ndo they spy, they also hatch coups d\u2019\u00e9tat. What peace \ncan we speak of when military spending sacrifices the \nhuman rights of our peoples? I would like to ask the \npeople of the United States: How is it possible, when \nthere are so many people out of work, for their country\u2019s \nGovernment and President to spend $700 billion on \nthe military and espionage annually, when there are \nso many of our brothers in the United States who are \nhomeless and jobless and without an education? One \ncannot understand how that country can spend so much \nmoney interfering with other countries while leaving \nits own unprovided for.\n\nThey talk to us of human rights while torture is \nbeing carried out in the prisons of Guant\u00e1namo and \non military bases in the Middle East, and while union \nand political leaders who do not share imperialist \nand capitalist views are also tortured. I would like to \nsay to the United States that it must not believe it is \nmaster of the world. It is mistaken. Furthermore, it \nsigns agreements yet refuses to sign some of the most \nimportant treaties in the world. It does not respect \nUnited Nations resolutions.\n\nThe security of the empire and the fight against \nterrorism have become the biggest excuse and tool \nfor unilateral military intervention. Terrorism cannot \nbe combated through more military spending and \ninterventions or the training of military forces. As \nfar as I know, the way to fight terrorism is with social \npolicies, not military bases; with religious tolerance, \nmore democracy, more equality of justice and more \neducation. \n\nWhat country is free from problems? Of course \nthere are differences. The best thing to do is to provide \nmeans, even if not all our Governments have the same \neconomic policies. Capitalism wants to emerge from its \ncrisis through war and armed intervention. We must ask \nourselves who benefits from the wars. Who distributes \nthe natural resources after an intervention? Whose \nhands do they end up in, once countries are bombed? \nWho is really governing in the United States, I wonder? \nIs it its citizens, or the companies that promote wars? \nFrom outside, at least \u2014 I am not an ambassador living \nin the United States \u2014 what we see is that those who \nfinance political and election campaigns are bankers \nand big businessmen, and they are the ones setting \npolicy.\n\nThose who govern cannot be mistaken or confused \nabout the conflict in Syria. Naturally, we are against \n\n\n\f\nthe use of chemical weapons and weapons of mass \ndestruction. But who possesses the greatest nuclear \narsenal? Who invented chemical weapons? Who \nindustrialized those weapons that end human lives? In \nmy region, at least, things are perfectly clear. We know \nwhose hands they are in, where they come from and \nwho produces them. \n\nDemocracies do not wage war. What we are seeing \nis that those who make the decisions about wars are the \narms industry, the financial system and oil companies. \nPlutocracy has become a substitute for democracy. The \nGovernment of the rich and powerful decides the fate of \nthe world. We are facing a new moment in the imperial \ngeopolitical disposition \u2014 and I do not wish to revisit \nhow Latin America and the Caribbean, like Africa and \nthe Middle East, were at one time carved up by various \nimperial Powers, who were interested not in resolving \nissues of poverty, democracy and equality but rather \nin those countries\u2019 natural resources \u2014 and now, once \nagain, those Powers wish to divide it all up through \nmilitary intervention and with military bases.\n\nAnother subject being debated is the colonization \nof space, as we have seen in recent years. Those who \nbelieve they are the masters of the world have told \nus that their power has no limits and that they can \nintervene wherever they feel like. Again, I wonder what \nthe United Nations is for. What do we have treaties and \nconventions for? What use is multilateralism? Human \nmultilateralism we welcome; inhuman interventionism \nwill be combated by people all over the world. I believe \nthat as a union leader and as someone from one of the \nmost humiliated sectors in the history of Latin America, \nthe indigenous peasant peoples.\n\nWar is a business for capitalism. There can be no \npeace without justice; there can be no equality as long \nas the business of war has pride of place. It starts and \nwages wars for its businesses. That is why I believe it is \nimportant at this event to consider such issues in depth.\n\nAnother instrument of domination is the fight \nagainst drug trafficking. But I have to say that despite \nthe efforts of the Bolivian people and Government, \nthere are certain Powers that do not shoulder their \nresponsibilities in combating the traffic in drugs, \nbecause the drug market is in the capitalist countries. \nSince we got rid of the Drug Enforcement Agency \n(DEA) and launched our own national policy \u2014 and \nthanks to some of our neighbours, such as Argentina, \nBrazil and Chile, to which I am grateful for their joint \nefforts \u2014 we have seen improvements and a better way \nof fighting drug trafficking than the way imposed by \nthe DEA and the United States. I welcome the fact that \nthe United Nations has acknowledged the decrease in \ndrug trafficking in Bolivia, but it has not been certified \nby the Government of the United States. Who should \nwe believe, the United States or the United Nations? I \nleave it up to the Assembly.\n\nI have felt somewhat insecure when it comes to \nvisiting the United Nations in New York, which is \nwhy we should think seriously about changing the \nlocation of the Headquarters of the Organization. The \nHeadquarters of the United Nations should be in the \nterritory of a State that has ratified all the treaties \nadopted by the United Nations. As the Assembly is \naware, the Government has never ratified the treaties on \nhuman rights or the rights of Mother Earth. They do not \nguarantee us visas or overflights. I offer my solidarity \nwith my friend Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Moros, President of \nVenezuela. How can we be sure that a meeting of the \nUnited Nations here in New York is secure? Perhaps \nsome of us do, but those of us who do not share the \nviews of imperialism and capitalism feel completely \ninsecure. \n\nI would just like to say, though not out of fear, that \nwe should not be complicit in such an arrogant attitude \nto the peoples of the world. How can we genuinely \nbelieve in the United Nations if we do not respect \nresolutions \u2014 for example, those ending the economic \nblockade of Cuba. There are only two or three countries \nthat do not vote to end it. Most of us welcome it and \nvote for the resolution every time. But if it is not \nimplemented and not respected, then why are we here \nat the United Nations?\n\nFurthermore, I wish to inform the Assembly \nthat everyone knows that the United States harbours \nterrorists, criminals and the corrupt. They escape \nfrom Bolivian justice and arrive here. The United \nStates Government is not assisting in the fight against \ncorruption. What kind of an agreement could we then \nhave in the fight against corruption? \n\nBeyond that, the United States accuses the \nGovernments of other countries. It accuses Cuba, of \npromoting terrorism. How can Cuba do that? Perhaps it \nis due to such accusations that only 60 or 70 Presidents, \nof the more than 190, have come here. I feel that such \npolicies scare off Presidents. Who will come next year \nto vote, when resolutions are never respected? \n\n\n\f\nThat reason, and many others, should encourage us \nto consider changing the Headquarters of the United \nNations. I do not expect it to be Bolivia, or South \nAmerica. There are countries that have ratified all of the \nhuman rights treaties. That is where the Headquarters \nof the United Nations should be located.\n\nThere is blackmail when it comes to visas. I had to \nwait for a visa in order to come here, and then it was \nfor only four, five or six days \u2014 no more. What good \nis such a visa? One has to watch the clock and when \nto leave, because the visa will be taken from us. We \nare being threatened, intimidated and blackmailed with \nvisas.\n\nIf the Assembly is here to seriously discuss the well-\nbeing of humankind, perhaps my country can share \nwith some who are present here the idea of seriously \nconsidering establishing a tribunal of the peoples, \nincluding major international organizations that defend \nhuman rights, to begin an investigation of the Obama \nGovernment. \n\nI was surprised by the words of United States \nPresident Obama at the start of his term. It struck me \nwhen he stated, \u201cI was elected to end wars\u201d. Those \nwere his words, found in newspapers, on radio and on \ntelevision. I said to myself, this fraternal President of \nthe United States originates from a family that suffered \nfrom discrimination like me. We are going to agree and \nwe will put an end to war. I was deeply struck by that. \nNow we are seeing the exact opposite. Perhaps it is due \nto the Nobel Peace Prize. We congratulate him. In the \nend, however, it is a Nobel Peace Prize, rather than a \nNobel war prize. \n\nWhat is the basis for a trial? It certainly includes \ncrimes against humanity and the bombing of Libya. \nI would like to know who owned the oil in Libya \nbeforehand? Who owns it now? Previously, at the least, \nthe people of Libya benefited from that oil, but how is it \nbeing managed and used now? What happened in Iraq? \nI am convinced that behind any war or intervention, \na plan is being devised on how to later seize the \nnatural resources. That was our experience in Bolivia. \nHowever, we have recovered our natural resources \ndemocratically, without bullets but with votes, not \nwith money but based on the awareness of the Bolivian \npeople. \n\nAs for prosecuting acts of international terrorism, \nthe financing of terrorist groups and the arming of \nopposition forces \u2014 once I expelled the United States \nAmbassador to Bolivia, I had no regrets. We are better \noff now, politically and democratically. We are now \nending our cooperation with the United States Agency \nfor International Development, which had been plotting. \nWe want and welcome cooperation, so long as it is \nunconditional and free of blackmail or preconditions \ninvolving Presidents or the privatization of natural \nresources and basic services. \n\nImagine the damage inflicted on a country by \nan economic blockade. It is the best tool of genocide. \nTherefore, if we are truly responsible for the well-being \nof humankind, if we are responsible for truth, justice \nand peace, then we must organize to fight back so that \nno president \u2014 from South America, the Middle East \nor anywhere else in the world \u2014 will ever again cause \nharm to life or to humankind. \n\nLike previous debates here \u2014 on the financial, \nclimate, economic and food crises \u2014 the Assembly is \nnow addressing the issue of interventionism. As long \nas imperialism and capitalism exist, peace, justice, \nliberty, dignity and sovereignty for the people of the \nworld will never be possible. I am convinced of that, \nbecause I have a little experience. We should therefore \ncontemplate a world free of oligarchies, monarchies \nand hierarchies, and then consider the sort of human \norder we would want for the world.\n\nAll of us possess sovereignty and dignity, whether \nwe are small and backwards \u2014 \u201cdeveloping\u201d, as they \ncall us \u2014 or whatever our situation. What damages the \npolitical class? Sometimes it is arrogance, the abuse of \npower and corruption. As Presidents of Governments, it \nis our obligation to fight against such policies that cause \nso much harm to the political class. It is our obligation \nto change the politics. In my experience, politics is not \nabout business or profits. It is about service, commitment \nand extending the greatest effort for one\u2019s people. If \nanyone thinks that politics involves business or profit, \nthey are wrong. Such President or Government will not \ngo far. If a Government allows bankers, financiers or \nmultinational corporations to govern, it is mistaken. \nA Government must be controlled by a President who \nhas been democratically elected by the people, with the \nparticipation of society and for the well-being of the \nmajority of the people. \n\nWe welcome the fact that private property is \nrespected. However, it is something else when economic \npolicy and governing are considered in favour of the \nfew, rather than of the many. With my little bit of \nexperience, therefore, I call on all members to fight \n\n\n\f\nagainst the economic policies that cause great harm to \nhumankind around the world. \n\nI reiterate that as long as imperialism and \ncapitalism exist, the struggle will continue, the people \nwill continue to rise up, but there will be no justice. \nFreeing ourselves from imperialism and capitalism will \ncertainly ensure peace and social justice and dignity \nand sovereignty for our peoples.\n"

        "file_text": "We bring to this sixty-eighth session of the \nGeneral Assembly the fraternal and friendly greetings \nof the people of Equatorial Guinea. We also bring our \nfervent desire for peace and prosperity for all countries \nin the world at this difficult time, when the international \ncommunity has to deal with major challenges that are \nthwarting the aspirations of the peoples for well-being \nand happiness.\n\nMay I also extend my congratulations to Mr. John \nWilliam Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda on his election \nto preside over the work of the General Assembly at \nthis session. We wish him all the very best and every \nsuccess in his difficult task, and we assure him of our \nsupport and cooperation. We would also like to thank \nhis predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremi., for the excellent work \nhe carried out and the dynamic style with which he \npresided over the work of the Assembly at its previous \nsession.\n\nThis sixty-eighth session is beginning its work on \na tragic note, namely, the criminal and barbaric attack \nagainst innocent people in Kenya. It was an attack on \na supermarket, a mall, which is a peaceful gathering \nplace for people, which reflects the criminality of the \nperpetrators. Equatorial Guinea strongly condemns \nthe heinous attack against the freedom and dignity \nof the Kenyan people, which also retards its national \n\n\n\f\ndevelopment and violates its freedoms. I convey \nour condolences and a feeling of solidarity to the \nGovernment of Kenya and the families of the victims. \nWe also call on the United Nations to take severe \nmeasures against crimes of that nature.\n\nAlthough the international community has become \nincreasingly conscious of the importance of peace, we \nstill see, unfortunately, that the United Nations has not \nyet achieved its main objectives, namely, a peaceful \nand developed world, one ensuring the dignity and \nwell-being of all peoples in the world. Thus, despite the \nmajor efforts that have been made over the past 68 years, \npeace is still as yet an unrealized dream in many parts \nof the world. The sovereign equality of all States can be \nseen only in declarations of principles. Economic and \nsocial development has not yet been achieved by most \nStates, and the principles of cooperation for mutual \nbenefit are being undermined in international relations.\n\nAt the same time, in addition to that disturbing \nsituation, we see an increase in natural disasters, wars, \nterrorism and acts of violence, which take human lives \nand force large groups of populations from their homes. \nHunger haunts almost three quarters of the world\u2019s \npopulation, and there are still major endemic diseases \nthat cause many deaths in less developed countries: \nthey affect in particular the most vulnerable segments \nof society.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of that difficult political, \neconomic and sociocultural situation around the world, \nEquatorial Guinea would like to acknowledge the \nefforts of the Secretary-General to preserve the noble \nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and to \nseek to achieve the goals set forth therein. However, the \nalmost incomprehensible ideological tenor of relations \namong States creates almost a kind of cold war between \nthose that proclaim themselves moral authorities and a \nmajority that want freedom of action to determine the \nfutures of their peoples.\n\nAs far as the Republic of Equatorial Guinea is \nconcerned, questions of the peace and security of \nStates should be given full priority and consideration \nby the United Nations, since without peace, there can \nbe no development, and without development it would \nbe difficult to ensure human beings\u2019 dignity, integrity \nand freedom. For that reason, we firmly support \nthe principle of the peaceful settlement of conflicts \nthrough negotiation, mediation and arbitration. In \nthat connection, we would like to commend and \nacknowledge the efforts of Mr. Tomislav Nikoli., \nPresident of the Republic of Serbia, for presiding over \nthe special session of the General Assembly held in \nApril of this year on the peaceful resolution of conflicts \nin Africa.\n\nEquatorial Guinea\u2019s political, economic and \nsociocultural situation is positive and encouraging, \nbecause our country enjoys productive peace and \nstability and harmonious political development and is \nconsolidating a genuine national democracy. All of that \nhas allowed us to carry out significant infrastructure \nwork, enabling the people to participate directly in the \ncountry\u2019s overall growth. The Government, together \nwith all the political institutions, is carrying out major \npolitical reforms, thanks to the agreements reached in \nthe binding national political pact, which was signed \nwith all the country\u2019s political groups and which \nestablishes standards for the political conduct of all \nstakeholders and their participation in public affairs \nadministration. Happily, the people of Equatorial \nGuinea are aware of the changes in the areas benefiting \nthem, and they recognize and support them.\n\nAt the international level, we are very concerned \nabout the negative effects of the so-called humanitarian \ninterference from the United Nations, which, far from \nensuring the human rights and well-being of the peoples \naffected, is more focused on imposing political systems \nand democracy based on unacknowledged interests. That \ninterference is being carried out in total disregard of the \nsacred principles of national sovereignty and the dignity \nof peoples. Democracy is indeed the ultimate expression \nof natural law; it is also an act of the people\u2019s sovereign \nwill. We have never seen any country in the world \naccept democracy when it was imposed on it. And why \nhas it now become the excuse for intervening through \nforce in conflicts within self-governing countries? That \nrepresents a provocation against our peoples, who are \nbeing deceived in the name of democracy, while the \nfundamental attributes of independence and national \nsovereignty are disregarded, provoking civil disorder, \nwhich leads to loss of life, social divisiveness and the \ndestruction of basic infrastructure, which is difficult \nto rebuild. We see, therefore, that everything is easily \ntraced to the neocolonialist activities of certain parties \nthat wish to recover the resources that nature reserved \nfor our countries.\n\nEquatorial Guinea understands and agrees that \nsecurity and development are an essential whole, and \nwe affirm that peace and security, development and \nhuman rights are intrinsically bound together, which is \n\n\n\f\nwhy we disagree with the argument that indiscriminate \ndestruction can be planned in order to then introduce \nreconstruction and reconciliation at somebody else\u2019s \nexpense. In that belief and in the face of such hidden and \ncomplex plans, I am pleased to declare before this world \nforum that Equatorial Guinea and its Government are \nwilling to host the next session of the United Nations \nStanding Advisory Committee on Security Questions \nin Central Africa, at a suitable date to be agreed on by \nthe parties.\n\nUncoordinated actions such as those I mentioned, \nwhich worsen global insecurity, are being carried out \ntoday, while the United Nations \u2014 whose role as arbiter \nand conciliator is being openly flouted by special \ninterests \u2014 looks on, powerless. Let us be honest with \nourselves, because democracy, as a just and equitable \nsystem, should prevail in all the organs of the United \nNations system, the epicentre of the international \ncommunity, aspiring to peace, order and development. \nWe therefore have no alternative but to reform those \norgans, particularly the Security Council, in order to \nmake them more democratic, so that they can protect \nthe interests of every nation impartially.\n\nWithin the framework of efforts to meet the \nMillennium Development Goals, the level of basic \ninfrastructure that has been created and the policy of \npromoting social institutions in Equatorial Guinea have \nresulted in a drop in the number of cases of malaria \nand in infant and maternal morbidity and mortality; in \nlower illiteracy rates; better technical and professional \ntraining; the increased empowerment of women; the \ngradual integration of persons with disabilities and a \nrise in the well-being of the people. Equatorial Guinea \nis contributing and collaborating actively with its \nNorth American partners, Noble Energy, Marathon and \nSanaria, with a view to completely eliminating malaria \nthrough the development of a vaccine that will be ready \nfor official use in 2017.\n\nIn order to work towards the main objective of \nthe theme for this session, which is \u201cThe post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage\u201d, Equatorial \nGuinea has adopted a development programme aimed \nat reaching the goals of an emerging country by 2020, \nwhich is now our priority. We therefore believe that \nEquatorial Guinea should move up gradually from its \nstatus as a least-developed country in order to achieve \nthat new rank in 2020.\n\nWhile that is the central theme of this session, \nto which we all must give our support, we also note \nthat the attention of the General Assembly should be \nfocused on the normalization of relations among States, \nnot only by adopting appropriate standards, but even \nmore by ensuring that our States apply them.\n\nWhile the African continent and other developing \ncountries strive to move towards sustainable \ndevelopment, they are unfortunately diverted from \ntheir efforts and forced to address man-made conflicts \nthat are fuelled by the surreal approaches to freedom, \ndemocracy and respect for human rights in Africa that \ncertain Powers are promoting. We are not convinced \nthat the United Nations has adopted a particular model \nof democracy that is applicable to all States. Africa is \nmore in need of special attention from the international \ncommunity to ensure its security, since it is now a \nbreeding ground for terrorist operations, mercenaries, \npirates and organized crime, due to the fragility of its \nstructures.\n\nThe United Nations should not cling to methods \nand practices that do not resolve conflict or meet the \ndesires of the people \u2014 or even worse, are a burden \nfor them. We are referring here to the use of force and \nembargoes, which always inflict great suffering on the \naffected peoples and deprive them of their most basic \nrights. That was not the purpose for which the United \nNations was established. We therefore call for the \nlifting of the embargoes imposed on the Republic of \nCuba and the Republic of Zimbabwe, as they harm the \nlives of their peoples.\n\nWith respect to armed conflict, the conflict between \nthe Israelis and the Palestinians has demonstrated the \ninability of the United Nations to impose solutions \nduring armed hostilities. However, we believe that \npolitically influential countries of the Middle East \ncan and should play a prominent role as arbitrators \nand mediators between the parties to the conflict. The \nsolutions have already been laid out by the United \nNations, and all that is needed is to implement them \nby ensuring respect for the limits set in 1967, because \nboth countries must coexist and need clearly defined \nborders.\n\nRegarding the situation in Syria, we regret \nand condemn the use of chemical weapons and the \nescalation of violence fuelled by opaque interests that \nare decimating a people because of alleged internal \nproblems. Wars have always bequeathed a negative \nbalance, and their victims tend to always be innocent \npeople. That is why we ask for an immediate cessation of \nhostilities and the withdrawal of the countries involved \n\n\n\f\nin the conflict, in order to honour and respect the Syrian \npeople and fulfil the United Nations responsibility to \nmaintain peace and security around the world. The only \ninterventions should be pacification and the destruction \nof chemical weapons, which the United Nations must \ndemand of the Syrian Government.\n\nRepetition implies concern, and indeed, in its \ncreation and in the framework of its Charter, the \nUnited Nations is seriously committed to maintaining \npeace and security in the world. It is also committed \nto promoting economic development, moral, human \nand material welfare, and relations of friendship, trust \nand cooperation among nations. But far from achieving \nthese goals, we continue to experience the horrors of \nwar on a daily basis, and to allow people to go hungry \nand nations to continue to live with the threat of \ninstability and espionage.\n\nIt is high time for us to stop this global misery in its \ntracks and look to our past while moving forward in a \nspirit of solidarity to forge a world that fulfils the hopes \nof humankind for well-being and happiness.\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to congratulate Mr. Ashe, the \nPresident of the General Assembly, and his friendly \ncountry, Antigua and Barbuda, on his election as \nPresident at the sixty-eighth session of the General \nAssembly. I wish him every success in conducting our \nwork through his major and neutral role as President of \nthe Assembly, like that of his predecessor, who avoided \nengaging the presidency in special political agendas.\n\nLast year when I addressed the Assembly (see \nA/67/PV.19), we were compelled to address many \nevents that had ravaged our country and our world. We \nwere full of hope that the scene would change for the \nbetter this year. Unfortunately, the situation remains \nthe same, and in some parts of the world has even \ndeteriorated. Many countries continue to face political, \neconomic and financial crises that exceed their ability \nto tackle them on their own. While the international \ncommunity looked forward to effective international \nefforts to overcome those crises, today we bear witness \nto exacerbated and intensified problems.\n\nThat exacerbation is due to the hegemony and \ndominion that thwart peoples\u2019 capabilities. Such \ndomination has escalated in a way that blatantly \ncontradicts the principles of the Charter of the United \nNations and the norms of international law. Instead of \nsettling regional and international conflicts by peaceful \nmeans, some well-known countries continue to pursue \naggressive policies against certain nations. Political \nhypocrisy allows them to intervene in the domestic \naffairs of States under the pretext of humanitarian \nintervention or the responsibility to protect. When \nsuch aggressive policies do not prove beneficial for \nthe countries subjected, including my own country, \nSyria, those well-known States reveal their true beliefs \nand threaten blatant military aggression outside the \nmandates of the Security Council and certainly well \nbeyond any international consensus.\n\nThose same countries impose immoral, illegal \nand unilaterally coercive economic measures. In \naddition, they maintain paranoid policies aimed at \nspreading sedition and turmoil within pluralistic, \nharmonious national communities that had previously \nlived for hundreds of years in harmony, unity and \nunderstanding. Worst of all, those countries have \nlaunched major, destructive wars under the pretext of \ncombating terrorism, even as they support terrorism \nin my country, in contravention of all United Nations \nresolutions and all human and moral values.\n\nI ask the same question I posed last year: Is the \ninternational consensus on combating terrorism a \nserious commitment undertaken by States Member of \nthe Organization, or is it mere rhetoric, written down \nbut not put into effect by certain countries?\n\nWhat is happening in my country has become clear \nto everyone. Yet some countries do not want to recognize \nthat Al-Qaida, the most dangerous terrorist organization \nin the world, and its many offshoots \u2014 including Jabhat \nAl-Nusra, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, \nthe Islamic Brigade and many others \u2014 are fighting \nin Syria. While scenes of murder, manslaughter and \neven the eating of human hearts were seen on television \nscreens worldwide, that did not affect the conscience of \nthose who chose to turn a blind eye. In my country, the \nheads of innocent civilians have been grilled because \nthey violated some extremist ideology and held views \nthat deviate from those of Al-Qaida. In my country, \nmurderers have dismembered human bodies while \nthe victims were still alive and sent their limbs to \ntheir families because those citizens were defending a \nunified and secular Syria.\n\nIn Syria \u2014 as in those countries that daily violate \nbasic human rights to life, livelihood and their own \nreligious beliefs and political affiliations \u2014 any Syrian \ncitizen who does not belong to that obscurantist takfiri \nideology is doomed to be killed or maimed or to \nwitness female relatives taken as captives on the basis \nof perverted concepts of religion that have nothing to \ndo with Islam.\n\n\n\f\nThere is no civil war in Syria. It is a war against \nterror, which does not recognize values, justice or \nequality and disregards all human rights and laws. \nTherefore, confronting terrorism in my country requires \nthe international community to act in accordance \nwith the relevant resolutions on counter-terrorism, \nparticularly Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). \nIt must take all necessary and immediate measures to \ncompel those countries that are known to finance, arm, \ntrain and provide safe haven and passage to terrorists \nfrom different countries to stop doing so.\n\nThe city of New York and its people have witnessed \nthe devastations of terrorism. They were burned by the \nfires of extremists and suffered bloodshed, just as we \nare suffering now in Syria. How can countries hit by \nthe same terrorism that we now suffer in Syria claim \nto be fighting terrorism throughout the world while \nsupporting it in my country? Claims of the existence \nof moderate militants and extremist militants have \nbecome a bad and senseless joke. Terrorism means only \nterrorism. It cannot be classified as moderate terrorism \nand extremist terrorism. What should we call those \nwho kidnap children in order to sell their body organs \noutside the country? How should we describe those \nwho recruit children and prevent them from going to \nschool and instead train them to shoot and kill? How \nwould one describe those who spread perverted fatwas \nconcerning sexual or incest-related jihad?\n\nWe were the ones targeted by poisonous gases in \nKhan al-Assal. We asked for an investigative mission \nand demanded that its mandate include the ability to \ndetermine who had used chemical weapons. However, \nthe United States of America and its friends the United \nKingdom and France prevented that and insisted that \nthe mission be limited to deciding whether or not \nchemical weapons had been used. In Syria, we waited \nfive months for the mission to come. When it arrived, \nit was withdrawn before the completion of its task \nas certain States had begun to beat the drums of war \nagainst Syria.\n\nMy country has accepted the praiseworthy \ninitiative launched by Mr. Vladimir Putin, President of \nthe Russian Federation. By acceding to the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, Syria has proved its commitment \nagainst the use of such weapons. Syria also calls on the \ninternational community to shoulder its responsibility \nagainst the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nin the Middle East. Syria is known for fulfilling its \nobligations and commitments. Therefore, I assure the \nAssembly of Syria\u2019s commitment to fully implementing \nthe provisions of the Convention and to cooperating \nwith the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical \nWeapons as a State party to the Convention.\n\nOne challenge that we all still face is not knowing \nwhether those who are supplying terrorists with such \nweapons will abide by their legal commitments, since \nthe terrorists who used poisonous gas in my country \nreceived chemical agents from countries of the region \nand the West that are well known to all of us. They \nare the ones using poisonous gas on our military and \ninnocent civilians alike.\n\nEnding aggressive policies towards Syria is the first \nappropriate step on the road to a solution in my country. \nIn the light of the continuing support being given to \nterrorism, whether in the form of arms, funding or \ntraining, any political solution will be misleading and a \nmere illusion. Syria has repeatedly stated that it is open \nto a political solution to its crisis. It is now up to those \nwho claim to support a political solution for Syria to \nhalt all practices and policies hostile to Syria and head \nto Geneva without preconditions.\n\nOn the basis of their national right to self-\ndetermination, the Syrian people have the \nexclusive authority to choose their leadership, their \nrepresentatives, their future and a political system \nthat will accommodate every sector of Syrian society, \nincluding those who have been deceived and beguiled \nonto the wrong path. We in Syria place no bets on any \nparty but the Syrian people, all of whom are determined \nto reject all foreign interference in their domestic affairs \nand to defeat the advocates of sectarianism, extremism \nand terrorism. In my country, State policies are firmly \ntied to the aspirations of the people. Ballot boxes for \nfree and fair elections remain the only way for the \nSyrian people to determine their own future, free from \nthe pressures of terrorism and foreign control.\n\nThere remain those who do not want a political \nsolution and always resort to aggression, either directly \nor through their agents on the ground. That is what is \nhappening in Syria. As I mentioned, Syria is committed \nto a political solution, but that does not mean allowing \nterrorists to attack innocent civilians. It does not mean \nwatching our mosques and churches be destroyed, as \nhas happened in Homs and Aleppo and is happening \nnow in the town of Malula, the only place in the world \nwhose people still speak the language of Jesus Christ. \nWhat is happening to the churches and mosques is also \n\n\n\f\naffecting the entire historical and cultural heritage of \nSyria and humankind.\n\nDo those representing the Member States in \nthe Assembly know that terrorists from more than \n83 countries are engaged in killing our people and our \narmy in the name of global takfiri jihad? Furthermore, \nare some Member States entitled to demand that the \nSyrian State ignore its constitutional responsibilities to \nprotect its citizens and preserve its unity, sovereignty \nand independence? The war on terror is not only Syria\u2019s \nwar. One day, those terrorists will return to their \ncountries, and then no country in the world will be \nsafe from that terrorism that recognizes no borders or \ngeography.\n\nThe events in Syria have created humanitarian \nneeds that continue to grow in several key sectors. The \nimmoral, inhumane and unilateral sanctions imposed \nby the United States and the European Union have \nworsened Syrian citizens\u2019 living conditions at a time \nwhen my Government is working with the United \nNations and international organizations within the \nframework of a response plan to meet the basic needs \nof citizens, particularly those who have been forced \nto leave their homes. It should be noted that many of \nour people have been forced to flee to neighbouring \ncountries in great numbers owing to the activities of \narmed terrorist groups in border areas. Regrettably, in \nsome of those countries displaced Syrians have been \nput in military training camps and places resembling \ndetention centres.\n\nFrom this rostrum, I appeal to Syrian citizens to \nreturn to their towns and villages, where the State will \nguarantee their safe return and dignified livelihood, \nfar from the inhumane conditions in such camps. I \nassure the Assembly of our readiness to make every \neffort to deliver aid from international organizations \nto all Syrian citizens without discrimination, wherever \nthey are, in compliance with resolution 46/182, while \nrespecting Syria\u2019s sovereignty and independence.\n\nThe developments in my country should not make \nus lose sight of Palestine and the Syrian Golan. The \nSyrian Arab Republic affirms its natural right to full \nsovereignty over the occupied Syrian Golan up to \nthe line of 4 June 1967, and emphasizes its rejection \nof all measures taken by Israel, the occupying Power, \nto change its natural demographic and geographic \nfeatures in clear violation of the relevant Security \nCouncil resolutions, particularly resolution 497 (1981). \nSyria also reaffirms its support for the legitimate and \ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people, particularly \ntheir rights of return and of self-determination, and \nto establish an independent State on their land, with \nJerusalem as its capital.\n\nNow that Syria has acceded to the Convention \non the Prohibition of the Development, Production, \nStockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on \nTheir Destruction, my country renews its call on the \ninternational community to work to establish a zone \nfree of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle \nEast. In that regard, we would remind the international \ncommunity of Syria\u2019s initiative, taken at the end of its \nnon-permanent membership of the Security Council in \n2003, and call on the Security Council to adopt it.\n\nSyria stresses that establishing a zone free of \nweapons of mass destruction in the Middle East will \nbe unachievable without the accession of Israel, \nthe only nuclear Power in the region, to all treaties \nbanning such weapons, and without its agreement to \nput its nuclear facilities under the supervision of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. At the same time, \nwe emphasize the right of all countries to acquire and \ndevelop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, in \naccordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \nof Nuclear Weapons. In that regard, Syria condemns \nthe fact that the United States and Israel continue to \nblock the holding of the international conference on \nestablishing a zone free of weapons of mass destruction \nin the Middle East that was scheduled to take place in \n2012.\n\nMy country calls on the United States, the countries \nof the European Union and others to refrain from taking \nimmoral unilateral economic measures that contravene \nthe rules of international law and the principles of free \ntrade. We therefore call for the lifting of the blockade \nthat has been imposed by the United States on Cuba for \ndecades. We also renew our call for lifting and ending \nall unilateral coercive measures imposed on Syria and \nthe peoples of countries such as Venezuela, Belarus, \nIran and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.\n\nWe hope that the United Nations will lead the \npeoples of the world towards a better future, so that \nthey may achieve their aspirations for prosperity, \ndevelopment and food self-sufficiency, free from all \nforms of tension, confrontation and war, thus fulfilling \nthe purposes and principles of the Charter of the United \nNations, which upholds the sovereignty and equality \n\nof all the rights and duties of all Member States. In \nthat regard, my country welcomes the efforts of the \nUnited States and Iran to bridge the gap of mistrust \nbetween the two countries, and hopes that this will be \nreflected constructively and positively in the stability \nof international relations.\n"

        "file_text": "It is my great honour \nto address the General Assembly on behalf of the \nRepublic of Serbia and inform members about the \npositions held by my country on some important global \nissues, developments in and around Serbia and the \nefforts that Belgrade has made with a view to reaching \na just solution to problems facing the country and its \nneighbourhood.\n\nFirst of all, I would like to thank the President of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session for his \nexcellent stewardship and organization of this debate \nand the leadership he has demonstrated in his high-level \npost. I wish him every success in the performance of his \nduties as President of the General Assembly. I assure \nhim that he will enjoy the support of the Republic of \nSerbia in the discharge of his mandate. He can count on \nour assistance in bringing his ideas to fruition.\n\nAt the same time, I would like to congratulate His \nExcellency Mr. Vuk Jeremic, former President of the \nGeneral Assembly, on his courage and impeccable \nwork in presiding over the Assembly for the past year \nand on the understanding he has demonstrated of the \nproblems encountered all over the world. He represented \nSerbia in a dignified manner while being an impartial \nprofessional of high standing.\n\nThe Republic of Serbia attaches great importance \nto the United Nations and the activities and cooperation \ncarried out within its framework. We remain true to \nthe Charter of the United Nations and the purposes and \nprinciples enshrined therein. We will endeavour, to the \nextent of our ability, to make a contribution to their \nimplementation.\n\nWe are also determined to participate in the new \ninitiatives being taken within the United Nations. I \nwelcome the well-chosen theme for this year\u2019s session. \nThe post-2015 development agenda and the preparations \nto be made in order to define a future global development \nframework are important issues, and the General \nAssembly is the right forum in which to hold these \ndiscussions and, more important, come to agreement \non them. I am confident that the current Assembly \nsession will be successful in the consideration of the \nagenda items highlighted by its President, namely, the \ncontribution of women, youth and civil society to the \n\n\f\npost-2015 development agenda and human rights and \nthe rule of law in that agenda.\n\nThe deadline for the implementation of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), to which \nthe Republic of Serbia fully subscribes, is fast \napproaching, and the United Nations and today\u2019s world \nare at a crossroads. The process that has been initiated \nis an ambitious and complicated one. Even the outcome \ndocument of the 2012 United Nations Conference on \nSustainable Development (resolution 66/288, annex), \nentitled \u201cThe future we want\u201d, makes it incumbent \nupon us to take action.\n\nI hope that the work of the Open Working Group on \nSustainable Development Goals will be a success. The \nRepublic of Serbia appreciates the opportunity given \nto it, as a member of the Group, to help in the drafting \nprocess aimed at establishing sustainable development \ngoals. For our part, we will do our utmost to contribute \nto defining sustainable development goals in clear \nterms. We believe that the sustainable development \ngoals should be global in nature but, at the same time, \nhave the capacity to be implemented in all countries, \nas countries differ so much in their capacity, level of \ndevelopment, priorities and policies.\n\nIt goes without saying that, in identifying the \nsustainable development goals, priority should be \naccorded to energy efficiency, renewable resources \nand climate change. Key development goals should \ndeal with sustainable economic development because, \nwithout it, it will be impossible to achieve social \ndevelopment, reduce hunger, poverty, unemployment \nand inequality, prevent further wage level disparities or \nprotect the environment.\n\nI expect that attention will also be focused on \nimplementing a global mechanism to prevent economic \nshocks from developed countries from spilling over to \ndeveloping countries and destabilizing international \nfinancial markets. As part of the process, voices \nfrom both \u201chave\u201d and \u201chave-not\u201d countries should be \nequally valued. Developing countries should highlight \nthe problems, and developed countries should act as \npartners in resolving them. \n\nAs a new member of the Economic and Social \nCouncil for the period 2014 to 2016, the Republic \nof Serbia will participate in all Council activities \nrelated to the MDGs and setting the stage of the post-\n2015 development agenda. However, there can be no \ndevelopment \u2014 sustainable, unsustainable, economic \nor social \u2014 in war-torn areas. \n\nEven today, at the outset of the twenty-first century, \nit is unfortunate that many war zones exist throughout \nthe world. My country has participated in United \nNations-led peacekeeping operations for decades. In \nmany continents, memories of Serbia\u2019s contributions to \npeace efforts remain very much alive. \n\nWe will continue to apply lessons learned to find \nsolutions to specific problems in the field and to improve \nour peacekeepers\u2019 response capacities in terms of the \nchallenges they will face in carrying out their mandates \nand with a view to achieving maximum performance. \n\nSerbian service and police personnel are engaged \nin multinational operations in the Congo, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, \nCyprus, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, \nLebanon, Liberia, Uganda, the Middle East and Somali \nwaters and soon in Mali as well. They all serve as \nproper representatives of their country through actions \nin favour of peace. \n\nWe are prepared to increase, in the coming period, \nthe size of our contribution and equipment in terms of \nnational contingents and to make use of the available \nUnited Nations standby arrangements. In line with our \npolicies based on Security Council resolutions, we will \nalso promote the participation of our servicewomen in \npeace missions.\n\nSerbia\u2019s engagement in United Nations missions \nand other multinational operations represents our firm \ncontribution to the maintenance of international peace \nand security. The Republic of Serbia has no ulterior \nmotive behind sending its troops to other countries, \nother than to provide assistance. For that reason, we \nwould like to see the personnel of the Serbian armed \nforces and the Ministry of the Interior welcomed and \naccepted both by the Governments of the friendly \ncountries to which they are deployed and the local \npopulations and that they would be seen as supportive \npartners, rather than as foreign troops and occupying \nforces.\n\nWhen seconding its personnel to multinational \noperations, Serbia has no interest \u2014 military, political \nor economic \u2014 but to help a friend in need and show \nthe other contingents contributing to the operation that \nour troops may be counted upon to help.\n\nApart from wars, there is another omnipresent \nglobal danger looming large over the core values of the \n\n\n\f\nUnited Nations. That danger is terrorism, which poses \na threat to fundamental human rights and creates an \nobstacle to business, thus undermining development as \nwell.\n\nAs a State party to most international counter-\nterrorism conventions, the Republic of Serbia attaches \ngreat significance to international activities aimed at \nsuppressing terrorism. And we are adapting our domestic \nlegislation to stem the scourge. We unequivocally \nsupport the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism \nStrategy and all of the relevant resolutions adopted by \nthe General Assembly and the Security Council. \n\nSerbia, as a victim of terrorist attacks that have \neven taken the lives of children \u2014 the most innocent \nsegment of its population \u2014 understands well the \nneed for regional and broader counter-terrorism \ncooperation. Because terrorism knows no boundaries, \nStates Members of the United Nations must be ready to \ncooperate without compromise, prejudice, or limitations \nand without any exceptions or special cases allowing \nterrorist actions against one\u2019s own people under the \npretext of so-called \u201cfreedom fighting\u201d. \n\nIn that context, it is of the utmost importance to \nmake progress on the adoption of a comprehensive \nconvention on international terrorism. Serbia strongly \ncondemns terrorism in any shape or form, without \nregard to who the perpetrators may be, wherever such \nacts may be committed or for whatever purpose.\n\nOn the other hand, no one has the right, Serbia \nincluded, to limit itself to statements made in \ncondemnation. Victims of terrorist acts worldwide, \nthose injured in attacks or the families of victims have \nthe right to demand that persons responsible for such acts \nbe brought to justice and that any further recruitment of \nterrorists or financing of their organizations end.\n\nThe Republic of Serbia attaches great importance \nto the promotion and protection of human rights and \nis striving to fully comply with the internationally \nrecognized standards in that area. Serbia has taken a \nstep forward regarding the enjoyment of human rights \nby minority groups, particularly national minorities, \nwomen and children and persons with special needs. \n\nSerbia\u2019s law on the protection of the rights and \nfreedoms of national minorities surpasses international \nconventions in many aspects. The Constitution of \nthe Republic of Serbia unambiguously prohibits the \nassimilation of national minorities and the undertaking \nof measures designed to artificially alter the ethnic \nstructure of populations in areas where national \nminorities traditionally reside in large numbers. \n\nThe Republic of Serbia is a multi-ethnic, \nmultireligious and multicultural country. Dozens of \nethnic groups and several religious communities live \nthere peacefully, and its tradition of living side by \nside based on tolerance and respect of others has been \nlong, genuine and deep-rooted. Drawing upon our own \nexperience, we have wholeheartedly embraced the \nAlliance of Civilizations initiative. We have actively \npromoted intercultural and interfaith dialogue in \nall domains and at all levels, as that is the best way \nto overcome divisions caused by cultural, linguistic, \nreligious or any other diversity. \n\nGenerally, in the period under review, Serbia has \nachieved considerable progress in the protection of \nhuman rights, as noted in the presentation of the second \nuniversal periodic review, in Geneva in January, and \nduring the visit to Belgrade by Ms. Navanethem Pillay, \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. \nWe are ready to share our expertise and experience \nin the human rights field with our friends around \nthe world. The Republic of Serbia considers such \ncooperation a friendly exchange, not interference in the \ninternal affairs of other countries or as one-sided and \nirresponsible preaching and tutelage accompanied by \nconditions or blackmail.\n\nThe Republic of Serbia is a party to nearly all \ninternational instruments and initiatives in the field \nof disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control. It \nfully complies with the obligations it has undertaken. \nSerbia\u2019s commitment to the Arms Trade Treaty, which \nwe recently signed, is based on the belief that the \nestablishment of legally binding international standards \nin that field is a significant contribution to eliminating \nthe illegal arms trade, fighting international terrorism \nand organized crime and promoting peace, security and \nstability \u2014 in other words, the alleviation of human \nsuffering. \n\nIn accordance with its agreed commitments, my \ncountry has counted and inventoried all weapons in \nits possession and has made the information available. \nIt has also allowed the inspection of its arsenals. Our \npartners know where each piece of Serbian weaponry \nis located. Nothing is kept secret. We have done so \nnot only because we were bound to do so, but to show \nand prove that Serbia is truly committed to peace and \ncooperation with its neighbours. \n\n\n\f\nContributions to peace can also be made through \ndisarmament. Never in its history has Serbia fought \na war of aggression, and the weapons now in its \npossession are only meant for its defence. Furthermore, \nSerbia has never posed a threat to any country. It has \nnever possessed weapons of mass destruction and has \nno intention of including weapons of mass destruction \nin its visible, quantifiable and verifiable arsenal.\n\nWe are aware that progress on disarmament and \narms control hinges not only on us. Success is related \nto developments carried out on a wider political and \nstrategic stage. \n\nIn the little more than one year since I took \noffice, I have visited almost all of the countries with \nborders in common with Serbia. I have spoken with the \nleaders of all of the neighbouring countries, including \nat international events. In that manner, I wanted to \nconvey the message that Serbia has opted for regional \ncooperation and working together with its neighbours \nto address the problems we share in common.\n\nOn behalf of Serbia, I have made symbolic gestures \nto effectively demonstrate that we wish to reconcile with \nthe peoples living side by side with us. I am confident \nthat those gestures will significantly contribute to \nreconciliation and help to right the wrongs of the past.\nWe are now looking forward to the future. It is our \ndesire to foster good relations with all neighbouring \ncountries by building a network of roads, railway lines \nand bridges; to try to make our mark on the international \nmarket; to promote our energy systems; to protect the \nenvironment; to cooperate in disaster relief; to develop \ncross-border projects; to have trade links and; to expand \nour cultural, scientific, educational, technological and \nsports cooperation. Our common goal is to improve the \nliving standards of everyone living in the countries of \nthe region.\n\nIn comparison with our neighbours, we can \ncompete only in terms of seeking to attain more human \nrights protection, whereas in all other respects, we will \ncooperate and help encourage one another to perform \nbetter. Serbia\u2019s message to its European partners is \nthat the time for conflicts, distrust and disputes is now \nbehind us. Our country is looking forward to the future \nand to becoming a member of the European Union. It \nhas been decided, and we trust that Serbia will start \nnegotiations with the European Union no later than \nJanuary 2014. I hope that Serbia will be able to inform \nthe next General Assembly session about the outcome \nof those talks, which we believe will not last long or \ncontinue indefinitely, as well as about Serbia\u2019s ongoing \nprogress towards becoming a fully fledged member \nof the European Union. At the same time, Serbia has \nrevived old alliances and forged new ones throughout \nthe world, creating strategic partnerships with countries \nin the East, West, North and South.\n\nSerbia has been active in all regional initiatives and \norganizations, and has recently chaired some of them, \nmaking a remarkable impression on other members. As \na result, the Organization for Security and Cooperation \nin Europe (OSCE) has entrusted Serbia with its \nchairmanship for 2015. The OSCE chairmanship, to \nbe held by Switzerland in 2014 and then by Serbia in \n2015, serves as a good example of how to cooperate \nwithin international organizations. It will give Serbia \nan opportunity to make a constructive contribution to \nthe enhancement of the OSCE, especially since 2015 \nwill mark the fortieth anniversary of the Helsinki Final \nAct, one of the most important OSCE instruments. We \nare confident that our activities on regional initiatives \nand our forthcoming chairmanship of the OSCE will \nmake Serbia an ideal candidate for taking on greater \nresponsibility within the United Nations system, \nconsequently making it possible for it to be entrusted \nwith even more responsibilities and duties, when the \ntime comes.\n\nThe unilaterally declared independence of Kosovo, \nin 2008, has been creating problems and undermining \na system established by the United Nations at its start. \nThe United Nations has never recognized an illegal \nsecession attempt by Kosovo\u2019s provisional institutions \nof self-governance, but a number of countries, \nirrespective of the norms of international law, have \nrecognized Kosovo as an independent State. Under \nconstant pressure and through blackmail on the part \nof large and powerful States, some other countries, \nincluding Serbia\u2019s traditional allies, have unfortunately \nrecognized Kosovo as an independent State. \n\nSerbia has responded to such acts in a measured, \ndiplomatic and political manner, refraining from \nany use of force, to safeguard its sovereignty and its \nterritorial integrity. Faced with a situation where its \nvital national interests were at stake, a country would \nrarely demonstrate such a degree of level-headedness.\n\nWe are convinced that such problems, including \nthe status of Kosovo and Metohija, should be resolved \npeacefully. For that reason, we take heed of calls by \nthe General Assembly in 2010 to start negotiations with \nrepresentatives of the authorities in Pristina. Following \n\n\n\f\nthe efforts of Lady Catherine Ashton, European Union \nHigh Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security \nPolicy, we have made arrangements with the Albanians \nof Kosovo and Metohija. Serbia has thus shown that its \nintention was to protect the Serb community in Kosovo \nand Metohija as far as possible, to ensure that all its \ninhabitants in the southern Serbian province of Kosovo \ncould also lead normal lives on a day-to-day basis. \n\nLet us underscore that Belgrade and Pristina have \nonly reached agreement over clearly defined matters, \nsuch as local elections and the establishment of a \ncommunity of Serbian boroughs in Kosovo and Metohija, \nand that the Republic of Serbia has not recognized the \nindependence of Kosovo in any shape or form. The first \nagreement, which we promised to respect fully, does \nnot mean in any way that the Republic of Serbia intends \nto approve Kosovo\u2019s entry into the United Nations and \nother international organizations, where membership is \nthe sole prerogative of sovereign States. \n\nThe United Nations has been present in Kosovo \nand Metohija for more than 14 years. We believe \nin the United Nations, which was entrusted with \nadministering this part of Serbia in 1999. Therefore, \nwe ask that the mandate of the United Nations Interim \nAdministration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) remain \nunchanged, that its staff not be downsized and that its \nactivities be reinforced. UNMIK plays an indispensable \nrole. It should coordinate the work of all international \nforces present in Kosovo and Metohija within a neutral \nframework, as stated in Security Council resolution \n1244 (1999). That resolution defined the tasks of \nthe United Nations and reaffirmed that Kosovo and \nMetohija is a province forming an integral part of the \nRepublic of Serbia.\n\nWe also support the work of the European Union \nRule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX). We request \nthat the European Union respect its own principles as far \nas the province of Kosovo and Metohija is concerned. \nWe expect EULEX, by maintaining a neutral approach, \nto continue assisting in the development of democratic \ninstitutions within the province and in monitoring the \nhuman rights of Serbs and other non-Albanians, since \nonly their fundamental human rights are under threat.\n\nAs far as Serbia is concerned, there is yet another \npending task before the United Nations weighing on \nthe conscience of its Member States, one which must \nnot remain unaddressed, so that neither we nor future \nPresidents have to seek justice by repeating that a crime \nremains to be resolved. We wish to recall that special \nrapporteur Dick Marty, a Swiss senator, has shown, and \nthe Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe \nhas confirmed, that some Albanian leaders in Kosovo \nand Metohija organized the kidnapping and killing \nof Serbs whose organs were then harvested and sold \nillegally. We were not in a position to initiate legal \nproceedings for those crimes, which were committed \ntowards the beginning of the twenty-first century, \ncrimes that have so far not occurred anywhere else in \nthe world. We still believe that it is necessary for the \nUnited Nations to be included in investigating those \ncrimes, based on a report by the Council of Europe. \nSerbia appeals for the support of friends in its efforts to \nshed light on the truth behind those and other crimes so \nthat the perpetrators can be brought to justice. \n\nIn April, I spoke before the Assembly in the thematic \ndebate on the role of the international criminal justice \nsystem in reconciliation and about the work of the \nInternational Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons \nResponsible for Serious Violations of International \nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of \nthe Former Yugoslavia since 1991 (ICTY). We said \nthen that the ICTY had abused the mandate given to \nit by the Security Council; that it had not helped the \nreconciliation process in the territory of the former \nYugoslavia; that it had compromised the idea behind the \ninternational criminal justice system; that it had acted \nunder political pressure; that it was not independent; that \nit had acted differently in similar circumstances; that it \nhad acquitted some war criminals, in some instances \neven failing to indict them; that it had humiliated Serb \nvictims of the secession wars of the former Yugoslavia; \nand that it had attempted to paint a revisionist picture \nof history. We continue to hold the same points of view. \n\nBy accepting the integrity of the Tribunal, we \nhave not only earned the right to criticize its work \nbut also to propose a solution. Nevertheless, while \nits intention was not just to criticize this institution, \nSerbia suggested certain measures that might, to some \nextent, help redress the wrongdoings of the Tribunal. \nWe request the United Nations and the ICTY to find a \nlegal solution that ensures that Serb convicts are sent \nto serve their prison sentence in Serbia, so that justice \nmay be done more effectively, primarily as a way of \nhelping them reintegrate into society. That does not \nmean that we challenge the verdicts reached or that we \nare minimizing the crimes committed by those persons. \nWe simply want to help those concerned return to \nnormal life, once they come out of prison, as part of the \nSerbian community.\n\n\n\f\nSerbia respects every State Member of the United \nNations and offers each and every one of them its \nfriendship and trust. We expect that to be reciprocated \nin equal measure. The Serbia of today and tomorrow \ndeserves to be trusted. \n"

        "file_text": "I stand in the \nHall today as the leader of one of the smallest countries \nin the world \u2014 small by size, population and resources. \nI also stand here today with a proud heart and a strong \nvoice because my small country of Antigua and \nBarbuda has produced a giant in the world\u2019s geopolitical \nsphere. He is among the finest and most accomplished \ndiplomats to have ever walked these great halls. The \nGovernment and people of Antigua and Barbuda send \ncongratulations to His Excellency Ambassador John \nWilliam Ashe on his election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. We are beyond \nsure that he will guide this body through a successful \nsession. I offer congratulations also to his predecessor, \nHis Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremi., on a job well done \nand for his unrelenting service to the international \ncommunity.\n\nExactly five years ago today, I stood in this \nhallowed Hall and stated that: \n\n\u201cWe are all members of one body. The welfare \nof the weakest and the welfare of the most powerful \nare inseparably bound together. Industry cannot \nflourish if labour languishes. Transportation \ncannot prosper if manufacturing declines. The \ngeneral welfare cannot be provided for in any one \nact, but it is well to remember that the benefit of \none is the benefit of all, and the neglect of one is the \nneglect of all.\u201d (A/64/PV.7, p. 32)\nWith the ever-increasing gaps in equality among \nnations, the challenges for developing countries over \nthe years have remained vast. In trying to address \nthe issue of inequality and to diminish very basic \nhuman challenges by 2015, world leaders adopted \nthe Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) and \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The \nMDGs were described as a milestone in international \ncooperation. With a 15-year timespan for their \nimplementation, the Declaration was widely expected \nto inspire development and to directly improve the lives \nof hundreds of millions of people. They are the people \nwho are struggling to survive in the most basic living \nconditions and who are suffering from the effects of \npoverty, gender inequities, ill health and environmental \ndegradation.\n\nThirteen years have gone by, and what do we, as a \nglobal community, have to show in terms of concrete \nresults? No matter which side of the lens we look \nthrough, something is appallingly wrong. With less \nthan two years to go before 2015, we must ask ourselves \nas leaders why those commitments, related to the most \nsignificant global declaration made to the world\u2019s most \nvulnerable people, are not being fulfilled.\n\nIt is important for me to be extremely clear. I am \nnot here to declare the MDGs dead, nor am I advocating \nthat they be interred. Rather, I remain convinced that \nthey can still be refocused, reformed, reshaped and \nrebranded into a new mechanism post-2015.\n\nWe find ourselves standing at the precipice of 2015, \nthat crucial defining moment. The current moment \nis captured by notable but uneven developments in \nsome crucial areas. Considerable gaps remain and new \nchallenges have emerged. As leaders we must therefore \nacknowledge that now more than ever, through the \nprocess of globalization, individuals and societies \nfrom one corner of the Earth to another, from oceans \nand continents, are intricately connected and more \ninterdependent than ever before. Therefore, a post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda must concede that fact and be \nguided by that reality. \n\nThe deliberations for international collaboration \nand development ahead of 2015 present the opportunity \nto redirect previous notions of prosperity and \ndevelopment among nations. Considering the current \nworld economic, social and environmental challenges, \nthat is indisputably critical.\n\nWe must concede that the current structure of the \ninternationally agreed development goals does not \nprovide satisfactory remedies to our universal problems, \nwhich include an increase in global warming, the \nescalating gap between the worlds\u2019s rich and the poor, \nthe further deterioration of the world\u2019s financial system \nand the uneven roles that developed and developing \ncountries play in responding to and addressing issues \nof universal importance and impact on our societies. \nTaking into account some of those shortcomings, now \nis the opportune time for setting the stage for a post-\n2015 development agenda that is all-inclusive, effective \nand pragmatic.\n\nOf concern to Antigua and Barbuda are the failings \nof the international community in fulfilling the aims \nand objectives outlined in the Barbados Programme \nof Action for the Sustainable Development of Small \n\n\n\f\nIsland Developing States (SIDS). The year 2014 will \nmark the twentieth anniversary of the first Global \nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small \nIsland Developing States, which was held in Barbados \nin 1994. \n\nLooking back over the 20 years since that \nConference, we see that the international community\u2019s \nactions to address the unique and special circumstances \nof SIDS have been lacking. It is my hope that the SIDS \nconference in Samoa in 2014 will give the international \ncommunity the opportunity to correct the wrongs made \nand to improve on shortcomings with regard to SIDS. \nThe conference will also present us with a third chance \nto identify a set of concrete actions, which will be \nneeded for the further implementation of the Barbados \nProgramme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy for \nImplementation and thereby regain momentum lost by \nSIDS in the quest for sustainable development.\n\nWe welcome the decision by the United Nations \nfamily to designate 2014 as the International Year of \nSmall Island Developing States. Antigua and Barbuda \npledges to highlight throughout 2014 the issue of SIDS \nwith the aim of reinvigorating the SIDS agenda.\n\nMy Government firmly believes in promoting \npartnerships supporting sustainable development based \non the principles of mutual respect and understanding, \nequality and a genuine desire to affect the social and \neconomic development of all. My Government has \ndeepened our integration efforts with our Caribbean \nCommunity (CARICOM) brothers and sisters, focusing \non fully implementing the CARICOM Single Market \nand Economy, as well as deepening the various \nsubregional regulatory frameworks.\n\nAs a member of the smaller grouping of the \nOrganization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), \nAntigua and Barbuda has fully joined and endorsed the \nOECS economic union in an effort to build on the shared \ntradition of our subregional integration arrangements \nand to expand the areas of shared sovereignty in order \nto survive and ultimately thrive. At the same time, \nmy Government has secured full participation in the \nBolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America \nand the Community of Latin American and Caribbean \nStates, as we seek to further strengthen the integration \nand development of Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nIt is a recognized fact, but one worth repeating, that \nsmall island States contribute the least to the causes \nof climate change yet suffer the most from its effects. \nWe small island States have expressed our profound \ndisappointment at the lack of tangible action within \nthe negotiations on the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change to protect SIDS and \nother vulnerable countries, their peoples, culture, \nland and ecosystems. The responsibility for mitigating \nclimate change is shared by all nations, developed \nand developing. However, developed countries \nshould shoulder their moral, ethical and historical \nresponsibility for emitting anthropogenic greenhouse \ngases into the atmosphere. It is those actions that have \nnow put the planet in jeopardy and compromised the \nwell-being of present and future generations.\n\nVulnerable developing societies such as ours are \nalso victims of the globalization of crime, notably \nin the havoc wrought by handguns in the possession \nof criminal elements, by narcotrafficking that is \nessentially targeted at markets in developed countries \nand by the deportation of criminals to our shores. We \nurge the international community, in recognition of \nthe link between globalization and crime, to provide \ngreater support for the efforts of small island States \nsuch as Antigua and Barbuda to address the escalation \nof crime and strengthen the rule of law in combating \ninternational drug trafficking. We further call on our \ndeveloped partners to reduce the practice of deporting \nviolent criminals to our shores. Most of those deportees \nhave neither connection nor familiarity with our \ncountries.\n\nAntigua and Barbuda is proud to be among \nthe growing number of States that have signed and \nratified the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). The Treaty \nwill, among other things, assist Antigua and Barbuda \nin enhancing its capacity to tackle the scourge created \nby the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons \nand their ammunition, which is associated with other \ntransboundary crimes, such as drug trafficking. We have \nemphasized throughout the process that such crimes \nhave had a negative impact on the socioeconomic well-\nbeing of our societies. Antigua and Barbuda stresses \nthe importance of the early entry into force of the ATT \nand will continue to work energetically with Member \nStates to ensure its entry into force.\n\nAnother threat to the sustainable development of \nsmall island developing States such as Antigua and \nBarbuda is the rise in non-communicable diseases \n(NCDs). The situation is at an alarming stage, as \nhundreds succumb annually. For Antigua and Barbuda, \nthe prevention, care and treatment of non-communicable \n\n\n\f\ndiseases continue to be a challenge. Heart disease, \ndiabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease and chronic \nrespiratory diseases continue to be the leading causes of \ndeath in our region. Our health-care system, economy \nand population are heavily burdened by NCDs; it is for \nthat reason that my Government has become even more \nproactive in addressing the issue. Health care continues \nto be basically free for Antiguans and Barbudans, and \nthe Government often helps citizens seek treatment \nabroad when our facilities at home are unable to provide \nit. I ask the Assembly to continue to keep the issue of \nNCDs high on its agenda.\n\nMy small developing nation of Antigua and Barbuda \nhas sought to ensure that the trade rules agreed to by a \nmajority of members of the international community, \nincluding the United States of America, are adhered \nto. I take this opportunity to once again draw the \nAssembly\u2019s attention to a trade dispute between my \ncountry and the United States of America that has been \nongoing for a decade and which has been submitted \nto the dispute settlement system of the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO). I draw the Assembly\u2019s attention \nto the dispute because I believe it has the potential to \ndamage the credibility and undermine the utility of \nthe WTO\u2019s dispute settlement system and of the WTO \nitself. \n\nMy Government won the case at both the original \nand appellate levels and yet, a decade later, the end \nis not in sight. It is a case that pits the world\u2019s largest \neconomy against one of the smallest, and despite our \nbest efforts, our patient negotiations with the United \nStates of America have borne no fruit. The United States \nof America has neither removed the offending laws nor \nagreed on a fair settlement with Antigua and Barbuda \nthat would compensate for the wanton destruction of an \nentire economic sector. We believe that it is a blow to \nthe credibility of the WTO to allow the world\u2019s largest \neconomy and the WTO\u2019s most powerful member to \nignore the lawful decision of its dispute settlement \ntribunal without consequences. The international \ntrading system will not long survive such a profound \nchallenge, and we call on the United States to correct \npast wrongs and come to the table with meaningful \nproposals that can bring the matter to a just conclusion. \n\nAlthough my Government has until now \nexercised strategic patience, we intend, through the \nonly mechanism that the WTO has provided, to seek \ncompensation for the thousands of jobs lost, the \ncompanies collapsed and the general devastation of the \nsecond-largest sector of our economy after tourism. \nMore than jobs are at stake here. The WTO must be \nseen to deliver justice to its members, especially one \nof its smallest constituents. If not, its credibility as the \narbiter of international trade disputes will bleed into \nthe dust and hollow out its noble intentions.\n\nAs a part of the Caribbean and a member of the \nCARICOM family, Antigua and Barbuda supports the \npreservation of the sovereignty of every nation. We are \ntherefore very proud of our long-standing relationship \nwith the Republic of Cuba. My Government condemns \nin the strongest possible terms any discriminatory or \nretaliatory policies and practices designed to prevent \nCuba from exercising its right to freely participate \nin the affairs of our hemisphere. Today, I once again \nreiterate my Government\u2019s firm condemnation of the \nunilateral and extraterritorial application of coercive \nlaws and measures contrary to international law, the \nCharter of the United Nations and the principles of \nfree navigation and international trade. Antigua and \nBarbuda therefore urges the United States of America \nto respect and take note of the unceasing call by the \nMembers of the United Nations that it immediately \nlift the unjust economic, commercial and financial \nblockade imposed on the Republic of Cuba. These and \nother associated measures serve no other end than to \nhinder the socioeconomic development and well-being \nof the people of the Republic of Cuba.\n\nAntigua and Barbuda also affirms its long-standing \nstance and commitment towards combating terrorism \nin all its forms and expressions and condemns any \naction which goes against international law, resolutions \nof the United Nations or principles of human rights \nprotection. We therefore condemn the recent terrorist \nacts in Kenya and express our profound sympathy to \nthe Government of President Uhuru Kenyatta and the \nfamilies of those who lost loved ones. We also in the \nstrongest sense condemn acts of terrorism in other \nparts of the world.\n\nAntigua and Barbuda also expresses its concern \nabout the inclusion of the Republic of Cuba on the list \nof State sponsors of terrorism published by the State \nDepartment of the United States of America. We reject \nthe unilateral elaboration of blacklists accusing States \nof allegedly supporting and sponsoring terrorism, \nwhich is inconsistent with international law. We request \nthe United States of America to put an end to that \nunilateral practice.\n\n\n\f\nAntigua and Barbuda welcomes the launch of the \ndesign for a permanent memorial to honour the victims \nof slavery and the transatlantic slave trade, an initiative \nthat was championed by CARICOM. We also look \nforward to its full erection in the coming months.\n\nOne year ago, I stood here and reiterated the need \nfor serious dialogue on the topic of reparations. Today \nI am proud that the members of CARICOM, at its \nthirty-fourth Regular Meeting of the Conference of \nHeads of Government, held in Trinidad and Tobago in \nJuly, agreed to support the establishment of a regional \nreparations commission to begin laying the groundwork \nfor a process of engagement and conversation on the \nissue of reparations for native genocide and slavery.\n\nI am equally pleased that the first regional \nreparations conference was held in St. Vincent and the \nGrenadines earlier this month, with proposals for the \nformalization of a regional reparations commission. \nAntigua and Barbuda therefore conceptualizes the \ncall for reparations as an integral element of our \ndevelopment strategy and believes that the legacy of \nslavery and colonialism in the Caribbean has severely \nimpaired our development options. We therefore assert \nthat reparations must be directed towards repairing the \ndamage inflicted by slavery and racism.\n\nWe have recently seen a number of leaders \napologizing to the African diaspora, to indigenous \npeoples and to former colonies for past wrongs and \ninjustices. I salute those leaders who have demonstrated \nsuch enlightenment and strongly encourage others to \ndo so and equally match their words with concrete and \nmaterial benefits to the descendants of genocide and \nthe brutal enslavement of their ancestors.\n\nMy country, while developmentally focused, \nis mindful of other global issues, particularly with \nreference to peace and security. The continued unrest in \nthe Middle East, particularly in Syria, is heartbreaking. \nThe images of innocent women and children being \ndisplaced and killed tug at my consciousness. Antigua \nand Barbuda gives its unconditional support to the \npreservation of the role of the United Nations and other \norganizations in working towards stabilization and \npeace in Syria and other conflict-ridden countries.\n\nIn the same vein, we call on those leaders to \nprotect civilians at all costs and move quickly to \ndevise diplomatic solutions to the conflicts. Wilful \nand deliberate attacks upon civilians should be taken \nseriously by the international community, and the \ninternational courts should move to act in a manner \nconsistent with international laws and norms.\n\nWar, or even the threat of war, should be an \nabsolute last resort and should have the full support \nof the international community at all times. Unilateral \nprescriptions will never solve a problem.\n\nWe cannot successfully achieve a post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda if world leaders stand idle and \nsee the tears and desperation on the faces of the many \nchildren who are hungry. We cannot successfully \nachieve a post-2015 development agenda if world \nleaders allow easily treatable illnesses and diseases to \ndestroy our populations.\n\nWe cannot successfully achieve a post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda if world leaders sit back and allow \nthe lines of class divisions and insurmountable social \nbarriers to increase.\n\nWe cannot successfully achieve a post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda if world leaders continue to \nallow the imbalances of economic growth, destructive \ntrade barriers and protectionism from developed to \ndeveloping countries to persist. \n\nWe cannot successfully achieve a post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda if world leaders do not act to save \nour environment and stop the pollution of our air and \noceans and the wanton destruction of our forests and \nlands only for the benefit of a few.\n\nWhen the founders of the United Nations formulated \nthis great institution, it was not envisioned as a stage or \na repository for eloquent speeches. The United Nations \nwas conceptualized as a place where our challenges \nwould be discussed, solutions cultivated and action \ntaken.\n\nIt is for those reasons that our leaders gathered here \ntoday should work towards a fundamental, impartial \nand sustainable social, economic and environmental \npost-2015 development agenda that is far-reaching and \nall-inclusive. Anything less would be unacceptable \nand would be a travesty for millions of the world\u2019s \ninhabitants, for whom we are required to act and do so \ncourageously and decisively.\n"

        "file_text": "At the \noutset, I would like to join with those expressing their \ncordial congratulations to Mr. John Ashe on his election \nto serve as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-eighth session. I am convinced that his extensive \nprofessional experience will contribute to the efficient \nand successful work of this session. I would also like \nto express our appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Vuk \nJeremi., for his efforts as President at the previous \nsession.\n\nWe fully share the commitment of this session to \ncontributing to the development of a post-2015 global \ndevelopment agenda in order to enhance the progress \nalready achieved towards the full implementation of the \ndecisions taken at the Rio de Janeiro United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20).\n\nThe modalities of the High-level Political Forum on \nSustainable Development were approved at the sixty-\nseventh session of the General Assembly, and its first \nmeeting took place some days ago here in New York. \nWe expect the Forum, which replaces the Commission \non Sustainable Development, to become a universal and \neffective platform for regular dialogue and for reviewing \nachievements and developing and coordinating the \nprogramme of actions aimed at promoting sustainable \ndevelopment.\n\nFurther progress in achieving sustainable \ndevelopment depends in many respects on the adequate \nand timely financing of the planned programmes \nand projects. In that regard, the activities of the \nIntergovernmental Committee of Experts on Sustainable \nDevelopment Financing, which is mandated to develop \nrecommendations on effective strategies for financing \nsustainable development, are of key importance.\n\nWe support efforts to develop a sustainable \ndevelopment goal for water resources. We believe that \nthe following should be taken into consideration in that \nregard: ensuring universal access to safe drinking water \nand sanitation, introducing the integrated management \nof water resources at the national and regional levels, \nincreasing the efficiency of water use and secondary use \nof water, adequately financing and investing in water-\neconomy facilities and infrastructure, transferring and \nintroducing advanced technologies, and setting up \nmutually acceptable mechanisms for the gathering and \ndissemination of information and data.\n\nAs stated in the Rio+20 outcome document, \n\u201cwater is at the core of sustainable development as it \nis closely linked to a number of key global challenges\u201d \n(resolution 66/288, annex, para. 119). The water-\nrelated resolutions of the General Assembly initiated \nby Tajikistan and co-sponsored by other Member States \nhave made an invaluable contribution to the realization \nof the key role of water resources in the achievement \nof sustainable development. This year marked the tenth \nanniversary of our first global project, the International \nYear of Freshwater, in 2003. The General Assembly \ntook another important decision when it proclaimed \n2005-2015 the International Decade for Action, \u201cWater \nfor Life\u201d (resolution 58/217). \n\nIn 2010, Tajikistan initiated the General Assembly \nresolution that declared 2013 the International Year of \nWater Cooperation (resolution 65/154). When promoting \nthat resolution in conjunction with other countries, we \noperated on the assumption that the events during that \nInternational Year would contribute to strengthening \ndialogue and mutual understanding and enhancing \ncooperation and partnership on the basis of multilevel \nand comprehensive approaches towards solving water \nproblems. Most important of all, we expected that \nthe International Year of Water Cooperation would \nbecome a major platform for consolidating efforts and \nimproving our treatment of water resources. \n\nToday, it is still too early to draw conclusions \nregarding the outcome of the Year. However, I would like \nto note that the International Year of Water Cooperation \nhas provided a truly unique opportunity to promote \nthe dialogue on the search for and establishment of \na just, mutually advantageous and effective water \ncooperation system. It is specifically that idea that \nwas the focus of the statements and reports of the \n\n\n\f\nparticipants at the High-level International Conference \non Water Cooperation, organized by the Government \nof Tajikistan in cooperation with the United Nations on \n20 and 21 August in Dushanbe. I would like to take this \nopportunity to extend our appreciation to the President \nof the General Assembly, the Secretary-General and all \nour partners \u2014 Member States and international and \nregional organizations \u2014 for their active participation \nin the work of that successful Conference. \n\nBased on the outcomes of the Conference, the \nDushanbe Declaration of the High-level International \nConference on Water Cooperation and the Dushanbe \nframework for action on water cooperation were issued \nand circulated among Member States as documents of \nthe General Assembly. In his statement at the opening \nceremony of the Dushanbe Conference, the President \nof the Republic of Tajikistan, Mr. Emomali Rahmon, \nproposed the development of a post-2015 vision for \nglobal water, which could serve as the road map for \nthe implementation of the water-related sustainable \ndevelopment goals. We would like to call upon all \ndelegations to support that initiative.\n\nIt is common knowledge that water resources are \ncentral to the achievement of the development goals set \nforth in the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). \nOur efforts at poverty eradication directly depend on \nthe rational management of water resources. The efforts \nundertaken have not yet produced the large-scale effects \nthat we all expected at the dawn of the Millennium. \nHowever, the progress is obvious. According to The \nMillennium Development Goals Report 2013, over the \npast two decades, more than 2.1 billion people have \nreceived access to improved drinking water supplies and \n1.9 billion people improved their sanitation conditions. \nDespite those statistics, 768 million people are still \nusing water from unsafe sources and about 2.5 billion \npeople do not have access to basic sanitation. Moreover, \nthe level of progress differs, not only in regions and \ncountries, but also in rural and urban areas within the \nsame country.\n\nThe special General Assembly event that took place \nrecently in New York provided another opportunity \nfor a sound assessment of progress and identification \nof ways to accelerate implementation of the MDGs \nand do so with maximum success. That is particularly \nimportant under current circumstances, when the \nfinancial, economic, food and energy crises and climate \nchange undermine the current still unsustainable and \nuneven progress in the implementation of MDGs.\n\nExperience shows that it is impossible to achieve \ndevelopment goals without ensuring reliable and \nuniversal access to energy. The United Nations Decade \nof Sustainable Energy for All (2014-2024) provides a \nunique opportunity for the practical implementation of \nthat aim. We believe that, along with ensuring reliable \nand sustainable access to energy, it is essential to \nencourage and promote in every way possible increased \nuse of renewable energy, the transfer of advanced \ntechnologies and a more efficient energy supply and \nenergy saving. Tajikistan, which is experiencing \neconomic and population growth, lacks large oil and \ngas deposits but has huge hydropower potential. It is \nmaking every effort to develop all aspects of power \ngeneration, on which the population\u2019s well-being \ncritically depends. \n\nOur Government is undertaking additional efforts \nto make full use of its own potential when it comes \nto addressing socioeconomic issues. On 2 March, \nTajikistan successfully completed the negotiation \nprocess and joined the World Trade Organization as the \none hundred and fifty-ninth member of that multilateral \nsystem for regulating world trade. We are interested in \nadvancing the trade interests of developing countries, \nincluding those of landlocked countries. \n\nIn that context, on 16 and 17 September in Dushanbe, \nthe tenth annual meeting of the Intergovernmental \nCommission for the Transport Corridor \nEurope-Caucasus-Asia was held. That meeting \nwas followed on 18 September by the High-level \nInternational Conference on Development of Road \nTransport and Transit Potential in Central Asia for the \nperiod up to 2023. Those events made an additional \ncontribution to the process of preparing for the 10-year \ncomprehensive review of the implementation of the \nAlmaty Programme of Action.\n\nEffective regional cooperation can provide \nconsiderable support to the establishment of a new global \npartnership for achieving sustainable development. \nIn our region, the development of multidimensional \ncooperation depends in many respects on strengthening \npeace and stability in Afghanistan. We support the \nefforts of the Government of Afghanistan and the \ninternational community to address the challenges \nof the transition period, reconciliation and post-\nconflict rehabilitation in Afghanistan. We believe that \nsocioeconomic development is the key to achieving \nlasting peace in that country. International aid to \nAfghanistan should be, above all, aimed at promoting \n\n\n\f\na full economic recovery, further strengthening the \nsocial sphere and generating new jobs. \n\nThe borders with Afghanistan\u2019s neighbouring \ncountries should be considered the front line in \ncombating drug-trafficking and, in that regard, efforts \nwith respect to their logistical strengthening and the \nprompt creation of a modern and effective Afghan \nborder police presence should be stepped up. There \nis an urgent need for Afghanistan to be fully included \nin the multidimensional regional cooperation process. \nInvolving the neighbouring countries in the development \nof Afghanistan and giving due consideration to the \nregional context in the post-conflict rehabilitation \nof the country will guarantee success in the ongoing \nefforts undertaken by the world community.\n\nIt is clear that illicit drug trafficking has become \none of the major sources of financing of international \nterrorism. The urgency and magnitude of the problems \nassociated with drugs and illicit drug trafficking are \nclear indications of the global danger threatening \ninternational stability and security as a whole. The \ninternational community must unify its efforts to reduce \nthe supply of and demand for drugs and its efforts \naimed at integrating national and regional efforts into \nthe international drug-control strategy. \n\nDuring the period of its membership in the United \nNations Commission on Narcotic Drugs, 2014 to 2017, \nTajikistan will strengthen and expand its interaction \nwith other Member States and international and \nregional organizations in practical implementation of \nthe international conventions on drugs and the Political \nDeclaration and Plan of Action on International \nCooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced \nStrategy to Counter the World Drug Problem. \n\nCombating terrorism is a long-term and complicated \njoint task that will require strengthening by applying \nthe entire spectrum of political, economic and \nfinancial measures. We deem it important to expedite \nthe coordination and adoption of a comprehensive \nanti-terrorism convention. Regional and subregional \norganizations capable of providing support to the \nglobal system for combating international terrorism \nmust play an important role in combating terrorism and \nextremism.\n\nIn recent years, Tajikistan has intensified its \ninteraction with United Nations law enforcement \nmechanisms, including the special procedures of the \nHuman Rights Council. The country\u2019s main priorities \nin this field are the strengthening of international \nmechanisms for the protection of human rights, the \nbona fide implementation of the commitments assumed \nand the promotion of multilateral cooperation in the \nfield of human rights protection. We view the Human \nRights Council as an important forum for constructive \ndialogue and cooperation in the field of human rights.\n\nGuided by the desire to make a contribution \nto an open and fair dialogue in the field of human \nrights, Tajikistan has for the first time decided to put \nforward its candidature for the Human Rights Council \nfor the period 2015 to 2017. We hope that Tajikistan\u2019s \ncandidature for that period will receive support at the \nelection to be held during the sixty-ninth session of the \nGeneral Assembly, in the fall of 2014.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to note that the entire \nrange of long-term goals requires a clear and sound \nreview of the actions under way towards a transition \ntowards sustainable development. We are convinced \nthat the United Nations, as the unique, universal \nmechanism for multilateral cooperation, must remain \nthe centre of coordination of our collective efforts to \nensure peace, security, development and human rights. \nMeanwhile, the role of the United Nations itself must \nbe strengthened through comprehensive reform and by \nenhancing its ability to rapidly and adequately respond \nto problems, effectively meet the numerous global \nchallenges and counter threats.\n"

        "file_text": "It is with much \npride that the Government and the people of the Solomon \nIslands join me in congratulating a fellow islander, \nAmbassador John Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda, on \n\nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-eighth session. As one of his Vice-Presidents, we \nassure him of Solomon Islands\u2019 support and cooperation \nduring his tenure in office.\n\nI take this opportunity to commend his predecessor, \nMr. Vuk Jeremi. of Serbia, whose leadership guided us \nthrough over 300 resolutions, the adoption of the Arms \nTrade Treaty and the convening of a number of high-\nlevel thematic debates. Solomon Islands also wishes \nto acknowledge Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \nhis service and commitment to our global world. I \nwould also like to welcome Kiribati, whose permanent \nrepresentation in New York completes the Pacific small \nisland developing States (SIDS) presence in a single \ncity.\n\nMy delegation welcomes the sixty-eighth session\u2019s \ntheme, \u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: setting the \nstage\u201d. The world has changed since the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) were launched. \nPopulations have grown, cities have expanded, and \nconsumption and production patterns have pushed us \nto our planetary boundaries. Solomon Islands\u2019 MDG \nnational scorecard remains mixed. We have progressed \non some fronts and remain off track on others.\n\nThe post-2015 development agenda offers us \nan opportunity to change the way we do business. \nIn that regard, Solomon Islands seeks a new spirit \nof partnership that will reform the global economic \narchitecture. My subregion in the Pacific supplies \n60 per cent of the world\u2019s tuna. Over three decades, the \nPacific Islands have developed fisheries institutions and \nlegal and management frameworks. With international \nsupport, we can supply the world with fish. Solomon \nIslands, as Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries \nAgency and of the parties to the Nauru Agreement, \ncalls for a new mindset that would provide the Pacific \nIsland States with the space and capacity to develop its \ndomestic industries and restructure the fishing fleets of \ndistant-water nations in the region.\n\nThe Pacific Fisheries Vessel Day Scheme has \nallowed us to realize our development aspirations. Two \nnew fishing industries have established themselves this \nyear in Solomon Islands. We remain firm in our resolve \nthat the Scheme shall remain the central pillar in all our \nfisheries negotiations.\n\nSolomon Islands welcomes the President\u2019s proposal \nof convening a third thematic debate on sustainable \nenergy during this session. We note that 1.3 billion \npeople, half of whom live in least developed countries, \nhave no access to electricity. The Istanbul Programme \nof Action recognizes that access to affordable, reliable, \nrenewable energy is crucial to accelerating sustainable, \ninclusive economic growth, increased social equity and \na sustainable and clean environment.\n\nExpanding energy access for our rural populations \nand reducing energy costs are national priorities \nfor Solomon Islands. I am pleased to announce that \nSolomon Islands joined the International Renewable \nEnergy Agency (IRENA) last month. We hope to work \nwith IRENA in unlocking some of our hydroenergy \npotential. I am pleased to say that we already have a \nworking relationship with the World Bank and the Asian \nDevelopment Bank on hydro-projects. We are also in \ndiscussion with the Clinton Foundation on harvesting \nour geothermal potential. Once that gets off the ground, \nit will be a private-public sector partnership. Bilaterally \na number of partners, including the Republic of China, \nItaly and Japan, have people-centred solar programmes \nin the country. Those programmes continue to light up \nour community schools and villages. Renewable energy \nalso improves public service delivery to our rural \npopulations and empowers Solomon Islanders to make \nsustainable choices in life.\n\nGlobally, the Pacific SIDS are themselves helping \nto fill the information gaps in global renewable energy \ndatabases, in cases where information on the Pacific \nis lacking. A Pacific renewable energy database will \nbe developed in cooperation with the United Nations \nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the \nPacific. The vision is to focus on enhancing the \nPacific region\u2019s inclusion in the international energy \ndialogue and to provide sufficient data to inspire new \nglobal partners to concentrate more on on-the-ground \ninvestments, less on studies.\n\nInfrastructure development is critical in opening \nmore opportunities for our rural populations. We \nacknowledge New Zealand for the construction of \nour second international airport and other partners, \nsuch as Australia and the European Union, for the \nwharves, airfields and roads they have helped to build. \nThose structural investments allow Solomon Islands \nto enhance its trade and strengthen the unity of the \ncountry.\n\nClimate change remains a global issue that needs \na global solution. We join all small island developing \nStates and least developed countries in conveying our \nconcern about the slow progress of climate change \n\n\n\f\nnegotiations. The alarming pace of climate change is \nposing unprecedented threats to humankind\u2019s survival. \nIn May, carbon dioxide concentration reached a \nnew threshold of 400 parts per million. For Solomon \nIslands, this means that the livelihood and well-being \nof our people are now under threat. Corals stop growing \nat 500 parts per million.\n\nWe are heartened by the Secretary-General\u2019s \nproposal to convene a climate change summit next year. \nWe hope that the summit will not be a talkfest, but that it \nwill garner the necessary political will of Member States \nto increase their level of commitment to reducing and \nphasing down greenhouse-gas pollution commensurate \nwith scientific guidelines. The summit remains our best \nhope for preventing the impact of climate change from \nreaching an irreversible level. We once again register \nour regret that certain countries have reneged on their \nhistorical responsibility and unilaterally decided to opt \nout of their multilateral obligations.\n\nThe world will celebrate 2014 as the International \nYear of Small Island Developing States. The SIDS \nconference is scheduled to be held in Samoa next \nyear. We count on the world to enable small island \ndeveloping States to eradicate poverty, build resilience \nand unleash the potential of our youths. That will \nrequire the enhanced implementation of the Barbados \nProgramme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy for \nImplementation towards an evidenced-based outcome.\n\nIn seeking a sustainable future for our people, last \nyear we announced that we would establish a national \nuniversity. I am pleased to say that we launched \nSolomon Islands National University in April. A \nsecond university, the University of the South Pacific, \nhas also completed all formalities and is expected to \nbegin the construction of its fourth campus in one of \nour provinces. The development of human capital will \nallow Solomon Islands to build a knowledge-based \nsociety and have more job-ready nationals to meet our \ndevelopment needs.\n\nThis week the international community convened \nthe first inaugural meeting of the High-level Political \nForum on Sustainable Development. In preparation for \nthe Forum, the Pacific small island developing States \nformed the Pacific Islands Development Forum this \nyear. Solomon Islands is one of the founding members \nof the Forum, an alliance of States and non-State and \nprivate-sector actors that focus on the green economy \nin the context of sustainable development. The Pacific \nIslands Development Forum intends to speak with a \nunited voice in the High-level Political Forum. Pacific \nSIDS look forward to working with the Forum.\n\nI am pleased to announce that Solomon Islands \nbegan a new journey two months ago. The 10-year-old \nPacific Islands Forum Regional Assistance Mission \nto the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) \u2014 led by Australia \nand supported by New Zealand and Pacific small \nisland developing States \u2014 went through a transitional \nphase. RAMSI, provided for under Chapter VIII of \nthe Charter of the United Nations, now provides only \npolice assistance. The success of the transitional phase \nbelongs to our people and our region. On that note, I \ntake this opportunity, on behalf of the Government \nand the people of Solomon Islands, to express our \nprofound gratitude and appreciation to all our regional \nneighbours. We thank them very much.\n\nMultilateralism remains a cornerstone of Solomon \nIslands\u2019 foreign policy. Country ownership remains a \nfoundation of any cooperation and programme. This \nyear, under United Nations Development Programme \nleadership, the United Nations Development Assistance \nFramework for the Pacific (2013-2017) was launched. \nThe $292 million programme covers 14 Pacific \ncountries and territories, all with the same priorities. \nWe call on the United Nations to align itself with \nSolomon Islands national sustainable development \nstrategy 2011\u20132020. It is for that reason that over the \nyears we have called for an enhanced United Nations \ncountry presence. We renew the call to upgrade the \nUnited Nations Development Programme country \noffice from the level of deputy resident representative \nto that of resident representative.\n\nA peaceful, just and stable democracy is critical for \nsustainable development. Solomon Islands continues \nto invest in strengthening its governance system. A \npolitical party integrity bill is being introduced in \nour national Parliament. The political party bill aims \nto give more power to our electoral commission to \nproperly manage our national election process. We \nare also putting in place a sustainable, cost-effective \nand inclusive voting registration system. That is an \nexpensive exercise; we have sought partnership with \nthe United Nations, the European Union and Australia. \nWe thank our partners for their ongoing support to \nour electoral reform programme. That assistance \ncomplements work done on e-governance. Solomon \nIslands this year established a metro area network as \na single secure network connecting 85 Government \n\n\n\f\noffices. We hope that will improve the efficiency and \neffectiveness of the Government\u2019s computer machinery.\n\nSolomon Islands would like to see a strong United \nNations. We are encouraged by the Assembly\u2019s \ncommitment to achieving real progress on reforming \nand revitalizing two of our principal organs, the \nSecurity Council and the General Assembly. We assure \nthe Assembly of our support on those two endeavours.\n\nMy delegation also welcomes the modernization of \nthe Secretariat Building and the conference rooms and \nthe renovation of the General Assembly. We are also \npleased to note that United Nations competitive exams \nwill be held in my capital in the next two months. We \nare holding the exams for the third consecutive year. \nI thank the Secretariat, and in particular the United \nNations human resources personnel, for their outreach, \nand sincerely hope the nationals selected will contribute \nto the diversity of the Secretariat.\n\nChanging global realities have seen the emergence \nand expansion of South-South cooperation. This year, \nSolomon Islands established two new diplomatic \nmissions in Cuba and Malaysia, respectively. On \n18 April, Solomon Islands raised its flag in Havana. We \nalso welcomed Cuba as a Pacific Islands Forum post-\nforum dialogue partner three weeks ago. Similarly, in \nMalaysia last month the first resident Solomon Islands \nAmbassador presented his credentials. We intend to \nstrengthen our ties with the wider Asian and Pacific \nregion, including the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations and India. We have some 100 medical students \nin Cuba; the first graduates are expected in 2014. We \nthank Cuba for its cooperation.\n\nFor more than two decades, the General Assembly \nhas called overwhelmingly for the lifting of the more \nthan five-decades-old economic blockade imposed on \nCuba by our friend and partner the United States of \nAmerica. Confrontational lines will need to be replaced \nwith dialogue and cooperation. We cannot look to the \nfuture if we cling to the past. We hope that a forward-\nlooking policy will be embraced by the United States of \nAmerica in easing the blockade.\n\nI turn now to bilateral cooperation with Papua New \nGuinea, my Melanesian neighbour. Papua New Guinea \ncontinues to provide opportunities for young Solomon \nIslanders in terms of employment and scholarships. \nVisa-free work schemes have been launched, and trade \nrelations continue to grow to new heights.\n\nIn my subregion, the Melanesian Spearhead \nGroup \u2014 composed of Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu \nand Solomon Islands \u2014 represents one of the most \ndiverse regions of the world. A quarter of the world\u2019s \nlanguages are spoken by the more than 8 million people \nof the subregion. Enhanced free trade has unified the \nculturally rich diverse populations. Today, the Group \nis exploring other economic, security and political \ncooperation.\n\nOn Fiji, Solomon Islands welcomes the progress \nput in place by the Government of Fiji for the people \nto freely express themselves through the parliamentary \nelections scheduled for 2014. Solomon Islands notes \nthe adoption of Fiji\u2019s new Constitution and wishes \nthe Government and people of Fiji every success in \ndetermining their own future.\n\nThe inalienable right to self-determination is a \nkey pillar of the United Nations. With respect to New \nCaledonia, members of the Melanesian Spearhead Group \ncontinue to support the Territory\u2019s self-determination \nprocess in accordance with the Charter of the United \nNations, the relevant human rights instruments and the \nNoumea Accord. In regard to the Territory of French \nPolynesia, I take this opportunity to thank the General \nAssembly and all Pacific small island developing States \nfor adopting by consensus resolution 67/265, on the \nself-determination of French Polynesia in May. The \nquestions of the Territories of French Polynesia and \nNew Caledonia are scheduled to be discussed by the \nFourth Committee next week.\n\nOn human rights, Solomon Islands recognizes \nthat all States bear the responsibility to protect their \ncitizens. We believe that all States must take feasible \nsteps to ensure that the rights of their people are \nprotected. Solomon Islands, in that regard, condemns \nall human rights violations against civilians, wherever \nthey may occur.\n\nOn the Middle East, we continue to watch with horror \nthe daily carnage and the humanitarian catastrophe in \nSyria. We note with concern the preliminary findings \nof the United Nations investigation team confirming the \nuse of chemical weapons. Solomon Islands welcomes \nthe Russian and United States initiatives to destroy \nchemical weapons in Syria, and further supports all \nefforts to find a diplomatic and political solution to the \ncivil war.\n\n\n\f\nOn Israel and Palestine, we support all international \nefforts for the two States to resume negotiations and \nachieve a just, lasting and sustainable peace.\n\nSolomon Islands remains an arms-free State. We \nnote that the use of conventional and unconventional \narms in the wrong hands threatens international peace \nand stability. Solomon Islands welcomes the recently \nadopted Arms Trade Treaty and hopes that major \nplayers in the arms trade will sign that international \nframework. That will strengthen the Treaty. Solomon \nIslands continues to follow and assess the Treaty\u2019s \nprogress.\n\nOn the question of the Republic of China, Solomon \nIslands call for the Republic\u2019s meaningful participation \nat United Nations specialized organizations. We would \nlike to acknowledge the Republic of China\u2019s recent \nparticipation in the Assembly of the International \nCivil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as a guest of the \norganization\u2019s President. We recognize that as a first \nstep. We continue to seek observer status for the \nRepublic of China both at ICAO and at the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \nThose requests mirror the observer status that the \nRepublic of China currently enjoys at the World Health \nAssembly.\n\nSolomon Islands continues to serve on the United \nNations Executive Board. We welcome the new \nExecutive Director of UN-Women, Ms. Phumzile \nMlambo-Ngcuka, and assure her of our cooperation. \nWe note with concern that the UN-Women strategic \nplan for 2014-2017 is underfunded. We call for political \nand financial support for the plan. We support the \nExecutive Director\u2019s call that priority be given to the \neconomic empowerment of women in rural areas. \nWe hope the Executive Board can also address UN-\nWomen\u2019s representation vacuum in the Pacific. \n\nGender violence remains an issue in Solomon \nIslands, and my country joins the international \ncommunity in condemning sexual violence.\n\nWe continue to seek an inclusive society. In \npartnership with an Australian entity, Solomon Islands \norganized national games for persons with disabilities \nin our country and other events. Although we still \nhave a long way to go in creating a disability-friendly \nsociety, we remain determined to achieve that end.\n\nLet me close where I began. The post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda is our shared agenda. We must \nremain united and work as one, with one aim, to deliver \none set of goals, under a single process with common \nbut differentiated responsibilities. Present and future \ngenerations depend on what we do today.\n"

        "file_text": "At \nthe beginning of this week, at the opening of the \ngeneral debate, the international community strongly \ncondemned the heinous attacks that have once again \nstruck Kenya. That situation should lead us to reflect \non our ability to prevent, manage and settle conflicts. \nKenya\u2019s tragedy is to be situated near the territory of \nSomalia, which for too long has been left to terrorist \ngroups. The lesson is to avoid the creation of any \nvacuum that could serve as fertile ground for subversive \nmovements. That is why in Central Africa the member \nStates of the subregional community have reacted \nquickly to the risk of the \u201cSomalization\u201d of the Central \nAfrican Republic ever since the beginning of the crisis \nthere, despite our limited resources.\n\nThe dialogue on the humanitarian crisis in the \nCentral African Republic that we, the partners of \nthat ravaged country, held recently in New York, on \n25 September, clearly indicated that the international \ncommunity has taken stock of the challenge and \nhas decided to resolutely provide assistance to the \nCentral African Republic on the political, security, \nhumanitarian, economic and financial levels, and to \nensure that it has a successful transition, like that of \nMali, a country which we commend and which deserves \nall our attention and solidarity today as it did yesterday.\n\nTherefore, beyond the humanitarian emergency, \nthe Central African Republic must be given all the \nresources necessary to restore the authority of the \nState, enable its Administration to operate, revive the \neconomy and prepare for elections. An international \nsupport mission in the Central African Republic \nis being established under African leadership. We \nencourage the Security Council to swiftly adopt a \nresolution supporting that initiative, which is aimed at \ncreating the necessary conditions to restore peace and \nsecurity, which would ensure the much-needed stability \nand the effective implementation of the transition \nroad map. As a mediator and as chair of the follow-\nup committee of the Economic Community of Central \nAfrican States on the situation in the Central African \nRepublic monitoring that crisis, the Congo can only \nwelcome that very encouraging development.\n\n\n\f\nAlso in the context of my country\u2019s neighbourhood, \nby participating in the signing of the Peace, Security \nand Cooperation Framework for the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo and the Region, which took \nplace on 24 February, President Denis Sassou Nguesso \nreaffirmed his commitment to a foreign policy aimed at \npeace and security in the world in general and in Africa, \nparticularly in Central Africa and the Great Lakes \nRegion. In doing so, he favoured the quest for peaceful \nsolutions and showed his willingness to continue along \nthat path. The various consultations he has initiated in \nthe context of the implementation of the Framework \nagreement and the appeals directed to him demonstrate \nhis approach.\n\nIn that spirit, the Congo is pleased with the \nconclusions of the Second Meeting of States Parties \nto the Framework Agreement, which was held in New \nYork on 23 September. We commend the leadership of \nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, while we call \nfor those efforts to culminate in talks in Kampala.\n\nJust two years ago, we welcomed the wave of \npopular uprisings \u2014 the so-called Arab Spring, which \nled to the fall of some political regimes in the Arab \nworld, sometimes by force of arms. We welcomed \nthose movements, just as we welcomed the enormous \nchanges that transformed the European landscape after \nthe fall of the Berlin wall, in 1989. Today, in view of \nthe developments in some of those countries, whose \npopulations aspired and still legitimately aspire to \nfreedom, democracy and social justice, I cannot fail \nto recall the remarks that I made from this rostrum \nduring the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly \n(see A/66/PV.27). I called then for greater caution and \nprudence, convinced that the overthrow of a political \nregime does not necessarily bring freedom and \ndemocracy, since they must be won and nurtured by \nother victories that cannot be imposed from the outside.\n\nThe situations we have just mentioned are replete \nwith lessons, not just because of the internal instability \nthat may result from them, but also and above all because \nof their unpredictable negative impact on regional and \ninternational peace and security.\n\nIt that regard, I shall mention other challenges to \ninternational peace and security, particularly those \nof the Syrian tragedy, which is unfolding relentlessly \nbefore our eyes, and the untenable Israeli-Palestinian \nconflict, which has consumed so many human lives and \nso much energy and time.\n\nWith regard to the situation in Syria, my delegation \nstrongly condemns the use of chemical weapons and \nwelcomes the Syrian Government\u2019s adherence to \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention and its decision \nto place its stockpile of chemical weapons under \ninternational control for destruction. Nevertheless, we \nbelieve that only a political solution can put an end to \nthe martyrdom of the Syrian people and the fratricidal \nwar that has already killed more than 100,000 people. \nThat is why the Congo welcomes the United States-\nRussian agreement and the discussions under way in \nthe Security Council on the adoption of a resolution \nthat would mark the first steps in a process that will, \nwe hope, in the near future, bring together the Syrian \nactors and all parties involved around a table in the \nframework of a conference for peace in Syria. In that \nregard, once again, we believe that the focus must be \nplaced on finding a peaceful solution.\n\nAt the same time as Syria is agreeing to \neliminate its stockpile of chemical weapons, it is \nappropriate to recall one of the most serious threats to \nhumankind \u2014 the nuclear danger. It is indeed urgent \nfor the nuclear-weapon States, as well as for those that \nhave other weapons of mass destruction, including \nbiological weapons, to implement concrete measures \nenabling the elimination of those arsenals and making \nprogress towards real disarmament, while ensuring \nrespect for the prohibition of nuclear proliferation for \nmilitary purposes. This is also the moment to commend \nthe overtures made here by Iran concerning its nuclear \nprogramme.\n\nLast year, the Congo supported the General \nAssembly\u2019s historic decision to confer United Nations \nnon-Member observer State status on Palestine. It was \na symbolic act that the Assembly welcomed almost \nunanimously. The new American initiative designed \nto relaunch the Israeli-Palestinian talks also deserves \nthe support of the entire international community. Here \ntoo, the Congo encourages dialogue and rejects any \nrecourse to force or violence.\n\nGiven the current series of political crises and in \nthe spirit of peace and justice, how can we fail to ask \nthat the embargo unjustly imposed on the Cuban people \nfor five decades be lifted? That unilateral decision is \ncontrary to the principles and values of the Charter of \nthe United Nations and to international order, based \non non-interference in a State\u2019s internal affairs and \npeaceful cooperation.\n\n\n\f\nThe damage done by the economic and financial \ncrisis that recently shook the world is far from being \nrepaired; even if here and there we can see some signs \nof recovery, they are unfortunately not capable of \nrelaunching sustained growth. The progress that about \n40 developing countries have made has definitely led to \nsome rebalancing of power, as the Human Development \nReport 2013 of the United Nations Development \nProgramme indicates. However, the fruits of that growth \nare unequally distributed. Similarly, the disparities both \nwithin countries and between rich and poor countries \nonce again raises the problem of inequality and social \njustice, which often causes social unrest. Between now \nand 2015 there will be numerous African countries \nthat will not meet the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs).\n\nFor my own country, there has been significant \nprogress in achieving the MDGs, especially those \nrelating to education and maternal and child health, \nthanks to my Government\u2019s efforts and initiatives in \nareas such as abolishing school fees, providing free \ntextbooks, recruiting teachers and providing free \nCaesarean sections, vaccinations and antiretroviral \ntreatments. However, progress has been somewhat \nslow in fighting poverty and promoting decent jobs. \nNonetheless, combating poverty remains a major \nconcern to which my Government accords high priority \nthrough investment programmes in health, education, \nprofessional training, infrastructure, agricultural \nproduction, forestry and mining.\n\nWe have reasons to hope for progress between \nnow and 2015. The national context is being prepared. \nThe Republic of the Congo enjoys reassuring stability \nand a favourable economic environment. Lasting \npeace has been established. We are consolidating the \ndemocratic process, which is strengthened by a regular \ndialogue between the Government and the opposition \non organizing peaceful elections. My country has also \nbuilt a harmonious overall framework for implementing \nits development policy, focused on modernizing and \nindustrializing the country on the basis of our national \ndevelopment plan for 2012-2016.\n\nThe favourable rise in the price of petroleum \nproducts and other natural resources such as wood has \nenabled my country to register significant increases \nin its economic growth rate, now over 5 per cent per \nyear since 2010, allowing for inflation. That economic \nimprovement has notably benefited State revenues, \nwhich have been going up steadily. The Republic of the \nCongo has also benefited from substantial debt relief \nafter reaching the completion point for the Heavily \nIndebted Poor Countries Initiative in January 2010 and \nwill from now on have more resources available for \nnational development programmes, particularly in the \nsocial sectors.\n\nStructural reforms undertaken through the Extended \nCredit Facility of the International Monetary Fund have \nenabled us to make essential progress in managing the \npublic finances and macroeconomic stabilization. The \nbusiness climate continues to improve. Other measures \nhave been taken to enable the Congo to speed up its \nachievement of the MDGs between now and 2015.\n\nThe 2012 United Nations Conference on \nSustainable Development (Rio+20) outlined for us \n\u201cThe future we want\u201d. Ambassador Ashe, who was one \nof the co-facilitators of the Rio+20 process and is now \nthe President of the General Assembly, is therefore well \nplaced to help us to set the stage that will enable us \nto reach the horizon that is the future we want. \u201cThe \npost-2015 development agenda: setting the stage\u201d is the \ntheme of the current session. It invites us to establish the \nfoundations for another vision of development, focused \non poverty eradication and human development. \nMy delegation agrees with the President that what is \nneeded is an ambitious, bold programme that takes new \nand emerging development challenges into account \nand that better integrates the economic, social and \nenvironmental aspects of sustainable development.\n\nThe Congo, a country in the forested Congo \nbasin, can only concur with that view. The Congo\u2019s \ncommitment to sustainable development at the national \nlevel, as well as at the regional and international \nlevels, has been unflagging. It is in that context that, \nafter having spoken for Africa throughout the Rio+20 \nprocess, the Congo has continued its active commitment \nwithin the framework of the Open Working Group on \nSustainable Development Goals. Once those sustainable \ndevelopment goals have been defined, there remains the \nvital issue of how to finance sustainable development, \nwhich will be tackled by establishing a committee of \nexperts on the issue.\n\nIt is regrettable that the issue of climate change, \nwhich affects all humankind, is still suffering from a \nlack of consensus. Permit me to revisit a subject of deep \nconcern for developing countries such as ours, namely, \nthe issue of financing the fight against climate change, \nwhich should be a central element in our negotiations. \nFor our part, we affirm the importance of supporting \n\n\n\f\ndeveloping countries in establishing low-carbon \nregimes that can adapt to climate change in order to \ntackle the worldwide problem that humankind is facing.\n\nIn regard to the programme entitled \u201cReducing \nDeforestation and Forest Degradation and Enhancing \nEnvironmental Services in Tropical Forests\u201d, \nestablished by the International Tropical Timber \nCouncil, the Congo welcomes the consensus on the \nimportance of participation by all countries, according \nto their capacity and national context, in the fight \nagainst deforestation, forest degradation and of \nincreasing stocks of forest carbon, which is responsible \nfor almost 20 per cent of total greenhouse-gas \nemissions. Our interest in conserving nature and \nprotecting wildlife has impelled us to launch a fierce \nfight against poaching. In that context, next year the \nCongo is organizing a major international meeting \non combating that scourge. Participants will include \npolitical and technical stakeholders involved in wildlife \nmanagement, countries that buy wildlife products, and \ninternational organizations.\n\nThe world has changed, and we must deal with the \nnew geopolitical challenges that have helped new forces \nto emerge onto the international scene. Every living \norganism must evolve. The United Nations, which we \nwould like to see become more transparent, dynamic \nand democratic, cannot avoid that law of nature.\n\nAs President John F. Kennedy noted as early as in \n1963, at the eighteenth session of the General Assembly,\n\n\u201cThe United Nations cannot survive as a static \nOrganization. Its obligations are increasing as well \nas its size. Its Charter must be changed as well as its \ncustoms. The authors of that Charter did not intend \nthat it be frozen in perpetuity.\u201d (A/PV.1209, p. 7)\nWe are therefore at the heart of an important and timely \ndebate.\nUnited Nations reform is therefore urgent \nand possible. It must be based on the principles of \ndemocracy, justice and equality. In that regard, the cycle \nof the intergovernmental negotiations on the question \nof equitable representation on and increase in the \nmembership of the Security Council and other matters \nrelated to the Council should lead, through a consensual \nframework, to concrete results. That reform is part of \nthe will of the Member States to make the Organization \nan institution that expresses the values of modernity \nand is open to the future, a sanctuary for builders of the \nfuture of the world, a world where planetary challenges \nrequire concerted global solutions, a world that is being \nbuilt on the bedrock of solidarity, unity, mutual respect \nand tolerance.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour to \naddress the General Assembly for the first time in my \ncapacity as President of the Republic of Cyprus.\n\nWhile it is realistic and pragmatic to acknowledge \nthat in an anarchic international system the political \nand economic leverage and might of States, or even \nof international organizations, are asymmetric \nand unequal, one should never forget the founding \nprinciples of the Charter of the Organization, which \nwere formulated as a result of the traumatic historic \nexperiences of two world wars. \n\nBearing in mind the aim of promoting the \nfundamental United Nations principles, I would like to \nshare my deep concern regarding what is happening in \nvarious parts of the world, threatening the sovereignty of \nStates and regional and global stability through, among \nother things, acts of State violence, acts of terrorism, \nthe infringement and calling into question of sovereign \nrights enjoyed by States, the annexation of territories \nthrough the illegal use of force, the production and \nuse of weapons of mass destruction, the sponsoring \nand harbouring of secessionist or terrorist movements, \nreligious fundamentalism manifested through terrorist \nattacks, the forcible displacement of millions of people, \nand hunger and distress, which intensify migration \nflows and create demographic changes.\n\nThese are but a few examples that bear out the \nneed to evaluate, through collective debate and self-\nassessment, whether the United Nations principles, \nvalues and methods have indeed contributed to what we \nhave all been hoping for \u2014 the maintenance of peace \nand security and respect for the fundamental freedoms \nand human rights of all people.\n\nI am not a romantic ideologist; quite the contrary, \nI am a pragmatic realist who acknowledges that in this \nimperfect world it is extremely difficult, even impossible, \nto expect the full and unquestioning implementation of \nUnited Nations principles and values. However, what \nis happening today risks overthrowing the current \n\n\n\f\nworld order, calling into question the relevance and \neffectiveness of this international Organization.\n\n\n\nIt is not my intention to cast doubt on or minimize \nthe multidimensional contribution of the United Nations \nto a plethora of cases over the past seven decades. What \nis important is to enhance the Organization\u2019s role and \nsafeguard the effectiveness of its decisions, as well \nas its actions. Should decisions or resolutions based \non international law condemning violations of human \nrights not be implemented or enforced, that could be \nseen as fostering or even rewarding arbitrariness. In \nthat case, regional differences and conflicts could be \nprolonged indefinitely, serving the petty interests and \nexpedience of their perpetrators at the expense of \ninternational law and our universal principles.\n\nI do not intend to enter into detail of what we are \nwitnessing and experiencing every day in different \nparts of the world. I will limit myself to the example \nof my own country, a small European country that has \nfor almost 40 years been violently divided, despite \nnumerous Security Council resolutions calling for its \nreunification and the withdrawal of the occupation \nforces.\n\nI take this opportunity to assure the General \nAssembly that, despite the current economic difficulties \nwe are facing, I am committed to working tirelessly \nand with determination to reach a viable and lasting \nsettlement so that all the communities of Cyprus may \nlive and thrive in a modern European country that fully \nrespects the values and principles of the United Nations \nand the European Union, safeguards the fundamental \nfreedoms and human rights of all its people, and \nensures their peaceful coexistence and prosperous \ncollaboration.\n\nAs I have already conveyed to the Secretary-\nGeneral, it is my firm belief that the current status quo \nis unacceptable and that its prolongation would have \nfurther negative consequences for Greek and Turkish \nCypriots. Therefore, a comprehensive settlement is not \nonly desirable, but should not be further delayed. In \nthat respect, I wish, as a leader with a sincere vision \nof reuniting my country, to once more call on Turkey \nand our Cypriot compatriots to demonstrate the same \ndetermination and commitment and become partners in \nthe effort for the reunification of a peaceful, secure and \nprosperous homeland.\n\nThe reference made by the President of the Republic \nof Turkey, Mr. Abdullah G\u00fcl, in this very Hall (see \nA/68/PV.5) to the 2004 proposal that, through genuine \ndemocratic procedures, was not accepted by the vast \nmajority of Greek Cypriots for a number of substantive \nreasons, does not absolve Turkey from its obligations \nand responsibilities concerning the efforts to find a just \nsolution and does not truly reflect the realities on the \nground, as borne out by the relevant United Nations \nresolutions.\n\nNonetheless, I welcome the decision of Turkey to \nrespond positively to my proposal to hold meetings with \nthe negotiator of the Greek Cypriot community. I hope, \nand at the same time expect, that this positive response \nwill be followed by practical and substantial steps and \nthe adoption of a constructive attitude, guided by good \nfaith, that will contribute effectively towards reaching \na settlement.\n\nIn that respect, it is my strong belief that it is of \nparamount significance that a dynamic impetus be \nlaunched, either before or even during the negotiating \nprocess, in order to restore the confidence of the people \nof Cyprus in the prospect of reaching a settlement. Such \nan impetus can be achieved only through the adoption \nof bold measures that are seen as game-changers and \nas creating a win-win situation, not only for both \ncommunities but also for all interested stakeholders.\n\nWith that in mind, I have submitted a package \nproposal that, among other things, includes the return \nof the ghost city of Famagusta to its lawful inhabitants, \nunder the auspices of the United Nations and in line \nwith Security Council resolution 550 (1984). The return \nof Famagusta, along with the evident advantage of \nreviving the hope of the people of Cyprus, will also \nprovide a number of benefits. The infrastructural \nrestoration of a city that has been uninhabited for 39 \nyears will undoubtedly lead to the creation of new jobs \nin a wide variety of professional fields, providing a \nmajor boost to the economy of the country. At the same \ntime, by working together, building mutual trust and \nenjoying the results of joint collaboration, Greek and \nTurkish Cypriots will come closer to the realization of \nthe benefits of sharing together a prosperous future, \njust as we have done in the past.\n\nI believe that the Assembly shares my assessment \nthat this proposal, which is complementary to \nthe negotiating process, is to the benefit of both \ncommunities and that its acceptance would provide a \nmuch-needed stimulus to the prospect of reaching a \n\n\n\f\nsettlement. At the same time, in order to avoid entering \ninto a new frustrating negotiating process, the time for \nthe start of the negotiations is not as important as that \nthey be conducted in a comprehensive manner with \nclear substance, aims and targets. \n\nTo that end, I consider it essential that, before the \nstart of the negotiating process, it be clearly established \nthat the basis and solution to be reached will adhere \nto the relevant United Nations resolutions, the high-\nlevel agreements and the evolving transformation of \nthe Republic of Cyprus into a bi-zonal, bi-communal \nfederal State with a single international personality, \nsingle sovereignty and single citizenship. Moreover, \nthe settlement must embody our capacity as a European \nUnion (EU) member State and fully enshrine its \nvalues and principles by enhancing the role of the EU \nin the negotiating process. I have to clarify that such \na role played by the European Union would merely \nsupplement and complement the United Nations good \noffices mission in order to guarantee not only our \neffective and efficient participation in the European \nUnion, through the proper implementation of the \nacquis communautaire, but also the restoration of the \nfundamental freedoms and human rights of all Cypriots.\n\nLast but not least, an important humanitarian \naspect of the Cyprus problem is the issue of missing \npersons. We salute the progress achieved so far. The \nissue must be resolved as soon as possible, regardless \nof the developments in the negotiations.\n\nThe positive and stabilizing role that Cyprus can \nassume in the eastern Mediterranean \u2014 especially \nin the areas of combatting terrorism, fighting the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \nproviding humanitarian assistance \u2014has in the past \nfew months received extensive recognition. Keeping \nCyprus peaceful and stable and maintaining its \nconstructive regional role is a primary objective of my \nGovernment. We have proven that we are a reliable \nand interconnecting bridge between Europe, North \nAfrica and the Near and Middle Easts \u2014 in terms of \nboth perception and actions \u2014 as well as a credible \nand stable country that gives true credence to being \na safe haven. That has been demonstrated in practice \nseveral times during periods of massive humanitarian \nevacuations. We stand ready once more, if it is deemed \nnecessary \u2014 and hopefully it will not be \u2014 to contribute \nin a substantive manner to any international call to \nprovide humanitarian aid and facilities to the nationals \nof any third country.\n\nA recent and most encouraging development in our \narea is taking place in the field of energy cooperation. \nThe very promising potential of hydrocarbon \nexploration in the Levantine basin requires that all \ncountries in the region work closely together, bilaterally \nand regionally. Pertinent to that and a testament to our \nconstructive role in the region is the fact that Cyprus \nhas assumed a leading role in bringing neighbouring \nhydrocarbon-producing countries together, seeking \nopportunities not only for maritime boundary \nagreements, but also for joint efforts in exploring those \nhydrocarbon resources. Energy, in my opinion, should \nbe not a source of conflict, but a catalyst for conflict \nresolution and regional integration.\n\nThe Millennium Development Goals framework \nhas galvanized unparalleled development efforts and \nguided global and national development priorities since \n2000. While three of the eight Goals have been achieved \nprior to the final deadline, much work remains to be \ndone ahead of 2015. With only two years left, enhanced \ncommitment, resources and efforts are needed, as is a \ncoordinated and integrated approach that can contribute \nto accelerating progress towards the achievement of all \nthe Millennium Goals.\n\nAs a small island State facing particular challenges, \nwe understand well why the coherence of all processes \nleading to a single and universal post-2015 development \nagenda is crucial. New and emerging asymmetric \nchallenges \u2014 such as climate change and natural \ndisasters, terrorism, inequalities and the necessity for \nthe prevalence of the rule of law, democracy and human \nrights \u2014 require renewed and collective commitment \nand an effective target-oriented post-2015 framework \nwith poverty eradication and sustainable development \nat its heart.\n\nAs the Secretary-General says in his report entitled \n\u201cA life of dignity for all: accelerating progress towards \nthe Millennium Development Goals and advancing the \nUnited Nations development agenda beyond 2015\u201d, \n\n\u201cthe world\u2019s quest for dignity, peace, prosperity, \njustice, sustainability and an end to poverty has \nreached an unprecedented moment of urgency\u201d \n(A/68/202, para. 1) \u201cand the world\u2019s nations must \nunite behind a common programme to act on those \naspirations\u201d (ibid., para. 120).\nCyprus strongly subscribes to the joint efforts in \nfulfilling this task.\n\f\nA few months ago, my country received \nunprecedented international attention because of \nthe economic crisis. I am proud to say that, due to \nthe persistence, determination and resilience of the \npeople of Cyprus, we are rising to the challenge and \nwill soon lead our country to the path of recovery and \ngrowth. My political vision is for Cyprus to receive \ninternational attention yet again, but this time for all \nthe right reasons.\n\nThis points to an end in the long-standing \nanachronistic division of my country, in line with \nthe aspirations of our people, especially the younger \ngenerations, to coexist peacefully in a European \ncountry that fully respects their fundamental human \nrights and freedoms. I am certain that all will agree \nthat the reunification is in the interests not only of the \npeople of Cyprus, but also of the entire international \ncommunity, since a solution to the Cyprus problem \nwill undoubtedly have a very important spillover effect \non efforts to achieve a much-needed environment of \nstability, security and peace in our region.\n\nFor our part, we are determined to rise to the \nchallenge of this historic responsibility and do our \nutmost with the aim of providing a more stable, \nprosperous and conciliatory future in our immediate \nregion, so that our legacy is remembered by generations \nto come.\n"

        "file_text": "I thank the President for \nraising for discussion at this year\u2019s general debate \na very pertinent subject, namely, \u201cThe post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage\u201d. Shaping our \nplanet\u2019s future after 2015 is indeed a crucial task ahead \nof us, as Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon described \nvery impressively in his presentation this morning (see \nA/68/PV.5). While we remain fully committed to the \nfull implementation of the Millennium Development \nGoals, the post-2015 agenda has started.\n\nOne idea that has caught my particular attention is \nto upgrade the eradication of hunger from an indictor \nto a goal in that new agenda. More still needs to be \ndone, and everyone must contribute a fair share: States, \ninternational organizations, the private sector, academia \nand civil society alike. Let me assure the Assembly that \nAustria will contribute its share as well.\n\nThe international community currently faces major \nthreats in its search for global security. The Middle \nEast remains exposed to fundamental challenges. We \nwelcome the agreement reached between the United \nStates and the Russian Federation on a framework for \nthe destruction of the Syrian chemical weapons arsenal. \nWe believe that the Security Council should refer the \nsituation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. \nAccountability is, and remains, necessary to stopping \nthe atrocities and prevent future crimes.\n\nThe path to democratic participation and a new \nbeginning in Syria \u2014 the actual goal of the civilian \nprotests that started two and a half years ago \u2014 remains \ncrucial. Unfortunately, the parties seem to be firmly \nset on a military solution to the conflict. However, it \nshould be clear that the best way to achieve a sustainable \nsolution can only be a political, negotiated one. That is \nthe Austrian position.\n\nBy now the civil war in Syria is greatly affecting all \nneighbouring countries. The conflict is a Syrian one, \nbut the consequences go far beyond its borders. It has \nindeed become international.\n\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict seems to have \nbeen overshadowed by the upheavals in the region. I \nhave followed events there for almost 40 years. I am \nconvinced that what is needed for a solution is the \nwillingness not only to negotiate in good faith but also \nto take into account the needs and sensibilities of the \nnegotiating partner: the other side. I, for one, cannot \nbelieve that the value of the new settlements to Israel \noutweighs the damage they cause by being an obstacle \nto peace and reasonable conditions.\n\nWe welcome that the new United States \nAdministration has devoted its full attention to that \nlong-standing question and that direct negotiations \nresumed at the end of July. What we need now is decisive \nleadership. We are convinced that a breakthrough in \nthe central conflict would also mean a decisive step \ntowards stabilization of the entire region.\n\nWhile we continue to support the ongoing transition \nprocesses in the Arab world, recent developments \nin the region have cast a shadow on the democratic \ngains achieved so far. Progress on the difficult path to \ndemocracy will greatly depend upon whether all parts \nof society are included.\n\nVienna and its United Nations headquarters \nserve as a platform for the discussion on sustainable \ndevelopment. Austria is very pleased that the Office of \nthe Special Representative for the Sustainable Energy \nfor All initiative in Vienna started its activities on \n1 July. We welcome the initiative\u2019s cooperation with \nthematic and regional hubs, as well as with other \nspecialized organizations like the United Nations \nIndustrial Development Organization.\n\n\n\f\nAustria is also the host country of the newly \nestablished International Anti-Corruption Academy. \nThis international organization and centre of excellence \nhas already undertaken several successful activities in \nfighting corruption \u2014 a major obstacle to reasonable \ndevelopment in all areas of society. I thank the Kingdom \nof Thailand for hosting the second Assembly of Parties, \nscheduled to take place in December. Furthermore, I \nwould like to invite all States that have not yet done so \nto become members of the Anti-Corruption Academy.\n\nThis year\u2019s Forum of the United Nations Alliance \nof Civilizations took place in Vienna in February, with \nthe forward-looking theme of \u201cResponsible leadership \nin diversity and dialogue\u201d. More than 1,500 participants \nfrom Government, civil society, the private sector and \nthe media, as well as a youth forum of 150 outstanding \nand highly dedicated participants, provided most \nvaluable input for the discussions of the Forum.\n\nIn that context, I am also pleased to report that the \nKing Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz International Centre \nfor Interreligious and Intercultural Dialogue was \ninaugurated in Vienna on 26 November 2012. The \nCentre \u2014 a joint initiative of the Kingdom of Saudi \nArabia, the Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of \nAustria \u2014 serves as an interactive platform for religious \nleaders, experts and civil society alike.\n\nMultilateral cooperation can deliver solutions \nto global problems. The historic accomplishment of \nthe Arms Trade Treaty is an important example in \nthat regard. We look forward to its earliest possible \nentry into force. At the same time, the international \ndisarmament and non-proliferation regime is being \nchallenged, day after day, by alarming developments. \nWe were, and still are, deeply shocked by the use of \nchemical weapons in Syria. We observe North Korea\u2019s \ncontinued development of nuclear weapons and missile \ncapabilities with concern. And we have new hope \nthat the Iranian nuclear issue will be resolved by \nnegotiations, which, after the election of a new Iranian \nPresident, should be resumed shortly.\n\nSimilarly, the continued reliance on nuclear weapons \nand the limited progress towards nuclear disarmament \nare of great global concern. Nuclear disarmament and \nnon-proliferation efforts can be achieved only when \nthey go forward together. Nuclear weapons should be \nstigmatized, banned and eliminated. The humanitarian \nconsequences of nuclear weapons have to be put at the \ncentre of our attention.\n\nWhile some might believe that there is a \ncontradiction between respect for cultural and religious \ndifferences on the one hand and the universality of \nhuman rights on the other, I am convinced that they \nreinforce each other. If people and nations can count on \nhuman rights being protected, they will show respect \nfor the other side.\n\nThe Human Rights Council, with its universal \nperiodic review mechanism and special procedures, \nhas, within a few years, developed into an effective \ninstrument to address human rights violations and \ncrisis situations in many instances. Austria, as a current \nmember of the Council, is contributing to those efforts \nwith targeted initiatives for the safety of journalists, the \nprotection of religious minorities and the promotion of \nthe rights of the child. \n\nWe welcome the continuing trend towards the \nuniversal abolition of the death penalty, which is a \nlongstanding interest of mine. However, too many \ncountries still maintain a retentionist policy with regard \nto that cruel and inhuman form of punishment. Our \ndiplomatic efforts therefore have to be reinforced.\n\nWe are worried by the increasing number of \nhuman rights violations based on sexual orientation or \ngender identity. The 1993 World Conference on Human \nRights in Vienna and the 2005 World Summit firmly \nplaced human rights at the centre of United Nations \nactivities. Respect for human rights is an indispensable \nprerequisite for peace, security and development.\n\nLast year, the High-level Meeting of the General \nAssembly on the Rule of Law provided an excellent \nopportunity for us to renew our commitment to the \nrule of law at the national and international levels. \nThe Austrian Government is considering setting up an \nAustrian rule-of-law trust fund, designed to support \ninternational actors in strengthening the rule of law \nand to offer legal expertise and deploy legal experts \nfree of charge to developing countries, at their request. \nInternational law and the rule of law are the foundations \nof the international system. Austria strongly believes \nthat only an international system based on the rule \nof law can lead to lasting peace, security, economic \ndevelopment and social progress. Obviously, that is \nparticularly true for the use of force, which should \noccur only in self-defence or when authorized by the \nSecurity Council.\n\nIn that spirit, let me confirm that Austria remains \nfully committed to an effective United Nations system. \n\nIn that connection, I especially want to thank Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts and his \ncommitment to peace, the rule of law and human rights.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, \nit is an honour for me to address the plenary of this \nOrganization, a symbol of universal values and of the \nbest causes of humankind. \n\nOn behalf of the people and Government of Mexico, \nI thank the international community for the generous \nexpressions of solidarity and support following the \nweather-related events in my country. They contribute \nto the work of the Government and to the fraternal \nparticipation of civil society in providing assistance to \nthose affected. \n\nOver the past two weeks, Mexico has suffered the \nunprecedented simultaneous arrival of two hurricanes, \nIngrid and Manuel, one on the Pacific coast and the \nother on the Atlantic coast. Over the past few decades, \nMexico has worked hard to bolster its capability to \n\n\n\f\nprevent and respond to natural disasters. However, \nthe increased vulnerability we face in the world \nunderscores the need and urgency for action. That is \nwhy we welcome the Secretary-General\u2019s decision to \nconvene a summit in September 2014 to address the \nimpact of climate change. Mexico will participate \nenthusiastically and will continue to contribute to the \nimplementation of the agreements reached in 2010 at \nCanc\u00fan. \n\nI join in the international community\u2019s unanimous \ncondemnation of the unspeakable attacks against \ncivilians in Nairobi. Mexico expresses its solidarity \nto the Government and people of Kenya, as well as \nour condolences to relatives of the victims. Such \nunfortunate acts constitute an affront to peace and \nclearly demonstrate the need for us to remain vigilant \nin the fight against terrorism. We also join those who \nhave expressed their condolences to the Government \nand people of Pakistan following the recent earthquake.\n\nMy countrty believes in multilateralism and \nreiterates its unflinching commitment to the \nOrganization. We support the diplomatic initiatives \naimed at finding a peaceful political solution to the \ncrisis in Syria, in particular the agreement reached by \nthe United States and Russia on eliminating chemical \nweapons in that country. \n\nThe prohibition of the use or threat of use of \nchemical weapons is absolute. The events of 21 August \noutside Damascus are unacceptable. The dismantling \nand destruction of the Syrian arsenals, under the \nauspices of the Organization for the Prohibition of \nChemical Weapons and the Security Council, must be \nimmediate and unconditional. There can be no room \nfor dilatory tactics or blackmail. Mexico supports the \nconvening of the \u201cGeneva II\u201d international conference \non Syria as soon as possible, with the goal of achieving \nlasting peace there.\n\nThe challenges we face today compel us to seek \na Security Council that is truly representative of the \ninternational community, without positions of privilege \nreserved for a few; a Council that is transparent and \naccountable; and a Council that acknowledges that a \nveto does not work in situations involving genocide, \nwar crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nMexico believes that disarmament should continue \nto be one of the key goals of the United Nations. In \nkeeping with my country\u2019s longstanding contributions \nto the cause of disarmament, in February 2014 in \nNayarit, on Mexico\u2019s Pacific coast, we will host the \nsecond Conference on the Humanitarian Impact of \nNuclear Weapons.\n\nHuman security is also affected by the irresponsible \nuse of, and illicit trafficking in, conventional weapons. \nMexico therefore welcomes the adoption of the Arms \nTrade Treaty. Demonstrating great vision, the Mexican \nSenate has approved the Treaty, and I deposited our \ninstrument of ratification yesterday. We will comply \nwith it immediately, even before its entry into force \nworldwide. Mexico calls on all States to ratify the \nTreaty, which is a testament to the Organization\u2019s ability \nto achieve common solutions to shared challenges. I \nalso hope that the United Nations will show the same \nwillingness to take on the fight against sexual violence \nas a weapon in conflict situations.\n\nMexico is also acting responsibly in dealing \nwith the global drug problem. Like Chile, Colombia \nand others, Mexico believes we should evaluate \ninternationally agreed policies in the search for more \neffective responses based on a focus on health and \na framework of respect for human rights and from a \nperspective of damage control. The goal must be the \nwell-being of society in all its aspects. \n\nAlong with Costa Rica, Paraguay and others, we \nbelieve we should give priority to prevention so as \nto reduce the impact on health and, in particular, the \nviolence associated with drug problems. Similarly, it \nwould be helpful to strengthen international cooperation \nso as to reduce the illegal flows of arms and money that \nfuel criminal networks. \n\nAlong with Guatemala and others, we believe the \nnew global strategy should be based on an open and \ninclusive debate leading up to the special session of the \nGeneral Assembly scheduled for 2016. We welcome the \nAntigua Declaration issued at the General Assembly of \nthe Organization of American States as a first step in \nthe right direction towards the 2016 special session.\n\nThe fight against organized crime must always \nrespect the rule of law and human rights. When there is \na risk or merely a possibility that the right to privacy of \nany citizen might be infringed by any Government, we \nhave demanded that it be investigated and the parties \nresponsible held accountable. In Mexico, the protection \nof personal data is a human right guaranteed by the \nConstitution.\n\nMexico believes firmly in free trade and in \nbuilding mechanisms that promote the free circulation \n\n\n\f\nof people, goods and capital. That is why we and Chile, \nColombia and Peru formed the Pacific Alliance, which \nis organized in a spirit of openness and plurality, as \nthe heterogeneity of its members with observer status \nreflects. Our only goal is for the Pacific Alliance \nto be an inclusive, useful tool for the promotion of \nprosperity for the citizens of our nations. That is also \nthe spirit behind our work this year in the Association \nof Caribbean States.\n\nDuring this session of the Assembly we will \nbegin the process of evaluating our achievement of \nthe Millennium Development Goals and outlining \na road map for the post-2015 agenda. The success \nof the Millennium Development Goals is rooted in \nfocusing the actions of the international community \non clear and ambitious targets. Despite that, it is \nimportant to acknowledge that painful inequality and \na lack of participation and access to development still \npersist among the most vulnerable groups in highly \nindustrialized countries, as well as developing ones. \nPoverty, inequality and social exclusion exacerbate \nconflicts and help to undermine the rule of law. The \ndevelopment agenda must be based on a commitment \nto inclusion. Policies that bring together mechanisms \npromoting development and openness to innovation, \ncoupled with political determination on the part of the \ninternational community, will enable us to advance \ntowards a world with opportunities for all.\n\nInclusion should be a central premise in the \nnegotiations on the post-2015 development agenda, \nthus ensuring not only a narrowing of the poverty and \ninequality gaps but also active participation by society\u2019s \nmost vulnerable groups. That is why we will convene \na meeting in Mexico to promote a global perspective \non inclusion, in which Governments, civil society and \nUnited Nations agencies, funds and programmes will \nparticipate with the aim of defining the parameters of \ninclusion and its impact on development policies, so \nwe can establish minimum thresholds for inclusion to \nwhich every human being is entitled. In that context, we \nacknowledge the high-level events being held within the \nframework of this session of the General Assembly \u2014 on \npersons with disabilities and on international migration \nand development. Full observance of the rights of such \ngroups is an essential component of the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda.\n\nMexico is a multi-ethnic and multicultural nation \nthat is proud of its 68 indigenous peoples. That is why \nwe attach such importance to the World Conference on \nIndigenous Peoples,to be held in 2014, for which great \nevent we will host a preparatory meeting.\n\nOur experience shows that to achieve the goal \nof inclusion, we must consider every dimension of \npoverty \u2014 lack of income and financial inclusion, \nnutrition, health, education, housing and basic services. \nBoth through our national crusade against hunger \nand as a member of the Group of 20, Mexico has \nsought to place such deficiencies at the centre of the \ndebate. The innovative feature of our national crusade \nagainst hunger lies in its focus on a multidimensional \nmeasurement of poverty and in the fact that it seeks \nto overcome the deficiencies thus measured in order to \narrive at sustainable and structural ways of mitigating \nthe conditions that lead to hunger.\n\nIn the spirit of moving Mexico forward, we are \nundertaking transformative reforms for increasing \naccess to quality education, telecommunication, the \nfinancial system and social security. Strengthening \ninternational support will be crucial to implementing \nthe post-2015 development agenda. We must meet \nthe international commitments on financing for \ndevelopment agreed on under the Monterrey Consensus \nand achieve coordinated, transparent cooperation \nwith clear goals. That is why Mexico will host the \nfirst High-level Meeting of the Global Partnership for \nEffective Development Cooperation next year. Central \nto the agenda for that forum will be the mobilization of \ndomestic resources for development. Mexico therefore \nagrees with all measures that help prevent the erosion \nof our tax base and its migration to jurisdictions with \nlow or no taxes.\n\nToday the world is coming closer together, because \nwe have a greater global awareness. We are all affected \nby the suffering and challenges of other nations, \nwherever we are. Let us capitalize on that awareness in \norder to include those who are excluded and to extend \na hand to those who have not had our opportunities. \nLet us do what is necessary to make our world a place \nwhere greater equality is a reality. \n\nPresident Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto wishes to leave no \ndoubt as to his and Mexico\u2019s commitment to a peaceful \nworld, a world in which the best causes of humankind \nmake headway, an inclusive world in which inequalities \nare reduced and extreme poverty is eradicated and a \nworld in which economic growth produces prosperity \nfor all. From this rostrum, Mexico declares its firmly \nheld belief in its global responsibilities. \n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to begin by congratulating \nthe President of the General Assembly on his election. \nI offer him Malaysia\u2019s full cooperation and support as \nhe seeks to further the cause of peace and prosperity.\n\nThree years ago, I stood before the General Assembly \nand called for a global movement of moderates (see \nA/65/PV.19). It was a call to reject extremism in all its \nforms, because the real divide is not between East and \nWest or between the developed and developing worlds \nor between Muslims, Christians and Jews. It is between \nmoderates and extremists of all religions. \n\nMuch has changed since 2010, when a current of \nprotest and reform surged through the Middle East and \nNorth Africa. Out of the heat of the Arab Spring, new \nquestions arose about the pace of democratic change, \nthe role of Islam in politics, and the need for more \ninclusive development. \n\nBut the search for answers to those questions \nhas been put on hold. As authoritarian regimes have \nfallen, and Governments have been swept away by \npolitical change, extremists have tried to fill that space. \nMotivated by ideology, politics and religion, they have \nsought refuge from the hard work of development in \nthe unholy practice of violence. Conflicts have spilled \nacross borders, inflaming old tensions and igniting new \nones. All over the world, extremism is claiming lives \nand crushing opportunity. This affects all of us, but it \nis one people of one faith who suffer the most. I believe \nthe greatest threat to Muslims today comes not from the \noutside world, but from within.\n\nThe conflict between Sunni and Shia threatens \nthe lives and livelihoods of millions of Muslims. Our \nreligion, which was founded on peace and premised \non tolerance, is now being twisted by extremists who \nare deploying false arguments to foster division and \njustify violence. Across the Islamic world, extremists \nare wrapping their perverse agenda in religious cloth, \ntearing families, countries and the Ummah apart. With \neach new atrocity, tensions are wound tighter and peace \nseems further away.\n\nThe corrosive influence of extremism cannot be \ncountered easily, but we are not too powerless to act. \nI believe that moderation in religion and the political \nprocess can stem the loss of life and liberty in the Muslim \nworld. Behind the tragic violence, there is a battle \nbeing waged for the future of Islam. By reaffirming our \ncommitment to moderation and solving the political \nproblems that drive instability, we can seize back the \ncentre ground. We can marginalize the extremists and \nadvance an agenda for peace, harmony and justice.\n\nAround the world, Muslims have watched in despair \nas conflict tears into some of our oldest communities. \nRarely in our history has the Ummah faced violence \non this scale. Right now, the world\u2019s attention is rightly \nfocused on Syria. United Nations investigators have \nconcluded that the focus of the war has shifted along \nethnic and religious lines and become overtly sectarian. \nA conflict that began with anti-Government protests \nthreatens to descend into a war of ethnic cleansing.\n\nWith fighters from Hizbullah engaging on Syrian \nsoil, the conflict now threatens Lebanon, too. Last \nmonth, after car bombs killed dozens in Beirut, 42 \npeople died in explosions outside Sunni mosques. \nCommunities are dividing along religious lines, with \nhard-line preachers urging violence between Sunni and \nShia. \n\nMeanwhile, the security situation in Iraq continues \nto unravel, as Sunni extremist groups and Shia militia \nstruggle for control. Over the past four months, nearly \n3,000 people have been killed. In the past week alone, \nthree funerals have been bombed in Baghdad. Women \nand children have been blown apart while mourning. \nAgain, the violence is carried out between Sunni \n\n\n\f\nand Shia. In one Iraqi town, four children from one \nShia family were slain with knives. In another, local \npeople \u2014 neighbours for generations \u2014 have built blast \nwalls to keep themselves apart. Forced displacements \nare growing.\n\nIn Pakistan, bombings have wrecked the city of \nQuetta, killing hundreds. Revenge attacks spread to \nLahore and bombs have been detonated in Karachi. \nIn August, militants ambushed buses, dividing the \npassengers according to belief. Those who answered \nincorrectly were executed.\n\nEach of these conflicts has a distinct cause, but they \nfollow a darkly familiar path: emboldened by political \nfailures, radical preachers and militant groups turn civil \nconflicts into wider religious wars. Yet the preaching of \nsuch violence is completely counter to the Islamic faith. \nThe Holy Koran not only condemns suicide, unjust war \nand retribution by force; it also makes clear the Prophet\u2019s \ndesire for Muslims to live in peace with one another and \ntheir neighbours. It says \u201cAnd if they incline to peace, \nthen incline to it and rely upon Allah\u201d (The Holy Koran, \nVIII:61) and that \u201cwhoever kills a soul, unless for a soul \nor for corruption in the land \u2014 it is as if he had slain \nmankind entirely\u201d (ibid., V:32). It also holds that \u201cthere \nshall be no compulsion in religion\u201d (ibid., II:256).\n\nIt should come as no surprise that there is no \nscriptural basis for the atrocities being committed in \nthe name of Islam. Under the six higher objectives of \nIslamic law, the first and foremost is the protection and \npreservation of life. Yet even during Ramadan, our holy \nmonth, when contemplation, devotion and compassion \nreign uppermost in Muslim minds, the extremists would \nnot stop. More than 4,400 people died this Ramadan in \nSyria, 371 in Iraq and 120 in Pakistan. This is a burden \nwe can no longer afford to bear. It is time to end the \nkilling; it is time to concentrate instead on building a \ncommon agenda for peace and prosperity.\n\nThere are two things we can do. First of all, I \nbelieve that peace-loving Muslims \u2014 the overwhelming \nmajority of Muslims \u2014 should unite against the \nextremists who use our religion as an excuse to commit \nviolence. And one of the most powerful tools we have \nto do so is al-wasatiyyah \u2014 the practice of moderation. \nThe Holy Koran says that \u201cwe have made you into a \ncommunity that is justly balanced\u201d (ibid., II:143). This \nconcept of balance and moderation, of social justice \nwithin our faith, is a central tenet of Islam. It asks of us \nthat we hold to the principles displayed by the Prophet \nMuhammad in the Medina Charter.\n\nOur task therefore is to reclaim our faith by \narticulating clearly the true nature of Islam as a religion \nof peace, moderation and tolerance. We should speak \nthat message clearly so that all may hear it and stand firm \nagainst the minority who use Islam to further violent \nand unjust ends. We should not mistake moderation for \nweakness. To face those baying for violence and call \ninstead for calm is a sign not of frailty, but of strength. \nMuslim leaders should speak up and condemn such \nviolence, lest their silence be mistaken for acceptance.\n\nModeration can be practiced at the national level, \nas it is in Malaysia, by choosing mutual respect and \ninclusivity and strengthening the bonds between \ndifferent communities and faiths. All countries \nshould reinforce their commitment to the principles \nof moderation, not just in religion, but for sustainable \ndevelopment and stable economic growth.\n\nModeration can also direct regional policy. It sits \nat the heart of Malaysia\u2019s efforts to bring peace to the \nsouthern Philippines and to Thailand\u2019s restive South. \nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which \nendorsed the Global Movement of Moderates, has made \na commitment to the peaceful settlement and non-use \nof force in territorial disputes. \n\nAt the international level, moderation can guide \nour approach to the great global challenges of our \nage: violent extremism, sustainable development and \nequitable growth.\n\nSecondly, we should give our all to resolve the \npolitical problems that raise tensions in the Muslim \nworld, starting with Syria. We cannot underline strongly \nenough the need for a Syrian-led inclusive political \nprocess. Malaysia is against any unilateral action to \nresolve the conflict. All sides must come together to \nwork out a political settlement. We welcome the recent \nUnited States-Russia framework agreement, condemn \nwithout reservation the use of chemical weapons, and \ncall on the international community to intensify its \nefforts to explore all possible diplomatic options for \npeace under the auspices of the United Nations.\n\nWe must also find the vision and political will to \ncommit to a just solution for Palestine. We fervently \nhope that progress towards a viable Palestinian State, \nbased on pre-1967 borders and with East Jerusalem \nas its capital, will be made, and that the United States \n\n\n\f\nand other members of the Quartet will continue to play \ntheir role as honest brokers in the process. Only with \npeace can there be development and dignity for the \nPalestinian people.\n\nFinally, we should continue to focus on building \nstronger and more prosperous societies predicated on \nthe rule of law and the practice of democracy. The Arab \nSpring showed that the Muslim world is crying out for \nchange. Governments must answer that call. We must \nprovide good governance to fight corruption, create \njobs to tackle poverty, and deliver sustainable growth \nthat builds a world of opportunity for our citizens. We \nmust create economies in which people can fulfil their \nown aspirations, not those of extremists.\n\nBy acting to solve our most difficult political \nproblems, we can bring an end to the immediate \nsuffering in Syria, in Palestine and in the wider world. \nBy committing to the cause of moderation, Muslims \ncan secure something even greater. We can reclaim our \nreligion, choosing harmony and acceptance over division \nand conflict, and we can broadcast a vision of Islam as \nit is understood by Muslims around the world \u2014 as a \nreligion of peace, tolerance and moderation.\n\nLast month, when militants attacked those buses in \nPakistan, a 19 year-old Sunni student named Ghulam \nMustafa stood up for such a vision. Confronting the \nSunni gunmen, he said killing Shiites was wrong. \nGhulam was shot dead, but his life was not lost in vain. \nWith guns to their heads, the Sunnis on the bus refused to \nidentify the Shia passengers whom the gunmen wanted \nto kill. In their defiance, we see the true measure of \ncourage and the true test of faith. Under unimaginable \npressure, facing the greatest possible threat, they chose \nto stand with their brothers and sisters. They chose \nunity over division. Faced with unimaginable pressure, \nand the greatest possible threat, we must summon the \nwill to do the same.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of His Majesty the Sultan and \nthe people of Brunei Darussalam, I wish to congratulate \nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. We thank our \nformer President, Mr. Vuk Jeremi., for his efforts and \ncontributions over the past year.\n\nLet me begin by expressing our sincere condolences \nto the Government and the people of Kenya and to the \nfamilies of the victims of the terrorist attack. Such an \nact deserves our condemnation. Our deepest sympathies \nalso go to those affected by the recent earthquake in \nPakistan. \n\nThirteen years ago before the Assembly, our \nleaders made a promise to our peoples to fulfil their \nhopes and expectations for a better life. This is why we \nsee the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as a \nhighly important global partnership. It has shown us \nthat progress can be made if we work together locally, \nregionally and internationally. I would therefore like to \nplace on record our expression of appreciation to our \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his predecessor, \nMr. Kofi Annan, for the support and commitment \nprovided by the United Nations to realize that historic \ninitiative.\n\nWe are now approaching the end of the 15-year \nperiod. Like many other nations, Brunei Darussalam \nhas been able to learn much from its experiences in \nimplementing the MDGs. We understand the high \nexpectations for all to do well. However, we need to \nconsider the problems that some Member States are \nstruggling with. Those include limitations to natural \nresources, political conflict, socioeconomic problems \nand natural disasters. That is why this year\u2019s theme is \nso appropriate. It is focused on setting the stage. For \n\nus in Brunei Darussalam, it means having a national \nvision \u2014 Brunei Vision 2035 \u2014 that clearly provides \ndirection towards attaining a dynamic and sustainable \neconomy in the interests of our people.\n\nIn line with the Vision, we place great emphasis \non helping our younger generation realize their hopes. \nWe have done this by providing quality education, \nencouraging innovation and creating better job \nopportunities. We also do what we can to assist fellow \ndeveloping countries, either bilaterally or in partnership \nwith other countries and international organizations, \nin human resource development, offering scholarships \nto study in Brunei Darussalam and training under \ncommunity outreach programmes within the region. We \nhope that the people-to-people approach will promote \ncultural exchanges and understanding.\n\nAt the same time, our regional work has been \nstrongly influenced by other Member States\u2019 efforts \nto achieve the MDGs. Within the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN), we have an agreed \nplan to achieve an ASEAN community by 2015. Brunei \nDarussalam, as this year\u2019s ASEAN Chairman, has \nchosen the theme \u201cOur people, our future together\u201d. \nIt signifies our people\u2019s role in ASEAN\u2019s community-\nbuilding efforts. In addition, we have also encouraged \nour member States to start working on an ASEAN \nplan beyond 2015, to further strengthen our mission \nin promoting peace, stability and prosperity. We will \nalso continue to work together to strategically position \nASEAN in the wider region and the world at large. \n\nIn that regard, we are pleased that Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon has accepted our invitation to \ncome to Brunei Darussalam for the fifth ASEAN-\nUnited Nations Summit. We look forward to sharing \nour views and experiences with him, and hope that will \nstrengthen cooperation between our Association and \nthe United Nations.\n\nWe are also encouraged by the recommendations \nput forward in the recent report of the High-level Panel \nof Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Agenda on how \nwe can better assist our people in their daily lives by \nproviding food security and quality education and \neradicating extreme poverty. Overall, the MDGs have \noffered us many lessons indeed, and now it is time for \nall of us to move forward. Regardless of the statistics \nof who has achieved the goals and who has not, we feel \nthat much has been attained through the very concept of \nthe MDGs. The Goals have opened up opportunities to \nevery Member to develop in its own way and to involve \nits people in that development, even beyond 2015. \n\nUnfortunately, the options open to some people are \nseverely limited. That is so when the basic, fundamental \nright of self-determination has been denied. We refer \nparticularly to the people of Palestine, whom we \nbelieve can attest to that. Their legitimate struggle for \na homeland of their own remains unresolved. Hence, \nwe support the calls of the international community for \nintensified efforts towards realizing this basic right, \nwhich we take for granted today.\n\nThe date of 29 November 2012 was indeed a \nmemorable day in the history of Palestine, when it was \naccorded observer State status in the United Nations \n(see A/67/PV.44). I would like once again to express \nour support for Palestine\u2019s full membership and for its \npeople\u2019s legitimate struggle to exercise their right to \ntheir own independent and sovereign State.\n\nThe worsening situation in Syria continues to be of \nserious concern. We join the international community \nin condemning the use of chemical weapons, which \nhas caused the loss of lives in that country. More \nimportantly, we support all efforts, particularly those \nof the United Nations, to find a peaceful solution to the \ncrisis. In that regard, we welcome the United States-\nRussia framework agreement for the elimination of \nSyrian chemical weapons and the recent adoption of \nSecurity Council resolution 2118 (2013) on Syria.\n\nBefore I conclude, we would like to thank the \nSecretary-General and all his staff, as well as the \nUnited Nations Volunteers, for their hard work. We \nhighly respect the peacekeepers for the sacrifices they \nhave made in the maintenance of international peace \nand stability. We hope that our efforts within various \nUnited Nations agencies and bodies will lead us to the \nfuture that we all want.\n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate \nPresident Ashe very warmly on his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth \nsession. I congratulate also Mr. Vuk Jeremi. for his able \nleadership as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-seventh session. I admire the Secretary-General, \nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his wisdom, bold initiatives and \nsuccesses as head of the United Nations.\n\nRapid technological innovations are transforming \nour world. The changes involved are also creating new \nconflicts within and among States. The vulnerable, the \ndeprived and the disadvantaged have been the most \naffected. That reminds me of my father and the Father \nof the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, \nand his visionary call, in his first appearance before the \nGeneral Assembly, in 1974, for a world order based on \npeace and justice and a global economic arrangement to \nfree the world of poverty, hunger and aggression. As his \ndaughter, I am proud to have been among leaders who \nadopted the Millennium Declaration in 2000, to have \nbeen at the review of the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) in 2010 and to be participating now \nin the transition from the MDGs to the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda.\n\nI hope that this year\u2019s theme \u2014 \u201cThe post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage\u201d \u2014 will help us \nto design a pragmatic strategy for those goals. The Open \nWorking Group on Sustainable Development Goals \nand the newly established High-level Political Forum \nare making good progress. Our experience also will \nbe useful in overcoming the challenges to the MDGs \nby 2015 and in preparing the post-2015 development \nagenda.\n\nBangladesh has submitted to the United Nations \na draft of the post-2015 development agenda that \ncovers socioeconomic and environmental goals and the \nresources required for achieving them. We also held a \nGlobal Leadership Meeting on Population Dynamics \nin Dhaka, whose declaration placed human individuals \nat the centre of the entire development agenda. The \ndeclaration incorporated population growth, ageing, \nurbanization and migration as the priority issues. \nThe meeting also strongly identified the need for \nmainstreaming migration in the post-2015 development \nagenda, particularly to accommodate the expected \nclimate migrants.\n\nOur aim is to become a middle-income country \nand to realize our Vision 2021 by setting goals that \nare in line with the MDGs. We have already met or \nare on track to meet Millennium Development Goals \n1 through 6. Poverty has been reduced from 56.6 per \ncent in 1991 to below 26 per cent today. In the past four \nand a half years, the average gross domestic product \ngrowth rate remained at 6.4 per cent; 50 million people \nhave joined the middle income group; export earnings \nrose from $10.53 billion in 2006 to $27.03 billion \ntoday; remittances increased from $5 billion in 2006 \nto $14.5 billion; foreign currency reserves improved \nfrom $3.49 billion in 2006 to $16 billion; and power \nproduction capacity also increased from 3,200 \nmegawatts in 2006 to 9,059 megawatts today, to name \na few indicators.\n\n\n\f\nBangladesh is therefore often called a model of \neconomic development and the standard-bearer of \nSouth Asia. Our achievements received an MDG award, \na South-South Award, a Global Diversity Award and \na food award for 2013 from the Food and Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations. Those recognitions \nwere achieved largely due to the practice of the \nprinciples found in the resolution entitled \u201cPeople\u2019s \nempowerment and development\u201d (resolution 67/107), \nwhich I submitted and which the General Assembly \nadopted at its sixty-seventh session. \n\nUsing state-of-the-art digital technology, people \ntoday are getting more than 200 services from 4,582 \ndigitized Union Information and Service Centres. \nRural women are also receiving health-care services \nfrom 15,500 digitally interconnected community health \nclinics and union health centres, which have extended \nhealth-care services to people\u2019s doorsteps. Advanced \ncell phone technologies are also providing services to \nmore than 100 million subscribers.\n\nI believe that real national development is achievable \nonly through education. Education is the main driving \nforce for attaining the peace and prosperity of a nation \nand for upholding justice, the rule of law, democratic \nvalues and people\u2019s empowerment. Real development \nalso demands the empowerment of women and their \nequal participation with men in all walks of life. \n\nOur new educational policy provides girls free \neducation up to higher secondary school, monthly \nstipends for 11.9 million students of poor families, and \nfree textbooks to all students up to the secondary level. \nOur policies have also helped develop women leaders \nfrom the grass roots to the topmost level. In politics, \nso far, 14,000 women have been elected to local \nGovernment bodies and 70 to Parliament. Five women \nare serving as Ministers and one as Whip. Bangladesh \nis possibly the only nation today with women occupying \nthe position of Prime Minister, Speaker, Leader of the \nOpposition and Deputy Leader, all at the same time. \nThe 10 per cent of posts reserved for women have helped \nmany succeed in reaching high positions in the judicial \nand administrative branches, in diplomatic posts and in \nthe armed forces and law enforcement agencies.\n\nOur policies of empowering the people, particularly \nthe vulnerable, include social safety-net programmes, \nsuch as vulnerable group feeding and development; \nhousing and livelihood for the homeless; monthly \npensions for senior citizens, widows, destitute women, \ninsolvent freedom fighters and people with disabilities; \nmaternity allowances for a total of 4.3 million \npeople; and food and nutrition security for more than \n1 million rural people through One House, One Farm \nschemes, to name a few. The disadvantaged and the \nphysically challenged are provided with education, \nskill development and interest-free loans for self-\nemployment and, in the formal sector, a 1 per cent quota \nhas been reserved for them. For those with autism and \nother developmental disorders, a resolution on autism \nspectrum disorder was introduced by Bangladesh at \nthe sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly \n(resolution 67/82). It was adopted, unifying us all in our \nquest to provide them their rightful place in the world.\n\nHowever, our progress in all spheres has been \nsadly held back because of climate change. Fraught \nwith increasing natural disasters, Bangladesh faces \na calamitous future due to global warming and sea \nlevel rise. It is estimated that a 1\u02da Celsius increase in \ntemperature would lead to a 1 metre rise of the sea \nlevel, submerging one fifth of Bangladesh and forcing \n30 million climate migrants to move elsewhere, \nthereby creating crisis of a huge magnitude within \nand beyond our borders. I therefore reiterate the call \nthat I made at the sixty-fourth session of the General \nAssembly (see A/64/PV.4) for a legal regime to ensure \nthe social, cultural and economic rehabilitation of \nclimate migrants. I again call for a fast-track funding \nmechanism for least developed countries to ensure \nsustained funding for the realization of our adaptation \nand mitigation action plans on climate change.\n\nBangladesh achieved independence in 1971 \nthrough monumental sacrifices. Our sacrifice began \nwith bloodshed to preserve our mother tongue, \nBangla, on 21 February 1952. At my Government\u2019s \ninitiative, UNESCO immortalized that sacrifice in \n1999 by UNESCO by its declaration of 21 February as \nInternational Mother Language Day. The measures we \nhave taken so far in that regard include the establishment \nof the International Mother Language Institute in Dhaka \nand asking the United Nations to declare Bangla as one \nof its official languages. I thank the United Nations for \nintroducing a Bangla website and radio programme, \nand the United Nations Development Programme for \npublishing its Asian report in Bangla. \n\nDuring our 1971 war of liberation, Pakistani \noccupation forces \u2014 in collaboration with their local \ncohorts \u2014 perpetrated genocide, rape, arson and \ncrimes against humanity. More than 3 million people \nsacrificed their lives and a quarter of a million women \n\n\n\f\nlost their honour to achieve independence. Since then, \nit has been the ardent hope and aspiration of the nation \nto bring the perpetrators to justice. Accordingly, our \nGovernment constituted two war crimes tribunals \nunder the international crimes tribunals act of 1973 \nto try them. The trials are being held with the highest \nstandards of judicial practices. The successful \ncompletion of the trials would heal the wounds of \nwar and move Bangladesh on to the road of peace and \nprogress. I urge the international community to support \nthe trials process for the sake of justice, human rights \nand the rule of law. \n\nThe anti-liberation forces have always been working \nto destroy the secular nature of our nation. Under the \ndirect patronage of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party-\nJamaat alliance Government from 2001 to 2006, they \ncoalesced to form terrorist outfits, which began with \nbomb and grenade attacks killing people, especially \nsecular leaders and members of Parliament. On \n21 August 2004, they made an attempt to assassinate \nme by lobbing 13 grenades at a public rally that I was \naddressing to protest the grenade attack on the British \nHigh Commissioner on 21 May 2004. In that attack, \n24 people were killed and more than 500 injured. \nMiraculously, I survived. As members are aware, earlier \na more brutal attack was carried out, on 15 August \n1975, killing my father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur \nRahman, the Father of the Nation, and 18 members of \nmy family. My younger sister, Sheikh Rehana, and I \nsurvived only because we were out of the country at \nthat time. The gruesome attacks cemented my resolve \nto eliminate terrorism and to adopt tough anti-terrorism \nand anti-money-laundering acts. \n\nAt home, our Government is entrenching democracy \nin order to ideologically defeat terrorism and extremism. \nOur commissions on elections, anti-corruption, human \nrights and information have been strengthened. During \nour Government\u2019s tenure, the elections commission has \nconducted 5,777 elections, electing 63,995 persons to \nthe Parliament, city corporations, municipalities and \nother local bodies, without receiving any complaint. \nThe elections commission has therefore amply proven \nthat it can hold free, fair and credible national elections. \n\nWith respect to foreign affairs, we aim to cement \npeace by resolving outstanding issues with our \nneighbours, by increasing cooperation with them \nthrough strengthening connectivity and by maintaining \ngood relations with all countries of the world according \nto the dictum of the Father of the Nation, \u201cFriendship \ntowards all, malice towards none\u201d.\n\nOur commitment to global peace is proved by \nour role as a top troop-contributor in United Nations \npeacekeeping operations and as a Vice-Chair of the \nPeacebuilding Commission. It is also reflected by \nour position on disarmament and the nonproliferation \nagenda. During my first term as Prime Minister, from \n1996 to 2001, Bangladesh became the first South Asian \nnation to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \nTreaty and the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention. \nIn my current term, I am happy to again be the first in \nthe region to have signed the Arms Trade Treaty, and \nto have acceded to the remaining instruments of the \nConvention on Certain Conventional Weapons at this \nyear\u2019s treaty-signing event. Our role in world affairs \nis based on justice and democratic values, with the \naim of ensuring international peace and security and \nsupporting disarmament. \n\nThe promotion of cultural expression and interfaith \nand intercultural dialogue is essential for peace and \ndevelopment in the post-2015 era. My personal initiatives \nto disseminate those values at home and abroad were \nrecognized by UNESCO in 2012, when we were awarded \nthe Cultural Diversity Medal. Culture is integral to the \nidentity of every State Member of the United Nations. \nTherefore, my country has proposed \u2014 to UNESCO and \nin the General Assembly\u2019s thematic debate on culture \nand development \u2014 including culture as a theme of the \npost-2015 development agenda. I reiterate that call here \ntoday and request the support of all present.\n\nBangladesh is hampered by resource constraints \nand inadequate external assistance. To achieve the \nMDGs by 2015 and to implement the post-2015 \ndevelopment goals, we need our development partners \nto honour their pledges to contribute 0.7 per cent of \ngross national product (GNP) as official development \nassistance (ODA) and 0.2 per cent of GNP as ODA to \nthe least developed countries (LDCs). I urge them to \nalso grant LDCs duty-free and quota-free access to \ntheir markets, as well as an equal voice in the Bretton \nWoods and international financial institutions and \nthe free movement of labour. The implementation of \npart IV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \nis also essential for the benefit of both sending and \nreceiving countries.\n\nThe elaboration of the post-2015 development \nagenda is a daunting task for all States Members of the \n\n\n\f\nUnited Nations. We must be united in agreeing on a \ncommon framework for the development agenda that \nwould fulfil our aspiration to build a just, prosperous \nand sustainable world where no person or nation is \nleft behind. Bangladesh, representing 160 million \nprogressive and resilient people, will lead those efforts \nup front.\n\nThe globalized world has unique complexities \nthat sometimes threaten peace. Justice-based policies \nare imperative to eradicate such threats. Justice is \nthe panacea for peace that enables development and \nprogress, which in turn dispel the challenges posed to \nfreedom, democracy, human rights, the environment \nand the equitable sharing of transboundary resources \nsuch as water, among others, as well as the challenges \nposed by climate change. \n\nOur resolution on the culture of peace, introduced \nat the Assembly every year, is drafted in that spirit and \nis always adopted by consensus. It conveys the message \nof mutual respect for peoples and nations in our bid \nfor a world of peace and promise. I believe that we all \naspire to such a world for our future generations.\n"

        "file_text": "The theme chosen for the sixty-eighth \nsession of the General Assembly is \u201cThe post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage\u201d. The attainment \nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in the \nCentral African Republic has been compromised as a \nresult of the crisis that we are going through. I shall \ntherefore devote my statement entirely to the situation \nthat prevails in my country.\n\nAs national leaders gather here in New York to share \ntheir concerns in a world where violence, hate, extreme \npoverty and armed conflict are ever more present and \na miserable generation lives in indescribable suffering, \nI have the onerous duty of taking the floor as Prime \nMinister and Head of the Transitional Government \nof National Unity of the Central African Republic to \naddress, from this lofty rostrum at the United Nations, \n\n\n\f\nthe human tragedy afflicting the people of my country, \nwhose suffering seems to have been forgotten by the \ninternational community.\n\nAt the outset, I and my delegation would like to \nconvey to Mr. John W. Ashe our heartfelt congratulations \non his election to serve as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. I also wish to \nacknowledge the remarkable work carried out under \nthe leadership of Mr. Vuk Jeremi., his predecessor. \nIn addition, I wish to express my utmost gratitude to \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his energy and \npragmatism and, in particular, for the special attention \nthat he continually pays to my country and its people.\n\nI must also pay well-deserved tribute to the Heads \nof State of the Economic Community of West African \nStates and of the Central African Economic and \nMonetary Community, who unfailingly come to my \ncountry\u2019s aid as it suffers from multiple crises, and to the \nUnited Nations, the European Union, the International \nOrganization of la Francophonie and France for their \nunflagging support to the Central African Republic \nin these very trying times. Our thanks go, too, to the \nUnited States Government, which has been fighting \nwith us side by side against the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army \n(LRA) of Joseph Kony.\n\nThe terrible news of the terrorist attack in Nairobi \nreached us as we gathered here in New York. My \ncountry condemns that and other senseless attacks and \nexpresses its condolences to the afflicted families and \nto the Kenyan people.\n\nThe tragedy affecting the Syrian people for more \nthan two years demands action from the international \ncommunity. The use of chemical weapons against the \ncivilian population must be strongly condemned. That \nis why my country supports the actions under way to \ndismantle the chemical arsenal in Syria, with emphasis \non a diplomatic resolution of that crisis.\n\nWhile Africa has the dubious honour of \ndistinguishing itself by the acts of violence of all sorts \nthat occur there, the continent still gives us grounds \nfor hope. Only a few days ago, Ibrahim Boubacar Keita \nwas elected President of Mali, a country in the throes \nof a crisis that has undermined its national unity. We \nconvey to him our warmest congratulations and our \ninexhaustible encouragement in his efforts to restore \npeace and sow the seeds of democracy in his country.\n\nIn the half-century of its independence, the \nCentral African Republic has experienced a series \nof cyclical political and military crises, which have \nled to a succession of political regimes. The decades \nof recurrent crisis have created constant instability, \nwhich has led to the disintegration of the State. The \nhome-grown causes of this situation derive from the \nfragility of the State, a lack of political dialogue, a \nfailure to abide by commitments in the management of \npublic affairs, a refusal to let go of power, tribalism, \nnepotism and the politics of exclusion. In addition, \nthere are now phenomena previously unheard of in the \nCentral African Republic \u2014 impassioned inter-ethnic \nand interreligious tensions that remind us of the \ntragedies suffered by other African countries.\n\nThe external causes are due to the collateral effects \nof the crises in Darfur and Libya, as well as the long \nconflict in the Sudan, which led to the independence of \nSouth Sudan; the conflict in the Democratic Republic \nof the Congo; the actions of residual groups of former \nChadian rebels; and the terrorist activities of Joseph \nKony\u2019s LRA in the south-east of the country. The \nvarious disturbances have led to the circulation of \na large quantity of military weapons of all calibres \nthroughout our country. Those weapons have gravely \nimpaired the security and the humanitarian situation in \nthe Central African Republic and led to serious human \nrights violations; massacres of civilian populations; \nkidnappings; summary executions; mass rapes; \nlarge-scale pillaging and arson, including the burning \nof private houses, public buildings and grain silos; the \ndesecration of places of worship; and the degradation of \nnatural resources and wildlife.\n\nThe Central African Republic is thus faced \nwith multifaceted challenges that require immediate \naction to restore the security of people and property \nthroughout the territory. There must be protection of \nand humanitarian assistance to vulnerable sectors of the \npopulation, including internally displaced persons and \nrefugees. State administration must be re-established \nthroughout our territory. We also need to restore social \ncohesion and national harmony. We must revive our \neconomy, manage public finances and organize general \nelections. In accordance with the commitments made \nto the Heads of State and Government of the Economic \nCommunity of Central African States (ECCAS), the \nGovernment plans to establish conditions for a return \nto security, peace and constitutional order by 2015.\n\nThe goal at the end of the period of peaceful \ntransition, which every citizen in the Central African \nRepublic longs for, is a country where peace and security \n\n\n\f\nare guaranteed in all sectors of political, economic and \nsocial life, where disarmament, demobilization and \nreintegration are successfully managed and where free, \ntransparent and credible elections are held, thereby \nensuring the designation of legitimate authorities in the \ncontry.\n\nIn compliance with the commitments made in the \n11 January 2013 Libreville Agreement and the 18 April \n2013 N\u2019Djamena Declaration, under the auspices of \nthe Heads of State of ECCAS, we have established \ntransitional institutions, including the Government \nof National Unity, in which due regard is paid to \ngeographical and political balance; and the National \nTransitional Council, a legislative and constituent \ntransitional body. We have adopted a constitutional \ntransitional charter and an organization act relating \nto the transitional constitutional court. We have also \nappointed and sworn in the members of the court, and \nthe Head of State of the transition has now taken his \noath of office. The last institution, namely, the high \ncommunications council, will soon be established. \nThe next elections will be organized by our national \nauthority for elections, which will be established in the \ndays to come.\n\nWe are trying to re-establish our defence forces \nwith help from the international community, but that \nwill be possible only if some basic conditions are met. \nThe Head of State and the Government of National \nUnity are tackling that extremely difficult task.\n\nFollowing the violence, killings and looting in the \nBoyrabe and Boeing neighbourhoods in the city of \nBangui, measures have been taken to ban former S\u00e9l\u00e9ka \nelements from maintaining order. Now the mission rests \nsolely with the gendarmerie and the police. A ceremony \nof reconciliation took place between the officers of \nthe Central African Armed Forces and those of the \nformer S\u00e9l\u00e9ka rebellion. The S\u00e9l\u00e9ka coalition has been \ndissolved, and we are trying to create a dynamic fusion \nof the latter with the Central African Armed Forces.\n\nWith regard to the encampment of the former \nS\u00e9l\u00e9ka coalition, 15 sites have been established in the \nprovinces in order to bring together the former S\u00e9l\u00e9ka \nrebels for identification and disarmament and to select \nthose who could possibly join the army. While efforts \nwere under way to do that, new outbreaks of violence \nerupted in certain prefectures of the Central African \nRepublic, at Bossangoa and Bouca, involving armed \nclashes between former S\u00e9l\u00e9ka elements and organized \nself-defence groups, who claimed to be supporters of the \nformer President and wanted to regain power. Muslim \nfamilies were massacred, which led to extremely \ncruel reprisals by the former S\u00e9l\u00e9ka elements against \nChristian populations and innocent civilians.\n\nAccordingly, the Head of State, in agreement with \nthe Government of National Unity, took 10 measures \nto strengthen security: the appointment of a Minister \nof Security from civil society to head the Ministry \nof Public Security; the arrest and arraignment of \npersons suspected of crimes, violence and looting in \nthe areas of Bangui concerned and the sentencing of \n16 former S\u00e9l\u00e9ka members to eight years in prison, \nby which the Government demonstrated its resolve \nto combat impunity; the entrusting of all operations \nto the police and the gendarmerie alone; the placing \nof the gendarmerie and police under the Ministry \nof Public Security so that manpower and material \nresources could be shared to ensure effective security \nthroughout the territory; the dismantling of the former \nS\u00e9l\u00e9ka coalition and the Convention of Patriots for \nJustice and Peace; the removal of S\u00e9l\u00e9ka elements \nfrom police stations, private houses and administrative \nbuildings to restore security throughout the territory; \nthe resumption of police service in areas long occupied \nby former S\u00e9l\u00e9ka elements as a corollary to the release \nof persons arrested by them; the launch of operations \nto disarm former S\u00e9l\u00e9ka elements who refused to be \nquartered in the barracks assigned to them; the transfer \nof approximately 1,200 former S\u00e9l\u00e9ka members to two \nsites in the provinces of Sibut and Bossemb\u00e9l\u00e9, pending \nthe disarmament, demobilization and reintegration \nprogramme; and the initiation by the Head of State of a \nsocial dialogue through meetings with various sectors \nof the population, notably victims of former S\u00e9l\u00e9ka \nelements.\n\nThe 5 August 2013 report of the Secretary-General \n(S/2013/470) on the situation in the Central African \nRepublic paints a very dark and chaotic picture of the \nhumanitarian and security situation that reveals the \nreality of the daily lives of the Central African people. \nMoreover, since early August, armed confrontations in \nthe north-west have led to a considerably deteriorated \nhumanitarian situation in that region, where clashes \nhave occurred between former S\u00e9l\u00e9ka elements and \nself-defence groups and groups that support the \nformer President. It is important to note that at present \nthe humanitarian situation is utterly catastrophic. \nApproximately 4.6 million Central Africans are \naffected by the crisis, that is, every single person in our \ncountry. There are approximately 1.6 million internally \n\n\n\f\ndisplaced persons who are in dire need of assistance, \nand approximately 60,000 children are at risk of \ndying of malnutrition.Approximately 62,000 people \nsought refuge in neighbouring countries, including \nand principally 40,500 in the Democratic Republic \nof the Congo. At least 650,000 children are unable \nto go to school. More than 484,000, or 10.6 per cent \nof our population, are facing a very serious situation \nof food insecurity. Around 3,500 children have been \nrecruited by armed groups. More than 13,700 people \non antiretroviral medications are at risk of not being \nable to follow their treatments because of possible \ninterruption of the supply chain. Less than 20 per cent \nof the country\u2019s health-care facilities are working. That \nis the humanitarian situation caused by insecurity.\n\nGiven that backdrop, the international community \nhas now undertaken to rush to the assistance of the \nCentral African Republic. Accordingly, 3,652 military \nand civilian personnel will make up the African-led \nInternational Support Mission in the Central African \nRepublic. It will take over from the Mission for the \nConsolidation of Peace in the Central African Republic, \nwhich has been in the country for several years under \ndifferent designations. \n\nOn behalf of my country, I would like to extend \nmy appreciation and thanks to Cameroon, the Congo, \nGabon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and \nChad, which, for the time being, are the only countries \ncontributing troops to the force. It is our hope that \nother African countries will follow their example; \nI understand that Burundi is getting ready to send a \nbattalion with 450 troops.\n\nI hope to see the international community step up \nits efforts and continue to be supportive of the Central \nAfrican Republic as it seeks lasting peace. In that \nrespect, I would note the urgent appeal issued by many \nStates for the greater involvement of the United Nations \nin resolving the crisis in the Central African Republic. \nKeeping in mind that the Central African Republic is \na crumbling State, that appeal is for us a request for \nassistance for a people who are at risk and for a gesture \nof strong solidarity. It is therefore a matter of urgency \nthat the International Support Mission should become \noperational quickly under the auspices of the African \nUnion, taking over from the former Multinational \nForce of the Central African Economic and Monetary \nCommunity.\n\nGiven the degree of the violence and the extent of \ndevastation, the new multinational force needs a clear \nand robust mandate from the Security Council in order \nto provide security, bring peace to the country and \nprotect civilians. It is also the duty of the international \ncommunity, however, to provide the financial, material \nand logistic resources needed to meet the many \nchallenges that my country is facing. The challenges \nare self-evident and enormous. Apart from providing \nsecurity in the country, organizing elections, restoring \nthe administration, providing judicial, economic and \nsocial reform are all part of the road map that was \ndrawn up in Libreville.\n\nThose imperatives are especially topical right \nnow as the rainy season is approaching and our \npeople are in a state of total destitution. The already \ncritical humanitarian situation is worsening, as \ndemonstrated by the vast number of internally displaced \npersons \u2014 between 1.5 million and 1.6 million. The \nproliferation of arms in Bangui and the deterioration of \nthe humanitarian situation and social atmosphere are \nlikely to jeopardize the success of the transition. Given \nthat avalanche of problems, the Government of National \nUnity has to set security, humanitarian, budgetary and \npolicy priorities.\n\nIf we are to be successful in stabilizing the \ncountry and bringing peace, we have to reinvent a \nnew programme of disarmament, demobilization and \nreintegration and we have to rethink how to reform \nthe security sector, for security is the keystone of the \ntransition and the need for innovative approaches is \ngreater now than ever before. We will not be able to meet \nthose challenges unless we get four kinds of assistance: \nfinancial, technical, material and humanitarian. \nOur partners need to be supportive of our transition, \nprovide urgent budgetary support and help us with their \nexpertise.\n\nThe current session of the General Assembly offers \nme once again an opportunity to beg the international \ninstitutions to commit to providing strong support and \nhigh-quality expertise in a coordinated, complementary, \ncoherent and transparent way. A failure to carry out the \ntransition will make our country impossible to govern, \nwhich would inevitably lead to a gray area at the heart \nof the African continent. \n\nThere are already several foreign armed groups in \nour country. The Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, which has \nbeen present in the south-east of the country since \n2008, has killed several hundreds people, raped dozens \nof women, abducted thousands of children and burned \nentire villages. The Vakaga region has been penetrated \n\n\n\f\nby traffickers and poachers from neighbouring \ncountries, including the Sudan. If the Central African \nState collapses, new criminal and terrorist networks \ncould settle in the country and destabilize the entire \nregion. While stability in Central Africa is a major \nconcern of the international community, that concern \nmust go beyond the minimal reactions and half-hearted \ncommitments that are too often features of international \nsupport for political transition.\n\nI recall that Ms. Valerie Amos, Under-Secretary-\nGeneral for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency \nRelief Coordinator, and Ms. Kristalina Georgieva, \nEuropean Commissioner for International Cooperation, \nHumanitarian Aid and Crisis Response, came to \nmy country in July 2013 and visited the devastated \npopulation of the city of Kaga Bandoro. When they \nreturned to Bangui, they told me about the heart-\nrending scenes they had witnessed. They had met a \nwoman who had lost all hope and who asked why the \nworld had abandoned her country. This survivor cried \nout in distress, saying, \u201cDo not abandon us.\u201d And her \nvoice is that of millions of others in the Central African \nRepublic who are calling for help. \n\nThe crisis in my country may be a national crisis, \nbut the solution, in its four dimensions \u2014 military, \nsecurity, humanitarian and financial \u2014 has to be \ninternational. There is no short-term alternative to the \nfull involvement of the international community to \nsave the Central African Republic. On 19 September in \nBamako, French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said that \n\n\u201cwhen the law is trampled upon, when women \nand children are being massacred, it is then that \nthe international community must rise up and \ndemonstrate solidarity\u201d. \nThe time has come for the international community to \nrise up and save the Central African Republic. It did so \nfor Mali; there is no reason why it should not do so for \nmy country. \nThe Central African people do not understand this \nkind of international solidarity, with one rule for one \ncountry and another rule for another. Now more than \never, action is needed to help a people in danger. Now \nmore than ever, every means that has already been \nused elsewhere must be mobilized to avert irreparable \nharm. The cry of distress from that poor woman from \nKaga Bandoro addressed to Ms. Valerie Amos and \nMs. Kristalina Georgieva is the same cry of 4.6 million \nCentral Africans to the international community, and it \nresonates like a last request to our universal conscience. \nA human tragedy that calls for urgent action is playing \nout before our eyes. Every day that passes brings its \nshare of bloodshed, women raped, children kidnapped \nand millions displaced or exiled.\n\nNow more than ever, therefore, action is needed \nfor my country\u2019s civilian population. If nothing is \ndone now, tomorrow will be too late. And in the face \nof history, the international community can no longer \nabjure its political and moral responsibilities.\n"

        "file_text": "In my lifetime, the \nworld has been sliced up and labelled in many different \nways: East and West; communism and capitalism; \nNorth and South; Christian and Muslim; developed \nand developing, and so on. But as we meet today, the \nmost important fault line is not one of geography, or \nideology, or religion, or wealth; it is the divide between \nthose societies which are open and those which are \nclosed. Open societies choose democracy and freedom \nat home, and engagement and responsibility abroad. \nClosed societies suppress the liberty of their citizens, \ndraw a veil across their actions and withdraw from our \nshared international life.\n\nWe must be honest \u2014 the forces of insularity and \nisolationism have gained momentum in recent years. \nDiscrediting democracy feels easier. Authoritarian \nStates point enthusiastically at the ongoing fallout of \nthe 2008 financial crisis \u2014 proof, they say, of a broken \n\n\n\f\nWestern model. They feel vindicated; their citizens \nmay be less free, but their growth rates outstrip those \nin the West. At the same time, in many of the States \naffected by the financial crash, austerity has given rise \nto a period of introspection. The impulse is to turn \ninwards rather than face outwards.\n\nAnd so a crisis of confidence has threatened to take \nhold in parts of the developed world. It is not surprising \nto hear some argue that liberal democracy has had \nits day and that our multilateral system is becoming \nobsolete. But those who make these claims are wrong. \nThey are drawing the wrong conclusions from recent \nevents.\n\nThe real lesson of the past five years has been \nthe remarkable resilience of open societies and the \nacute need for international cooperation in today\u2019s \nworld. Liberal democracies in Europe and across the \nAtlantic have weathered profound economic difficulty. \nThe eurozone did not fall over, as many said it would. \nBy working together, disaster was averted and the \nsovereign debt crisis is being managed.\n\nIn Europe we have maintained stability at a time of \ngreat upheaval because, for the most part, our citizens \nhave expressed their frustration peacefully and through \nthe ballot box. And where there has been unrest, mature \ndemocracies have managed it with relative success. And \nso, just as the events of recent years have revealed the \nweaknesses of some Western economies, they have also \nunderscored the great strength of open societies \u2014 the \nability to evolve and adapt. Open societies do not fear \nchange, and in the twenty-first century such openness \nto reform is critical to lasting stability and success.\n\nDemocracy, free speech, participation, equality \nbefore the law, the right to peaceful protest, the right \nto be educated, the chance to work \u2014 these are not \nWestern values; they are the political and economic \nfreedoms sought by citizens everywhere, and they \nare gaining force in every country around the globe. \nGovernments that ignore them are fighting a losing \nbattle. Democracy did not fail in Egypt; a single set of \nelections failed. Egypt now needs to return to the path \nof inclusive democracy. The democratic urge remains \nas strong among the people as it was when they first \nrejoiced in Tahrir Square.\n\nIn other parts of the region, while the picture is \nmixed, important progress has been made. In Libya, the \nGeneral National Congress is working towards elections \nin early 2014. Morocco has a new Constitution and, for \nthe first time, a Prime Minister elected by Parliament. \nAlthough difficult challenges remain, Yemen has chosen \nreconciliation, dialogue and democracy over violence. \nTunisia is also focused on building a new democracy \nand economic growth, with progress towards a new \nConstitution, and further elections expected in 2014.\n\nYes, these nations will undergo more turbulence. \nThat is certain. Well-functioning democracy cannot \nemerge overnight, be exported from the West or \ndropped on a country from 8,000 feet \u2014 that much we \nhave learnt from the failures of the past. Developing \nthe culture and institutions needed \u2014 the rule of law, \nplural politics, human rights \u2014 is a painstaking process \nfor every country involved, and it requires strategic \npatience from the rest of the world.\n\nBut while the road to democracy is difficult, the \ndirection of travel is set. Everywhere we look, people \nare standing together against discrimination and for \nequality; against oppression and for liberty. A wave \nof openness has emerged, transcending borders and \ncultures. Men and women of every creed, faith and \ncolour are calling for fair opportunities and demanding \nto be heard.\n\nThe United Kingdom is clear. We are on the side of \nall those who support political freedom and economic \nempowerment. There will be no pulling up of the \ndrawbridge from us; no heading into retreat. We will \nresist any impulse to turn our back on the world.\n\nIn North Africa and the Middle East, we are \nhelping States put in place the building blocks for their \ndemocracies. Whether by training Libyan officials to \nsupervise fair elections, or supporting a free media by \ntraining journalists in Morocco, these are the nuts and \nbolts of successful democratic transition.\n\nWe are also supporting these countries\u2019 economies \nthrough our stewardship of the Group of Eight \nDeauville Partnership this year, leading efforts to boost \ntrade and investment in the region, helping small- and \nmedium-sized enterprises and, crucially, promoting \ngreater participation by women. And we have kept the \npolitical spotlight on the need to return assets stolen by \nthe former regimes in those countries.\n\nIn Syria, our priority is to help bring about a \npolitical settlement. The foundations for a settlement \nwere agreed in Geneva last year \u2014 establishing, on \nthe basis of mutual consent, a transitional governing \nbody with full executive powers. We are in close touch \nwith our partners about convening a second Geneva \n\n\n\f\nconference as soon as possible. No meaningful political \nsolution can occur without the moderate Syrian \nopposition. We recognize the Syrian National Coalition \nas the legitimate representatives of the Syrian people, \nand we recognize their commitments to the Geneva \nprocess and to building a secular, democratic and \npluralist Syria that ensures equal rights for all.\n\nOn the issue of chemical weapons in Syria, on \n21 August the Al-Assad regime committed a war \ncrime under international humanitarian law, launching \na large-scale chemical-weapon attack on its own \npeople \u2014 the first attack on this scale for 25 years and \n88 years after such weapons were universally banned. \nAs President Obama said here on Tuesday (see A/68/\nPV.5), it is an insult to human reason to suggest that \nthe regime was not responsible for that war crime. \nThe international community must react, and react \nin unison. That is why we hope to adopt later today a \nSecurity Council resolution establishing binding legal \nobligations on the Syrian regime for the removal and \ndestruction of Syria\u2019s vast chemical-weapons arsenal.\n\nOn Wednesday, I announced that the United Kingdom \nwould provide a further $160 million of humanitarian \nsupport for the Syrian people, bringing total United \nKingdom funding to $800 million \u2014 \u00a3500 million \u2014 our \nbiggest-ever response to a humanitarian crisis, much of \nwhich is aimed at helping the many children caught up \nin this tragic conflict.\n\nThe world has raised close to $1 billion of \nhumanitarian support this month, and I hope that others \nwill step up and contribute. Most importantly, I call on \nall parties inside Syria to allow humanitarian agencies \nto operate without hindrance or the threat of violence. \nUnless that urgent humanitarian access is given, no \namount of money can alleviate the scale of the Syrian \npeople\u2019s suffering.\n\nI welcome President Rouhani\u2019s comments on \nTuesday that he wants a constructive engagement \nbetween Iran and the rest of the world and that he \nwants to engage immediately in time-bound talks on \nthe nuclear issue. Those are encouraging words which I \nvery much hope are matched with genuine action. I am \npleased that negotiations on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme \nwill restart in October. If Iran\u2019s words are followed by \nconcrete steps, then there is a real opportunity to make \nprogress in resolving the serious international concerns \nabout Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. We also look to a more \nconstructive approach from Iran in helping resolve the \ncrisis in Syria, and we have made clear to Iran that we are \nready, as the United Kingdom Government, to improve \nour relationship on a step-by-step and reciprocal basis.\n\nOne thing that would fundamentally transform the \nMiddle East is a conclusive two-State agreement to end \nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict \u2014 an agreement based \non 1967 borders with agreed land swaps that leads \nto a sovereign and viable Palestinian State living in \npeace alongside a safe and secure Israel, a universally \nrecognized Palestine alongside a universally recognized \nIsrael.\n\nI commend the dedicated efforts of Secretary \nKerry and the courageous leadership of Prime Minister \nNetanyahu and President Abbas, which have enabled \ndirect peace talks to resume. I sincerely hope that both \nparties will make every effort to keep talks going, \nincluding a halt in the building of new settlements. The \ninternational community must fully support the parties \nas they make the difficult decisions that are necessary \nfor achieving a lasting peace. Britain stands ready to \nplay its part.\n\nAs we wind up our military operations in \nAfghanistan, the United Kingdom continues to work \nwith the Afghan Government to ensure a successful \ntransition. The Afghan National Security Forces are now \nleading on security and continue to grow in confidence \nand capability. That is a significant achievement. In the \nUnited Kingdom, we recognize the serious challenges \nstill ahead for Afghanistan, but we strongly believe that \nthere is room for optimism about the country\u2019s long-\nterm future. This is a crucial time for Afghan men, \nwomen and children, as they prepare for elections in \n2014, which must be credible, transparent and inclusive.\n\nPoverty is as great a threat to stability and freedom \nas are conflict and oppression. Thus, despite the strain \non our finances, the United Kingdom has met its target \nto spend 0.7 per cent of its gross national income on \ndevelopment assistance. We are the only country in \nthe Group of 20 (G-20) to have done so. Following the \nglobal economic crisis, we said we would not balance \nour books on the backs of the world\u2019s poorest and we \nhave held true to our word.\n\nOn Monday, we announced that we would provide \n$1.6 billion to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \nTuberculosis and Malaria. That is 10 per cent of the \nFund\u2019s replenishment, so long as others join.\n\nWomen and girls remain at the heart of our \ndevelopment agenda. They are the key to economic \ngrowth, so investing in girls\u2019 education is the single \n\n\n\f\nmost effective thing we can do to break the cycle of \npoverty. We must end gender inequality, which is the \nroot of violence against women. That ambition is at \nthe heart of the United Kingdom\u2019s initiative to end \nsexual violence in conflict, and I would encourage all \nStates that have yet to do so to endorse the Declaration \nof Commitment to End Sexual Violence in Conflict. \nOver 115 States are already committed; we are sending \na message to the victims of those devastating crimes \nthat they are not alone and that their attackers will be \npunished.\n\nWe have also used our presidency of the Group \nof Eight (G-8) to focus on three areas where we can \nsupport global prosperity \u2014 boosting trade, ensuring \nbetter transparency to help developing nations benefit \nfrom resources that are rightfully theirs, and cracking \ndown on tax evasion and closing tax loopholes. That \nwas just the start of our work on that agenda, and we \nare pleased that the United Kingdom\u2019s trade, tax and \ntransparency priorities have been fully reflected in \nagreements reached by the G-20, including extending \nthe commitment to resist protectionist measures by \na further two years to the end of 2016, so that trade \nremains as free and open as possible.\n\nWhether it be in the G-8, the G-20, the European \nUnion, NATO or the Commonwealth, or as one of the \nfive permanent members of the Security Council, the \nUnited Kingdom will continue to be an active and \nengaged player in the world. The biggest problems we \nface are problems we share.\n\nTake climate change, for example \u2014 the report issued \nthis morning by the United Nations Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change confirms that sea levels are \nalready rising and that ice is melting faster than we had \nexpected. The report is an authoritative rebuke to all \nthose who persist in claiming that man-made climate \nchange does not exist. The United Kingdom will \ncontinue to cut our emissions and give over $6 billion \nto assist developing countries to do the same and adapt \nto environmental changes.\n\nBut if we are to halt the devastating effects of \nclimate change, we must listen to the science, act now \nand act together. We thus welcome the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s announcement of a leaders\u2019 summit next year \nas a key step towards all nations agreeing to a deal in \n2015 to take action to avert the crisis.\n\nWe are all affected by the scourge of terrorism. \nWhether it is a soldier brutally murdered on a quiet \nLondon street or innocent shoppers gunned down in a \nbusy Nairobi mall, we are all vulnerable. Following the \nrecent horrific events in Nairobi, the United Kingdom \nis working closely with the Governments of Kenya, \nSomalia and countries across the region to tackle the \nissue. Our global response to terrorism must be robust, \nintelligent and cover all those areas where our work \ntogether can make a genuine difference. Alone we can \ntake small steps forward, but together we can take giant \nleaps.\n\nThat much was clear earlier this year when we \nsigned the world\u2019s first Arms Trade Treaty (resolution \n67/234 B) to better regulate the global sale of weapons. \nThe United Kingdom is proud of the role we played in \ndelivering it, and we urge any countries that have not \nsigned it to do so. The Treaty reminds us that, with \nenough political will, we can come together and do the \npreviously unthinkable, and that should embolden us to \ndo still more.\n\nThe United Nations has many virtues, but it also has \nserious shortcomings that must be faced. The United \nNations has no greater friend than the United Kingdom, \nbut it does not adequately reflect the world we live in \ntoday. The Security Council must be reformed. Unless \nmore room is made at the top table, it will fast become \nan anachronism, a relic of a different time. That is why \nthe United Kingdom continues to support permanent \nseats for Brazil, India, Germany and Japan, and \npermanent African representation, too. We call on all \nStates to play their part in this forum, and in our other \ninternational institutions, just as we will play ours.\n\nWe are at our best when we engage constructively \nwith one another and when we are ambitious in \npursuing our shared goals. That is as important for \nthose countries whose economies and influence have \ngrown and transformed over more recent years as it \nis for the old, established Powers. Greater influence \nmeans greater responsibility. The world is a better place \nbecause Brazil is taking a lead in tackling deforestation, \nbecause Mexico has enshrined climate-change targets \ninto law, because the Republic of Korea is leading the \nway on nuclear security.\n\nBut there is much more to do; there are many more \nareas where we need to take the lead. A global trade deal \nto cut bureaucracy at borders \u2014 the subject of a World \nTrade Organization meeting that will take place in \nBali in early December \u2014 would mean a trillion-dollar \nboost for the global economy.\n\n\n\f\nIn the next two years, the United Kingdom wants \nto do as much as it can to drive progress on the United \nNations Millennium Development Goals, and we are \nalso working in the United Nations and with civil \nsociety to set out a post-2015 agenda that is even \nmore ambitious. There can be no greater goal than to \neradicate extreme poverty, leaving no one behind.\n\nOn these and all other issues facing our nations, we \nare quite simply stronger together than we are apart. \nNow more than ever, we must fend off the forces of \ninsularity and isolationism, stand up for our values and \nlook out to the world. That is what the United Kingdom \nwill do. We stand ready to work with all others who will \ndo the same.\n"

        "file_text": "I am truly honoured to \naddress this forum. Let me convey my congratulations \nto you, Sir, on your election to preside over the General \nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. Bulgaria welcomes \nthe theme you have selected as timely and relevant and \nwishes you every success. \n\nA 16 year-old Bulgarian boy, writing a school report \non the Millennium Development Goals, compared the \nworld\u2019s development model to a colourful carpet in \nwhich some colours, threads and stitches were missing, \nmaking it look unfinished, patchy and ragged. Indeed, \nthe implementation of the Millennium Development \nGoals resembles an unfinished work. Undoubtedly, a \nlot has been achieved in the global fight against poverty \nand underdevelopment, but progress has been unsteady \nand limited. \n\nNowadays it is hard to accept that more than \n1 billion people still suffer from extreme poverty \nand malnutrition and that basic health services for \nmany women and babies remain a remote luxury. \nDisparities in wealth distribution, quality of life and \npersonal opportunities have become more extreme \nacross the globe. Climate change and environmental \ndegradation have reached an alarming level and \nrequire our urgent collective response. The well-being \nof future generations is at risk due to the irrational \nmanagement of natural resources. Despite our efforts, \nwars and armed conflicts continue to rage in different \nregions and cause thousands of deaths and are leading \nto humanitarian crises and human suffering. We also \ncontinue to witness violations of human rights and \nfundamental freedoms.\n\nThe situation in Syria continues to be a major cause \nof concern and a risk to regional and global security. \nBulgaria strongly condemns the chemical attack on \n21 August, which took the lives of thousands of innocent \npeople, including many children. The use of chemical \nweapons in Syria constitutes a blatant violation of \ninternational law, a war crime and a crime against \nhumanity. There is strong evidence to substantiate the \nassertion that the Syrian regime is responsible for those \nattacks, as it is the only party that possesses chemical \nagents, weapons and the means of their delivery for an \nattack of that scale.\n\nThere can be no impunity, and the perpetrators of \nthat heinous attack must be held accountable. Bulgaria, \nwhich is one of the signatory countries of a letter urging \nthe Security Council to immediately refer the situation \nin Syria to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal \nCourt, joins similar calls coming from the Secretary-\nGeneral and the United Nations High Commissioner for \nHuman Rights.\n\nMy country welcomes the framework agreement \nbetween the United States and the Russian Federation \nto place Syria\u2019s chemical weapons arsenal under \ninternational control with a view to its swift and \nsecure destruction, and joins them in demanding that \nthe Syrian regime provide the Organization for the \nProhibition of Chemical Weapons with immediate \naccess to inspect any and all sites in Syria. We call on \nthe Security Council to unite and shoulder its relevant \nresponsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations, \nincluding Chapter VII.\n\nThe use of chemical weapons should not divert \nattention from the persistent gross violations of human \nrights and continued human suffering. The momentum \ncreated should be used to move towards a lasting \npolitical solution to the conflict through the resumption \nof the Geneva process, with the active involvement of \nthe United Nations.\n\nThe worsening humanitarian crisis requires joint \ncoordinated action to alleviate the suffering and help \nthose in need. Bulgaria has provided humanitarian \nassistance to ease the plight of refugees in neighbouring \ncountries. Situated not far from the region, my country \n\n\n\f\nis also affected by the daily influx of refugees from \nSyria. Despite its financial constraints, the Government \nhas adopted an emergency plan and has provided \nadditional resources in order to guarantee adequate \nassistance, accommodation and services to Syrian \nrefugees. We count on the assistance and help provided \nby our partners and the humanitarian bodies of the \nUnited Nations system.\n\nWe expect that Iran will demonstrate clear political \nwill and address the concerns of the international \ncommunity by providing credible evidence of the \npeaceful nature of its nuclear programme. In that \nrespect, Iran\u2019s full cooperation with the International \nAtomic Energy Agency is of paramount importance. The \nGovernment in Tehran must show greater transparency \nin its nuclear activities and should fully comply with all \nthe relevant Security Council resolutions.\n\nBulgaria welcomes the successful adoption of the \nArms Trade Treaty to regulate the international trade in \nconventional weapons, and looks forward to its prompt \nentry into force.\n\nMy country is encouraged by the resumption of \nthe direct peace talks between the Government of \nIsrael and the Palestinian Authority at the initiative of \nSecretary Kerry, the Quartet and the parties concerned. \nWe expect both sides to demonstrate perseverance and \ncommitment to a peaceful solution, to respect each \nother\u2019s legitimate interests and to refrain from unilateral \nactions that could undermine the process. Negotiations \nare the best way forward towards the ultimate goal, \nnamely, a just, comprehensive and lasting solution on \nthe basis of the two-State formula.\n\nBulgaria welcomes the appointment of former \nMinister for Foreign Affairs Nickolay Mladenov as \nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General and \nthe Head of the United Nations Assistance Mission for \nIraq. His mission in Iraq is an important contribution \nto the peacebuilding and restoration process in that \nfriendly country and to the stability of the region as a \nwhole.\n\nBulgaria condemns terrorism as one of the most \nhorrific crimes and challenging threats to international \npeace and security. Terrorism has no face, no name, no \ncolour and no religion. It strikes unexpectedly and scars \nthe lives of everyone it touches. Recently, terrorism \nstruck again in Nairobi. On behalf of Bulgaria, I \nconvey my deepest condolences to the people and the \nGovernment of Kenya, but also Iraq, Pakistan and other \ncountries where deadly terrorist attacks have occurred.\n\nOn 18 July 2012, a terrorist attack claimed six \ninnocent lives at a Bulgarian airport. That incident \nchanged Bulgaria forever and is a reminder that the \nfight against terrorism is a common cause, on which \nthe entire international community must remain united. \nWe believe that the perpetrator of that horrendous \nterrorist act will be brought to justice soon. Bulgaria is \ngrateful for the moral support, solidarity and practical \nassistance of other Member States in the investigation \nof that horrific crime. The critical role of international \ncooperation in this area once again points to the \nnecessity of a prompt finalization of the negotiations on \na draft comprehensive convention to combat terrorism.\n\nLet us take a look at what Europe has achieved in \nthe past century. From a continent in ruins, torn apart \nby wars, we, Europeans, have created an area of peace, \nsecurity and prosperity. Enemies have become friends \nand allies, united for a better future for their children. \nToday, in the European Union, we have harmonized \nregulations and share a single market, all underpinned \nby our common values.\n\nThe past 25 years in the history of the Balkans are \nanother great example of what can be achieved when \nneighbours work together towards a common goal. \nBuilding trust, good neighbourly relations, stability \nand security in South-Eastern Europe and in the Black \nSea region is among Bulgaria\u2019s priorities. My country \nremains strongly committed and will continue to \nsupport the efforts of our partners from the Western \nBalkans to meet the European Union membership \ncriteria and take their legitimate place in the united \nEuropean family.\n\nThe European Neighbourhood Policy remains one \nof the most efficient instruments of the European Union \nto deepen cooperation and ensure peace and stability \nin the broader region. Bulgaria attaches particular \nimportance to the Eastern dimension of the Policy \nto enhance relations with countries of the Black Sea \nregion and members of the Eastern Partnership.\n\nIf common borders and geographical proximity \nmake us neighbours, shared cultural heritage is what \nmakes us a family. This year we, the Slavic nations, \ncelebrate together the one thousandth one hundred and \nfiftieth anniversary of the mission of the holy brothers \nCyril and Methodius to Great Moravia. Almost \n12 centuries ago, they bestowed upon us the invaluable \n\n\n\f\ngift of the first Slavic alphabet. Bulgaria welcomed the \ndisciples Saint Cyril and Methodius and adopted the \nCyrillic script, which has helped us to preserve our \nnational identity over the centuries.\n\nThis year the international community marks \nthe twentieth anniversary of the Vienna Declaration \nand Programme of Action on human rights. On this \noccasion, Bulgaria would like to emphasize its strong \nconviction that human rights should remain one of \nthe foremost priorities for the United Nations. As a \ncandidate for membership in the Human Rights Council \nfor the period 2019-2021, Bulgaria will intensify its \nefforts in promoting the highest human rights standards \nboth domestically and internationally. \n\nWe welcome the convening of the High-level \nMeeting on the Realization of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and Other Internationally Agreed \nDevelopment Goals for Persons with Disabilities. As \na party to the Convention on the Rights of Persons \nwith Disabilities and as a member of the bureau of the \nConference of States Parties to the Convention in New \nYork, my country is strongly engaged in promoting \nthe comprehensive and consistent implementation of \nthe Convention at all levels, including by engaging \ndisabled people\u2019s organizations as an important partner \nin disability-inclusive development.\n\nMy country is convinced that the course of \nreforms of the United Nations should continue in \norder to enhance the efficiency, representativeness and \ntransparency of the entire United Nations system. To \nmeet the needs of a changing world, the United Nations \nshould continuously adapt and improve. That includes \na revitalized General Assembly, a strengthened \nEconomic and Social Council and a Security Council \nthat reflects contemporary realities. As member of the \nEastern European regional group, Bulgaria continues to \nhold its position as to the need for allotting at least one \nadditional non-permanent seat in an enlarged Security \nCouncil to the group, given the fact that, in the past \n20 years, its membership has more than doubled.\n\nBased on our long-standing engagement with the \nprinciples and values of the United Nations, I pledge \nthat Bulgaria will be a responsible and reliable partner \nshould it be elected as a Security Council non-permanent \nmember for the term 2018-2019. We hope that the \nMembers of the United Nations will entrust Bulgaria \nwith that responsibility, and we stand ready to shoulder \nit in a spirit of partnership.\n\nWe are still a long way from the future we \nwant. The Rio de Janeiro Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment outlined a comprehensive agenda for \nfurther work to be completed in the three dimensions of \nsustainable development. The recently published report \nof the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-\n2015 Development Agenda presents key proposals for \ntransformative shifts and a global, people-centred and \nplanet-sensitive agenda. Bulgaria is actively engaged \nin the negotiation process on the new sustainable \ndevelopment goals, with a view to achieving a post-2015 \nframework that is human rights-driven, builds upon the \nachievements of the Millennium Development Goals \nand integrates poverty eradication and sustainable \ndevelopment in a single and coherent process.\n\nThe new universal and legally binding climate \nagreement to be signed in 2015 should reinforce the \noverarching post-2015 development agenda and speed \nup the international community\u2019s efforts to introduce \nnew sustainable models for growth.\n\nCulture and education should be accorded their \nrightful place in the post-2015 development agenda. In \nthat regard, UNESCO\u2019s role is of pivotal importance. \nLet me take this opportunity to reiterate Bulgaria\u2019s \nstrong support for the re-election of Ms. Irina Bokova \nto a second term as Director-General.\n\nI would like also to express Bulgaria\u2019s admiration \nfor the work done by UNICEF in the service of the \nchildren of the world. Bulgaria highly values the \npartnership and policy advice provided by the UNICEF \nOffice in Sofia and others worldwide in modernizing \nthe national child-protection sector and achieving more \nequitable and inclusive child care.\n\nToday we are building the world of tomorrow. \nYoung people should be at the heart of those efforts \nas active participants, not as bystanders. For Bulgaria, \nyoung people are key stakeholders in the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda.\n\nThis year Bulgaria commemorates the seventieth \nanniversary of the rescue of Bulgarian Jews from the \ndeath camps during the Second World War, a unique \nachievement of Bulgarian civil society. Unfortunately, \nour country was in a situation where it could not do \nthe same for Jews from northern Greece and parts of \nYugoslavia. We deeply mourn their loss as well as that \nof all the victims of the Holocaust.\n\nRecently, citizens from different parts of the world, \nBulgaria included, have engaged actively in public \n\n\n\f\nlife, demanding greater transparency, accountability, \ndecency and integrity from their politicians. We in my \ncountry believe that this renewed energy on the part of \ncivil society deserves to be encouraged and supported. \nI firmly believe that safeguarding human dignity is the \nultimate goal of the United Nations, as, indeed, of any \ngenuine democracy.\n\n"

        "file_text": "I would like to begin \nmy statement by congratulating Ambassador John \nWilliam Ashe on his election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. I would also like to \nextend our congratulations to his country, Antigua and \nBarbuda, which is honoured by the selection of one of \nits sons to preside this year over the most representative \nworld institution. \n\nThe President carries on his shoulders the \nresponsibility for guiding the work of the current session \nof the General Assembly at a time that all consider to be \npolitically very critical for the international community. \nIndeed, the reality that the international community \nfaces today is that of a world troubled by dangerous \nglobal geopolitical tensions and an international \nfinancial and economic crisis that is deeper and wider \nthan any we have seen since the 1930s. The intensity \nof the crisis has thrown millions of people onto the \nunemployment rolls and created millions of new poor \nthroughout the world. \n\nThere are new fears, new dangers and new threats \naround the world \u2014 from transnational terrorism \nto arms and drug trafficking as well as frightening \ninterfaith tensions that often result in bloodshed. Other \ndangers include the return of brutal, old-style piracy \nto the modern age, not only off the coast of Somalia \nbut also in the Gulf of Guinea, threatening important \nroutes through which oil is transported to fuel the world \neconomy, creating insecurity for the international \nmerchant marine and facilitating illicit fishing and \nall manner of illegal maritime trafficking in arms, \nhuman beings and psychotropic substances; persistent \noutbreaks of ethnic violence that cause enormous \nhuman suffering; and unimaginable humanitarian \ndisasters in various areas.\n\nI come from a small country on the westernmost tip \nof the African coast. We are a poor country, but we have \nnot lost the hope of achieving, in peace, the progress \nto which we are entitled. Two days ago we celebrated \nthe fortieth anniversary of our national independence, \nso this is a good time for us to reaffirm the following: \nduring the entire period of armed struggle for national \nliberation, the people that I represent believed in the \nUnited Nations and in international law, and my country \n\n\n\f\ntoday reiterates, maintains and further reinforces that \nbelief.\n\nWe achieved national independence in 1973. It was \nnot given to us by anybody but became possible only \nas a result of the international solidarity of some and, \nultimately, the recognition of all. \n\nTo all without exception, I wish, on behalf of Guinea-\nBissau, to express our feeling of eternal gratitude, to \ndeclare our firm desire to strengthen longstanding ties \nof friendship and to affirm our willingness, despite \nall that has transpired, to rebuild the foundations of \nsolidarity that united our peoples in the past.\n\nFrom this rostrum I ask for the Assembly\u2019s patience \nand understanding and hope for its solidarity. I believe \nthat expressions of generosity are in no way inconsistent \nwith the cold rationality of relations among sovereign \nStates. I am the Interim President of the Republic of \nGuinea-Bissau, and that title, as the Assembly is well \naware, indicates something particular and exceptional.\n\nIndeed, the political and military events of 12 April \n2012 created a new political environment in my country. \nA military coup had ousted the interim President of the \nRepublic and a self-suspended Prime Minister who \nhad launched an inconclusive campaign to run for the \npresidency. Faced with that situation, we wondered \nwhat to do.\n\nFortunately, the best option available at the time, in \nour opinion, ultimately prevailed. We were able to avoid \npolitical problems that, had they taken hold, could have \nthrown the country into a political and military tailspin \nwith consequences that would have been unpredictable \nand certainly much graver than those we nonetheless \nhad to face and, in some ways, continue to face.\n\nWe therefore had to circumscribe the dynamics of \nthe military coup, control its political effects and limit \nits institutional reach, and, as if that were not enough, \nwe had to deal with two opposing positions that emerged \nboth internally and abroad.\n\nOne of them was deeply detrimental to the peaceful \nreturn to constitutional normality in my country, but \nthe other was much more realistic and thus more \npromising in terms of the gradual re-establishment \nof constitutional order. We had to deal with the first \nso-called position, which was both curious and \ndramatic. That position was taken by people who \nwould have preferred to see the worst possible situation \nin Guinea-Bissau. Why? They were betting on the \ndegradation of the political situation in my country in \norder to justify their views, confirm their predictions \nand operationalize their political concepts of how to \nresolve the crisis in Guinea-Bissau. Indeed, they made \nevery attempt to apply the formula of \u201cthe worse for \nGuinea-Bissau, the better\u201d \u2014 the better to serve their \nown interests. With such a radical position, they were \ntruly able to touch the deepest sensibilities of a people \nthat is humble but refuses to be humiliated.\n\nWe are a true democracy, notwithstanding all our \nflaws, the violations of the democratic purpose of the \nState and the many detours taken. We are the first to \nrecognize that. But we must not forget that we are, first, \na State born out of centuries of pain and hope and of a \nhard and victorious struggle for national independence, \nwhich has had a strong influence on the determination \nof the political values to be defended.\n\nIn order to enable the second option on the table \nto go forward, we were able to rely on the realism \nand prompt solidarity of the Economic Community of \nWest African States (ECOWAS). With the important \nsupport of the Security Council, ECOWAS became \nsolely responsible for managing the agreed transition \nperiod and created a reduced stabilization military \nmission that became known as the ECOWAS Mission \nin Guinea-Bissau.\n\nAt the political and institutional levels, the \nparliament elected by the people of Guinea-Bissau \u2014 the \nNational People\u2019s Assembly \u2014 remained standing and \nthus was able to provide the political transition with a \nlegitimate and legitimizing institutional basis. In fact, \nthe Constitution of the Republic was never suspended.\n\nThat is the origin of the office of the Interim \nPresident of the Republic. It did not come from a military \ncoup. It came, rather, from an elected Parliament and \ntherefore from a political and institutional process. \nThat makes all the difference.\n\n\nI combined the position of Member of Parliament, \nelected to the position four times in a row, with that \nof First Vice-President of that body of sovereignty: in \nother words, all modesty aside, I am a democrat with a \nmature conviction and never carried out a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat or \nordered any such action.\n\nIndeed, with the inauguration of the Interim \nPresident of the Republic, the political transition process \n\n\n\f\nper se began. After some time, Parliament approved the \nrevised transition pact and the corresponding political \nagreement. Later on it approved the programme \nand general budget for the State, submitted by a \nGovernment with a broad political base, which I, as \nInterim President of the Republic, had appointed and \ninstalled by presidential decree.\n\nWith those steps, the political transition truly \ntook off. I have signed a presidential decree setting \n24 November as the date for the legislative and \npresidential elections. What remains, which is no small \ntask, is to ensure the availability of funds to carry out \nan effective, transparent and unquestionable electoral \nprocess. To that end, we must create reliable voter \nregistries, something that can be accomplished only \nthrough an accurate census or voter registration process. \nThat is where the political transition in Guinea-Bissau \nstands.\n\nGuinea-Bissau is the victim of two dramatically \ninterlinked evils: poverty and political instability. In \na society such as that of my country, poverty creates \na propensity for political instability. In turn, political \ninstability has an impact on the economic order, \nreduces the rate of growth and thus increases the \npoverty rate. The challenge ahead consists precisely \nof escaping the two traps of poverty and political \ninstability. Overcoming this challenge obviously goes \nwell beyond the goals for this exceptional period of \npolitical transition. Therefore, in that regard, we will \nnot go into further detail. \n\nIn the light of this enormous economic and political \nliability, which has yet to be resolved, achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals within a given time \nframe is truly beyond our means, for the foreseeable \nfuture at least. But this recognition does not mean that \nthe Government, civil society and Guinea-Bissau\u2019s \nbilateral and multilateral development partners \nin general, including United Nations specialized \nagencies, have given up on the effort. On the contrary, \nin education, health, gender-equality policies, the fight \nagainst poverty, environmental policies for sustainable \ndevelopment, and other areas, our country has made \nprogress, though moderate and below satisfactory \nlevels.\n\nWith respect to the outcome document of the United \nNations Conference on Sustainable Development, \nentitled \u201cThe future we want\u201d (resolution 66/288, \nannex), Guinea-Bissau will make every effort to carry \nout the commitments undertaken. We hope that the more \ndeveloped countries, our partners, will do their part in \nthe fight against poverty, one of the greatest scourges \nafflicting States such as Guinea-Bissau, which are very \nfragile and therefore very vulnerable, and still suffering \nfrom the grave consequences of armed conflict.\n\nGuinea-Bissau supports the establishment on \n24 September of the High-level Political Forum on \nSustainable Development. It replaces the Commission \non Sustainable Development and will develop the \nUnited Nations post-2015 development agenda. As a \ncountry of many islands, Guinea-Bissau welcomes the \nSecretary-General\u2019s initiative to convene the Third \nInternational Conference on Small Island Developing \nStates, in Samoa, in September 2014.\n\nWe take this opportunity to thank the United \nNations, and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in \nparticular, for their dedication to our country and for \nappointing former President of Timor-Leste Jos\u00e9 Ramos-\nHorta as United Nations Special Representative and \nHead of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding \nOffice in Guinea-Bissau. Mr. Ramos-Horta has made \nexcellent contributions to the political normalization of \nour country. \n\nThe State of Guinea-Bissau is not oblivious to the \nevolution of the international political environment. \nGuinea-Bissau has never been indifferent to the hopes \nand suffering of people all over the world. In that \nregard, we stand firm in solidarity with our brothers \nin ECOWAS. We wish the people of Mali the best of \nluck. Mali has just demonstrated its immense maturity \nby going to the polls during recent general elections \nwith civic pride, marking the end of a period of political \ntransition. That also sent a strong starting signal \nfor national reconciliation and efforts to rebuild the \ncountry, which was destroyed by acts of terrorism and \nunacceptable irredentism. We take this opportunity to \ncongratulate France on its crucial role in safeguarding \nthe integrity of Malian territory, which is the foundation \nof the country\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nWe repudiate the terrorist attacks that have taken \nplace in Nigeria and Kenya, spurred by radicalism in \nthe name of religious intolerance. We offer our full \nsupport to the sister nations of Nigeria and Kenya, \nPresidents Goodluck Jonathan and Uhuru Kenyatta, \ntheir Governments and the families of all the victims. \nWe hope that neighbouring Guinea undergoes a \nsuccessful electoral process, paving the path for true \nnational reconciliation in that country. \n\n\n\f\nIn Egypt and Syria, which has been ravaged by \nwar, we hope that dialogue and diplomacy prevail over \nforce, so that we can avoid sacrificing more human \nlives. In the Middle East, we continue to defend the \nPalestinian cause with as much conviction as ever. It is \ncrucial for the Palestinian people in particular, and for \npolitical stability and peacebuilding in the Arab world \nin general, that negotiations between the Palestinian \nauthorities and the State of Israel advance towards the \ncreation of a sovereign Palestinian State, in accordance \nwith the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.\n\nAs to Europe, we offer a special word of recognition \nto France, which has never abandoned us and continues \nvery actively to seek better ways of helping Guinea-\nBissau overcome a political crisis. We also thank the \nKingdom of Spain, whose Ambassador to the United \nNations has been instrumental in efforts towards \npolitical normalization. Our friend Timor-Leste, a small \ncountry within the Community of Portuguese-Speaking \nCountries (CPLP), has exhibited an admirable spirit of \ncooperation with Guinea-Bissau, demonstrating that \nfriends do come through in the most difficult of times. \nThe Timorese authorities have understood the very \nsimple fact that supporting an institutional process of \npolitical normalization is not the same as supporting a \ncoup d\u2019\u00e9tat. It is, indeed, quite the contrary. \n\nWe very much thank President Armando \nGuebuza, current President of the CPLP, for his fair \nassessment of the political process in Guinea-Bissau, \nfor his encouragement and for appealing to the \ninternational community to provide financial support \nfor general elections in Guinea-Bissau. We also take \nthis opportunity to congratulate Murade Murargy, \na Mozambican national who currently serves as the \nExecutive Secretary of CPLP, for his dedication to \nthe political normalization process in our country. We \nhope one day, and perhaps one day soon, to see a full \nnormalization of our relations with the countries of the \nCPLP, which is in the interests of all our peoples and \nsovereign States. \n\nWith respect to Cuba, we call, as we have always \ndone, for an end to the decades-long embargo and \nfor the advancement of the reforms under way in that \nfriendly nation, with which we have so many and such \ndeep ties of friendship and solidarity.\n\nWith respect to Asia, we wish to express our \nprofound gratitude to the People\u2019s Republic of China \nfor the extent and intensity of its cooperation with our \ncountry. The fruits of this cooperation, particularly \nin the construction of key public buildings, will enter \nhistory as indelible symbols of a friendship that dates \nback to our armed struggle for national liberation. \n\nWe express the profound gratitude of the people of \nGuinea-Bissau to Mr. Alassane Ouattara, President of \nthe Republic of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and current President of \nECOWAS, and to Mr. Goodluck Jonathan, President \nof the Federal Republic of Nigeria and President of \nthe International Contact Group on Guinea-Bissau, as \nwell as to all the Heads of State and Government of the \nmember countries of ECOWAS.\n"

        "file_text": "This \nyear has been an unusual one in China\u2019s development. \nChina\u2019s new central collective leadership has put \nforward the concept of the \u201cChinese dream\u201d, a dream of \nthe great renewal of the Chinese nation, and it is leading \nthe 1.3 billion Chinese people in an endeavour to fulfil \nthe two centennial goals, namely, to finish building a \nmoderately prosperous society in all respects by 2020 \nand to turn China into a modern socialist country by \nthe mid-twenty-first century. Having experienced \nprofound changes in the past 5,000 years and especially \nthe past century, China has reached a new historical \nstarting point today.\n\nWhat development path will China take in the \nfuture? What domestic and foreign policies will it \npursue? And what kind of international role will it play? \nI understand that those questions are of great interest to \nthe international community. As the Foreign Minister \nof the new Chinese Government, I wish to give an \nemphatic answer to each of them.\n\nChina will stay firmly on the path of peaceful \ndevelopment. China\u2019s rapid development over the years \nhas given rise to worries that China might follow the \nold pattern of wealth breeding arrogance and strength \nleading to hegemony, and various versions of the China \nthreat theory have surfaced. However, what happened \nin the past should not be applied to today\u2019s China.\n\nThe outdated Cold War mentality has no place \nin the new era of globalization. The Chinese nation \nloves peace and the Chinese culture values harmony. \nThroughout history, the Chinese people have always \nembraced international exchanges and trade, not \nforeign aggression and expansion, and have adhered to \nthe patriotic resolve to defend the homeland rather than \nthe colonialist doctrine of seizing new territories.\n\nThe culture of a country determines its values, \nand its history points the way to its future. Close to 40 \nyears ago, it was from this rsotrum that the Chinese \nleader Deng Xiaoping solemnly declared on behalf of \nthe Chinese Government that China would never seek \nhegemony in the world. Today, his statement remains \nour unchanging commitment and conviction. China has \nhonoured and will continue to honour its promise and \nremain a staunch force for upholding world peace.\n\nChina pursues peaceful development and calls \non all other countries to follow the same path. Since \nthe beginning of reform and opening up, China has \nbecome increasingly interdependent with the global \neconomy and integrated into the international system. \nWe are committed to working with others to establish \na new type of international relations, based on win-win \ncooperation, and to seek the peaceful resolution of \ninternational and regional disputes. With regard to \nChina\u2019s disputes with some countries over territorial \nsovereignty and maritime rights and interests, we \nsincerely hope to resolve them in accordance with \nproper procedures, through negotiation and consultation \nwith the countries directly involved. Those disputes \nthat cannot be resolved now can be shelved for future \nresolution. That is our consistent position and practice. \nOn the other hand, we will, whatever the circumstances, \nfirmly safeguard China\u2019s sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity and resolutely uphold China\u2019s legitimate and \nlawful rights and interests.\n\n\n\f\nChina will remain committed to reform, to opening \nup and to sustainable development. It has been five \nyears since the outbreak of the international financial \ncrisis. The global economy is back on the right track \nto recovery, but the foundations of the recovery are not \nsolid and the speed is not fast enough. The root causes \nof the financial crisis have yet to be removed, and the \nstructural problems of developed countries remain \nunresolved. The adjustment of unconventional monetary \npolicies from the outside, coupled with other factors, \nhave posed new challenges and the risk of financial \nmarket volatility to emerging market countries.\n\nWhere the Chinese economy is heading engages \nboth domestic and international attention. In that \nregard, I wish to inform the Assembly that both the \nfundamentals and the overall performance of China\u2019s \neconomy are sound, and China\u2019s development prospects \nare bright. The leading indicators of the Chinese \neconomy are generally good, and China leads the major \neconomies in growth rate.\n\nIn pursuit of progress while maintaining stability, \nthe Chinese Government has followed a macroeconomic \npolicy that addresses both immediate and long-term \nneeds and has adopted a series of innovative policy \nmeasures with a view to promoing steady growth, \neconomic structural adjustment and reform. We are \nvigorously pursuing reform, opening up, deepening \neconomic structural adjustment and accelerating \nthe shift in our growth model. We are implementing \nthe basic State policy of resource conservation and \nenvironmental protection and promoting green, \ncircular and low-carbon development to build a sound \necological environment and a beautiful China.\n\nWith its increasing economic output and its \nchanging growth model, China\u2019s economy has entered \na phase of high-to-medium growth rate. That is \ndictated by the law of economics, and it will ensure \nthe sustained and healthy growth of the Chinese \neconomy. The Chinese economy is being upgraded, \nand its future growth will deliver major dividends in \nfour areas as a result of industrialization, information \ntechnology application, a new type of urbanization and \nagricultural modernization; reform and innovation; \nstructural readjustment; and further opening up. It is \nprojected that in the coming five years, China\u2019s imports \nof commodities will exceed $10 trillion, its overseas \ninvestment will reach $500 billion, and Chinese \ntourists will make over 400 million outbound visits. \nThat will give stronger impetus to the world economy \nand bring an increasing number of tangible benefits to \nother countries.\n\nChina will firmly promote reform of the global \ngovernance system with the United Nations at its core. \nThe United Nations is a big stage for all countries to \nconduct consultation and cooperation with one another. \nIt is also a big family where people of all countries are \nbrought together. It is our consistent position that the \npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United \nNations form the cornerstone of current international \nrelations and provide safeguards for world peace and \nstability. Respecting national sovereignty and opposing \ninterference in internal affairs, safeguarding peace \nand opposing aggression, and promoting equality and \nopposing power politics; those are important principles \nthat must be observed. China firmly upholds the role \nand authority of the United Nations, supports the United \nNations in its renewal and self-improvement efforts, in \nkeeping with a changing world, and looks forward to a \nUnited Nations that plays a larger role in international \naffairs. China is ready to deepen cooperation with \nthe United Nations and get more actively involved in \nUnited Nations activities in various fields.\n\nChina is committed to promoting democracy \nin international relations and the trend toward a \nmultipolar world. We call for a greater representation \nand voice for developing countries in the global \ngovernance system and support the Group of 20, the \nBRICS group \u2014 Brazil, Russia, India, China and South \nAfrica \u2014 and other emerging mechanisms that are \nplaying a key role in making the international order \nfairer and more equitable. We also call for the reform \nof the international monetary and financial systems and \nwant the role of the World Trade Organization as the \nmain forum in the area of trade to be maintained. We \nare opposed to trade protectionism and are working to \nmake economic globalization more balanced, inclusive \nand beneficial to all. We call on countries to enhance \nmacroeconomic policy coordination and be mindful \nof the spillover effects of their respective adjustment \nof economic policies. We call for the strengthening of \nNorth-South dialogue and South-South cooperation to \nmake development benefits more accessible to people \nof all countries.\n\nChina will firmly fulfil its international \nresponsibilities and obligations. The Chinese nation \nis responsible and ready to play its part. Although it \nremains a developing country facing the daunting task \nof development, China, as the second-largest economy \n\n\n\f\nand a permanent member of the Security Council, is \nfully aware of its responsibilities and the expectations \nplaced on it by the international community. We will be \nfully and more actively engaged in international affairs \nand work closely with other countries to meet complex \nglobal challenges and tackle the difficult issues facing \nhumankind. We will voice China\u2019s views, offer China\u2019s \nwisdom, propose China\u2019s solutions, play China\u2019s due \nrole and provide more public goods to the international \ncommunity.\n\nWe will vigorously advocate the right vision on \njustice versus special interests, and we will endeavour \nto build a community of common destiny with other \ndeveloping countries. In our exchanges and cooperation \nwith other developing countries, we will uphold justice \nand place it above special interests. We will provide \nassistance to other developing countries to the best \nof our ability, so as to enable developing countries to \nrealize independent and sustainable development.\n\nWe will play a more proactive and constructive role \nin addressing international and regional hotspot issues \nto promote peace and dialogue, defuse conflicts and \nsafeguard world peace and stability. We will maintain \nour escort missions and counter-piracy operations in the \nGulf of Aden and increase our participation in United \nNations peacekeeping operations so as to contribute \nmore to peace and security in Africa and other relevant \nregions.\n\nThe turmoil in Syria has lasted for nearly three \nyears, causing great suffering and trauma to both the \nSyrian people and Syria\u2019s neighbours. The recent use of \nchemical weapons has met with universal condemnation. \nChina firmly opposes the use of chemical weapons. \nWe hope to see the early adoption of a Security \nCouncil resolution to support the Organization for the \nProhibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in launching \nthe verification and destruction of chemical weapons, \nand we stand ready to make financial contributions to \nthe OPCW for the destruction of chemical weapons in \nSyria and to send experts to work there on the ground.\n\nChina calls for an immediate end to hostilities and \nviolence in Syria so that the necessary conditions for \nthe verification and destruction of chemical weapons \ncan be created. We call for the early convening of \nthe \u201cGeneva II\u201d conference and faster progress on a \npolitical resolution of the Syrian issue. China seeks \nno gains for itself in Syria. We respect the aspirations \nand choice of the Syrian people. China is following the \nhumanitarian situation in Syria with great concern. We \nhave provided and will continue to provide assistance \nwithin our means to the Syrian people, including Syrian \nrefugees outside the country.\n\nRecently, China has been providing emergency \nhumanitarian aid to Jordan in the amount of \u00a515 million, \nand has provided emergency humanitarian aid in cash \nworth \u00a524 million to the World Food Programme and the \nWorld Health Organization for displaced people within \nSyria and Syrian refugees in Lebanon, respectively.\n\nChina has been working to promote a peaceful \nsettlement to the Iranian nuclear issue through \ndialogue. We have played a constructive role in \nseeking a comprehensive, lasting and appropriate \nsolution to the Iranian nuclear issue so as to uphold the \ninternational non-proliferation regime and peace and \nstability in the Middle East. The dialogue between Iran \nand the permanent members of the Security Council \nand Germany has created new opportunities. All the \nrelevant parties should scale up diplomatic efforts and \nwork for substantive progress in the dialogue at an early \ndate.\n\nThe Palestinian issue is at the core of the Middle \nEast conflict. Guided by President Xi Jinping\u2019s four-\npoint proposal on resolving the Palestinian issue, China \nwill continue to work for a comprehensive, just and \ndurable solution to the issue.\n\nThanks to the concerted efforts of all the relevant \nparties, tensions on the Korean peninsula are easing. \nAchieving the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula \nand maintaining long-term peace and stability on the \npeninsula will respond to the common interests of all \nparties concerned. It is China\u2019s consistent position that \na negotiated solution through dialogue is the right way \nto resolve the nuclear issue on the peninsula, and the \nSix-Party Talks are an effective platform to promote \ndenuclearization on the Korean peninsula. This year \nmarks the tenth anniversary of the launch of the Six-\nParty Talks. We hope that all parties will create \nconducive conditions, build consensus, work towards \nthe same goal and resume the talks at an early date.\n\nInternational development cooperation is at a crucial \nstage, where we must build on past achievements to \nmake new progress. China supports the continued and \nfull implementation of the Millennium Development \nGoals and the early launch of intergovernmental \nnegotiations on the post-2015 development agenda. The \npost-2015 development agenda should continue to focus \non development and poverty elimination, give due \n\n\n\f\nconsideration to national conditions and the various \nstages of development in the different countries, and \nrespect their independent choice of development path. \nThe agenda should give priority to strengthening global \ndevelopment partnerships; adhere to the principles of \ncommon but differentiated responsibilities, equity and \nrespective capabilities; improve follow-up mechanisms; \nstep up development financing; promote trade and \ninvestment liberalization and facilitation; and increase \nofficial development aid and technical support to \ndeveloping countries.\n\nChina welcomes the positive outcomes of the \nUnited Nations Climate Change Conference held in \nDoha in late 2012. China hopes that the developed \ncountries will demonstrate political will and honour \ntheir commitments by scaling up emissions-reduction \nefforts and providing capital, technology and capacity-\nbuilding support to developing countries. The Chinese \nGovernment takes climate change seriously, and the \nmany forceful policy measures it has taken have resulted \nin notable progress. China will continue to play its due \nrole in addressing global climate change.\n\nTime flies. We will soon be celebrating the \nseventieth anniversary of the founding of the United \nNations. Born out of the ashes of the Second World War, \nthe United Nations embodies the yearning of the peoples \nof all countries for world peace and global development. \nThe Chinese dream is a dream of prosperity for the \ncountry and happiness for the people; it has much in \ncommon with the dream of people across the world. As \na responsible Member of the United Nations, China is \nready to work with all other Member States to faithfully \nadhere to the purposes of the Charter of the United \nNations, faithfully carry out its historic mission and \ncontinue to make relentless efforts to advance the noble \ncause of peace and development for humankind.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a pleasure to begin this address with warm \ncongratulations to Ambassador John Ashe on his recent \nelection as President of the General Assembly. We wish \nhim success in his endeavours and assure him of our \nsupport.\n\nToday is the last time that I will address the \nGeneral Assembly as President of Costa Rica. As on \nprevious occasions, my message is based upon my firm \nconviction of the essential nature of the United Nations \nto promote peace, security, development, democracy \nand human rights. The United Nations brings together, \ncatalyses and protects the multilateral system and the \ninternational rule of law. Its validity, vigour, legitimacy \nand effectiveness are essential to all countries, but most \nimportantly to the smaller and more vulnerable ones, \nespecially if, like Costa Rica, they do not have armed \nforces. In the course of humankind\u2019s most challenging \ntimes throughout the past 68 years, we have turned to the \nOrganization to seek guidance and solutions responsive \nto the hopes and longings of our peoples. Today, we \nare facing one such occasion, amid contradictions. \nWe are the authors of great achievements, but we are \nalso overwhelmed by acute tragedies. There remain \nserious global challenges for which we have not crafted \nresponses that are equally global in scope.\n\nOn 2 April, we conclusively ratified the Arms Trade \nTreaty, a vital step that was proudly led by our country \nas one of the seven sponsoring countries, and a great \nvictory for humankind. I am pleased to announce today \nthat it has been unanimously ratified by the Legislative \nAssembly of Costa Rica, and I pledge our support to \nwork assidiously for its implementation. \n\n\n\nIn two days, for the first time in the history of \nthe Organization, we will hold a high-level debate on \nnuclear disarmament. Costa Rica will also lend its \nleadership on the issue. In that way, we hope to be able \nto move closer towards an ideal aspired to by most \ncountries and to make progress in new conceptual \nframeworks for discussion. The meetings of the Open-\nended Working Group on Nuclear Disarmament, chaired \n\nwith effectiveness by our Permanent Representative in \nGeneva, Mr. Manuel Dengo Benavides, have opened up \na promising path.\n\nWe are working at a good rate to establish a new \nglobal agenda for sustainable development, as well \nas institutions to promote it. That is evidenced by \nthe reform of the Economic and Social Council, the \nestablishment of the High-level Political Forum on \nSustainable Development and the progress being \nmade on the Open Working Group on Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals. \n\nIncreasingly, innovation, technology, education and \nculture are recognized as promoters of development, \nand there is a growing awareness of the need to actively \nincorporate young people in such endeavours. Together \nwith the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), \nCosta Rica is honoured to have hosted and organized \nBYND 2015 Global Youth Summit, an international \nconference on youth, development and information and \ncommunication technologies. The conference brought \ntogether young people from various parts of the world \nand enjoyed the able leadership from the ITU Secretary \nGeneral, Mr. Hamadoun Tour\u00e9. Today, I symbolically \npresent to the General Assembly the final declaration of \nthe conference, adopted in our capital on 11 September \nby thousands of young people from every continent. \nWe trust that it will be a very relevant input for the \ndiscussion of the post-2015 development agenda.\n\nTo explore options for the future, in March Costa \nRica also hosted an international conference of \nmiddle-income countries jointly organized with the \nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization. \nIts results will help to better conceptualize the needs \nof nations like ours and the contributions that we can \nmake in terms of the post-2015 development agenda. \n\nAs part of those initiatives, we must not overlook our \nduty to strive to achieve the Millennium Development \nGoals and the need to accelerate their implementation, \nparticularly in less developed countries.\n\nThe achievements I have mentioned, as well as \nothers, have taken place under the ominous and tragic \nshadow of a world that remains very complicated. \nWe are still shocked by the brutal terrorist attack \ncommitted a few days ago in Nairobi. Today I express \nour deepest solidarity with the people of Kenya and our \nstrongest condemnation of that attack, and of terrorism \nand fanaticism. \n\nFor the past two years, we have been struck by the \ntragedy in Syria. The incessant count of massacred \nand displaced persons has been as unsettling as the \ninaction of the international community, particularly \nthe Security Council, to act in a timely way to contain \nthe crimes and the violence. After a period of paralysis \nand confusion, it seems that at last we are approaching \na solution that will lead to breaking out of that \nunacceptable stalemate. We raise our voice to demand \nthat the Security Council act decisively to eliminate \nchemical weapons in Syria, halt the violence, seek a \nnegotiated and democratic way out of the conflict and \nhold accountable those responsible for the horrible \ncrimes committed in that country.\n\nCosta Rica insists that the Security Council should \nrefer the Syrian case to the International Criminal Court. \nWe also call again on the five permanent members \nof the Council to henceforth commit themselves to \nrefraining from exercising the veto in cases of crimes \nagainst humanity.\n\nThe Syrian tragedy underscores the need to work \ndecisively towards the organic application of the \nresponsibility to protect and to promote the use of \nmediation to avoid the emergence or the worsening \nof conflicts. As a concrete measure towards such \nprevention, we urge all Member States to join the \ninitiative of Australia, Costa Rica, Denmark and Ghana \nand designate national focal points for the prevention \nof atrocities and on the responsibility to protect. The \npreventive approach is also necessary to manage \nuniversal public goods and, consequently, to exert \nglobal governance. \n\nThe prevention and reversal of global warming is \none of the most urgent issues on our crucial agenda. We \ncannot remain inactive while global warming increases, \nocean levels rise and the survival of several small \nisland States is threatened. We commend the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s plan to convene a summit on climate change \nand his promotion of the initiative entitled \u201cThe Oceans \nCompact: Healthy Oceans for Prosperity\u201d. We believe \nthat the time has come to negotiate, pursuant to the \nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Oceans, \nan international agreement on that subject.\n\nBesides being an instrument for global governance \nand the protection of universal public goods, \ninternational law entails many other dimensions. Those \ninclude respect for the sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity of States, goodwill in addressing border issues \n\n\n\f\nand observance of all the decisions of the International \nCourt of Justice. Costa Rica is a firm believer in and \nscrupulous observer of international law in all its \naspects. But that attitude contrasts with the absolute \ndisrespect of the Government of Nicaragua of the most \nelementary norms of conduct and coexistence among \nStates. That disrespect has led to open and unacceptable \naggression against our country and to the flagrant \ndisobedience of the orders of the Court at The Hague.\n\nIn October of 2010, Nicaraguan forces occupied \npart of Costa Rica\u2019s territory. Following our complaint, \nthe International Court of Justice issued provisional \nmeasures that, among other things, prohibit the presence \nof Nicaraguan personnel in the zone under dispute. \nBut Nicaragua has continued sending contingents \nof political activists, funded and organized by its \nGovernment. In August 2013, the Court reiterated its \ndemand for compliance with the provisional measures, \nbut Nicaragua has again ignored them. Their scorn \ndemonstrates the urgent need to establish procedures \nthat guarantee the respect of all decisions emanating \nfrom the Court, including precautionary measures. \nCosta Rica commits itself to work towards that goal \nand expects an open stance from the international \ncommunity.\n\nThe Nicaraguan Government, moreover, has \noffered blocks of the patrimonial sea of Costa Rica for \nexploration and exploitation of oil. It seeks to extend \nthe limits of its continental shelf by ignoring our rights \nand has broken off negotiations to secure maritime \nboundaries. It has threatened to claim a province of \nCosta Rica as its own and has restarted dredging \nworks in the zone subject to the provisional measures \nof the International Court of Justice. Furthermore, it is \npursuing a policy of increased re-armament.\n\nThe Nicaraguan and Costa Rican people wish and \ndeserve to live in peace, but the Nicaraguan Government \ninsists on preventing that. By pursuing a course of such \ndeliberate and repeated misconduct, the Government of \nNicaragua undermines international law and the very \npurpose of the United Nations.\n\nNotwithstanding the gravity of the situation, Costa \nRica remains peacefully and firmly committed to the \nwell-being and security of our population. We promote a \nmodel of development based upon harmony with nature, \nsolidarity and social inclusion, an open economy and \nopen trade, the development of our human resources, \nand innovation. We realize that development is futile \nif it is not founded on a profound respect for human \ndignity and the rights and well-being of the people. \n\nWe firmly believe that respect for and promotion \nof human rights in all its dimensions is a national and \ninternational duty. For that reason, among others, we \nremain open to all special procedures on human rights, \nand we are engaged actively and constructively in the \nHuman Rights Council.\n\nIn facing the challenges of public safety, including \ndrug trafficking and transnational organized crime, \nour country has adopted a balanced strategy whose \npositive results are evident in many areas, including the \ncontinued reduction in our homicide rate over the past \nthree years, one of the lowest in Central America. Given \nthe gravity for many nations of the challenges of drug \ntrafficking and transnational organized crime, we join \nthe call by other States from our region, such as Mexico \nand Guatemala, to re-evaluate agreed international \npolicies and to seek more effective responses against \ndrug trafficking, from a perspective of health, respect \nfor human rights and impact reduction. Along the \nsame lines, it is necessary to increase international \ncooperation to reduce the illegal flows of weapons and \nmoney that fuel criminal networks.\n\nThe new global strategy on that enormous challenge \nshould be the product of the open and inclusive debate \nduring the extraordinary session of the General \nAssembly in 2016. We salute the Antigua Declaration of \nthe General Assembly of the Organization of American \nStates as a first step to leading us in the right direction \ntowards that special session.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the actions and convictions \nI have just outlined, we respond enthusiastically to the \ncall of the President of the General Assembly to advance \nin framing the post-2015 development agenda during \nthis session. We are encouraged by his emphasis on \nmore active involvement by civil society in that process, \nthe importance assigned to human rights and the rule of \nlaw as bases for development, and his openness to new \nideas and institutional modalities, including alliances \namong multiple sectors.\n\nCosta Rica looks to the future with confidence. At \nthe same time, we are aware of the risks and challenges \nthat we face as a country, as a region and as part of \nhumankind. In that future, we see the United Nations \nas an indispensable institution, a steadfast companion, \na visionary guide and co-guardian of our tranquility \nand well-being. I pay tribute to its contributions and \n\nsincerely hope that they may multiply in the years to \ncome. \n"

I am convinced of the need to enhance our \nspirit of sharing and solidarity in order to meet the \nchallenges of promoting peace, stability and security \nand to provide humankind with all the tools needed for \nbetter mastery of its evolution.\n\nBefore continuing, I would like to congratulate the \nPresident on his election to preside over the General \nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. In addition, I would \nlike to express our recognition for the remarkable way \nin which his predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremi., presided \nover the work of the sixty-seventh session. Allow \nme also to repeat to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \n\n\n\f\nKi-moon, the expression of the esteem and recognition \nof the Government of Burkina Faso for his availability \nand staunch commitment to peace and development. \n\nThe current session is taking place in an \ninternational context characterized by relentless \neconomic difficulties and growing threats to peace \nand security on a global scale. I take this opportunity \nto express to the people of Kenya the compassion and \nsolidarity of the people of Burkina Faso following \nthe terrorist attacks that were recently perpetrated in \nNairobi.\n\nThe West African subregion continues to be marked \nby the stigma of multidimensional crises that have \ntaken place over the past two decades. Our subregion, \nand particularly the Sahelo-Saharan zone, has became a \nhideout for drug traffickers and terrorists whose desire \nto destabilize the region represents a real threat to the \npeace and security of our States.\n\nI would like to welcome the gradual improvement of \nthe situation in Mali since the deployment of the United \nNations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization \nMission in Mali and the holding of presidential elections, \nwhich supports the re-established constitutional order. \nI would also like to take this opportunity to reiterate my \nthanks to all those players who have helped to resolve \nthe crisis in Mali. To the Malian authorities and people, \nI express my warmest congratulations on the success \nof the recent presidential elections. The implementation \nof the United Nations integrated strategy for the Sahel \nwill contribute, I am convinced, to enhancing stability \nin that country and in the entire Sahelo-Saharan region. \nBurkina Faso is determined to play a role alongside the \ninternational community to achieve the objectives of \nthat strategy.\n\nDialogue is the favoured way to ensure \nunderstanding among and within peoples. Furthermore, \nthe Government of Burkina Faso supports strengthening \nsocial cohesion, broadening spaces for freedom and \ndialogue, and seeking together solutions to conflicts. It \nis in that spirit that my country has been participating \nfor two decades in peacekeeping operations conducted \nby the United Nations, the African Union and the \nEconomic Community of West African States, with \ncontingents of about 2,000 men and women who are \ndeployed in various theatres of operation. I pay tribute \nto the efforts of all those who work tirelessly to build a \nworld of peace and freedom. \n\nBeyond the resolution of sociopolitical and military \ncrises in West Africa, Burkina Faso strongly supports \nthe initiatives of the international community that \nseek to restore lasting stability in the Central African \nRepublic, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of the \nCongo, the Great Lakes region, Somalia and the Sudan.\n\nWith regard to Western Sahara, my country \nsupports the search for a political solution acceptable \nto all parties and reaffirms its support to the Moroccan \ninitiative for an autonomous status for the Saharan \nregion as a credible and realistic alternative in resolving \nthat dispute.\n\nBeyond the African continent, the situation in the \nSyrian Arab Republic urgently requires an immediate \nend to the hostilities and a search for political \nsolutions to the crisis. Therefore we encourage the \nimplementation of the American-Russian agreement of \n14 September aimed at control and dismantlement of \nchemical weapons stockpiles. \n\nWith regard to the situation in the Middle East, \nwe welcome the relaunching of direct negotiations \nbetween Israel and Palestine and strongly encourage \nthe different parties to work towards a peaceful solution \nto the conflict in order to reach a fair and equitable \nsolution based on the recognition of a Palestinian State \nliving in perfect harmony with Israel.\n\nThe climate of dialogue and d\u00e9tente that \ncharacterizes relations between the Republic of China \non Taiwan and the People\u2019s Republic of China should \nbe welcomed and encouraged. In that spirit, we must \nwelcome the Republic of China on Taiwan in the \nUnited Nations specialized agencies, particularly the \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization and the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \nWe also welcome Taiwan\u2019s incalculable contribution \nin support of the achievement by developing countries \nsuch as Burkina Faso of the Millennium Development \nGoals.\n\nPeace in Africa requires pertinant socioeconomic \ndevelopment programmes to generate effective \nresponses to the uncertainties created by the \ninternational economic situation and to strengthen \ntrust between the people and the leaders. A landlocked \ncountry of the Sahel without great natural resources, \nBurkina Faso is committed to implementing strong \npolicies in the context of its Strategy of Accelerated \nGrowth and Sustainable Development, with a view to \n\n\n\f\npromoting development and to significantly improving \nin the quality of life of the people of Burkina Faso. \n\nAs we approach the deadline for achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals, the theme of the \ncurrent session, \u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: \nsetting the stage\u201d, raises in a pertinant way the issue of \nthe dialectical relationship between development, peace \nand security. It therefore offers us an opportunity to \nfocus our thinking on a new vision in order to achieve \ncomprehensive progress, based on strong international \nsolidarity, towards sustainable development. That \nis why it is important that we redouble our efforts \nto regulate environmental issues on the basis of \nthe outcome of the United Nations Conference on \nSustainable Development (resolution 66/288, annex), \nheld in 2012 in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nPeace and stability appear as still-distant goals, \ngiven the number of centres of conflict throughout \nthe world. That situation demands that we further \nstrengthen multilateralism, rigorously apply the \nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of our Organization, \nstrengthen the instruments for promoting those ideals \nand carry out the reform of United Nations bodies, in \nparticular the Security Council. It is my hope that the \nGeneral Assembly\u2019s work at this session will contribute \nto achieving those noble objectives for a more fulfilled \nand united humankind.\n"

        "file_text": "As this is the first time \nthat I take the floor before the General Assembly, \nat the headquarters of international legitimacy and \nmultilateralism, I would like to begin by reiterating \nPortugal\u2019s firm and unwavering commitment to the \nUnited Nations, its Charter and the values and principles \nthat guide its action.\n\nI congratulate the President on his election. His long \ninternational career and vast experience in the United \nNations system have placed him in a privileged position \nto preside over the central organ of the Organization. \nHis election reflects a recognition on the part of all \nMember States of the strong commitment to the United \nNations and multilateralism of his country, Antigua \nand Barbuda, the Caribbean Community and the Group \nof Latin American and Caribbean States. I would also \nlike to convey my country\u2019s acknowledgement of the \ndynamism and dedication with which the President of \nthe General Assembly at its previous session, Mr. Vuk \nJeremi., performed his duties. I wish also to express \nspecial appreciation for the Secretary-General\u2019s \nuntiring work in defence of peace during an extremely \nchallenging period for the international community. As \nalways, the Secretary-General can continue to count on \nPortugal\u2019s support. \n\nI take this opportunity to strongly condemn the \nterrorist attack that occurred in Nairobi and to deliver a \nmessage of solidarity to the authorities and the people \nof Kenya. Acts such as those remind us that efforts \nto combat terrorism continue to be of paramount \nimportance. We will not live in a world of peace and \nliberty or in an environment of tolerance and mutual \nrespect until we eradicate terrorism.\n\nThe Organization was created to save succeeding \ngenerations from the scourge of war, basing its action \non faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity \nand worth of the human person. The United Nations has \nundertaken much in its 68 years to achieve those goals \nglobally. Unfortunately, in many regions those goals \nremain an illusion. Such is the case in Syria, where the \nhorrors of war and the unspeakable suffering of the \npopulation now prevail. The devastating images that \nreach us daily show a country that is being physically \ndestroyed. The numbers speak for themselves: more \nthan 100,000 dead, almost 7 million people in need of \nhumanitarian assistance, 4 million internally displaced \npersons and 2 million refugees. A tragedy on that \nscale is the result of serious and systematic violations \nof human rights and international humanitarian law, \naggravated by the recent and unacceptable use of \nchemical weapons, something we believed had been \nuniversally banished forever.\n\nThe world was shocked at the use of chemical \nweapons in Ghouta on 21 August. I want to be \nvery clear about this: the use of chemical weapons \nrepresents a violation of international law, a heinous \ncrime and a regression from civilization. We cannot \nstand idle in the face of such a violation of the barrier \nbetween civilization and barbarism, a barrier that the \ninternational community has vowed never to cross \nagain. We, the members of the Assembly, once again \nface a serious international crisis where we are in a \n\n\n\f\nposition to reaffirm the centrality of the United Nations \nin solving it. With the Security Council blocked and \npowerless, it was the absence of the United Nations \nin the period when prevention and control were still \npossible that allowed the Syrian crisis to reach such \ndramatic and unacceptable political and humanitarian \nproportions. We would certainly have had fewer \ncasualties and refugees, and would surely not now be \ndealing with a huge international crisis resulting from \nthe use of chemical weapons. Now, when an agreement \nhas been reached to remove the threat posed by the \nchemical arsenal of the Syrian regime once and for all, \nthe international community has again turned to the \nSecurity Council.\n\nI would like to commend the enormous political \nand diplomatic efforts of the United States and Russia, \nwith the involvement of Joint Special Envoy Lakhdar \nBrahimi. The commitment and spirit of compromise \nthat they demonstrated in the process enabled them \nto arrive at an important agreement and the adoption \nyesterday of Security Council resolution 2118 (2013), \nwhich, hopefully, will ensure its implementation. \nThe Security Council, in close collaboration with the \nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, \nhas assumed its responsibilities under the Charter of \nthe United Nations, finally creating a prospect for hope \nfor a global political solution to the Syrian issue. It is \nnow essential that we seize the opportunity created by \nthe initiative on chemical weapons to consolidate the \npolitical-diplomatic track and hold the \u201cGeneva II\u201d \nconference. Nevertheless, the primary responsibility \nfor resolving the Syrian crisis lies with the parties to the \nconflict. Without their will and commitment, no political \nsolution is possible. The international community must \nkeep up the pressure on the parties, particularly the \nDamascus regime, with a view to achieving a peaceful \nand sustainable democratic future in which every sector \nof Syrian society feels represented.\n\nThe Middle East has also seen some positive recent \ndevelopments with the resumption of the peace process \nbetween Israel and Palestine. I would like to reaffirm \nbefore the Assembly Portugal\u2019s full support for that \nprocess. I congratulate the United States of America \non its initiative and applaud the Palestinian and Israeli \nauthorities for the courage and leadership shown in their \ndecision to resume negotiations. There can be no lasting \npeace, stability or security in the Middle East unless the \nquestion of Palestine is settled. The present opportunity \nto ensure security for all and justice, finally, for the \nPalestinians must not be missed. We have a unique \nopportunity to find a peaceful solution on the basis of \nUnited Nations resolutions and internationally agreed \nparameters that establishes a sovereign, independent \nand viable Palestinian State and addresses Israel\u2019s \nsecurity concerns.\n\nAlso in the Middle East, we have been following \nwith great concern the prolonged deadlock in the \nsearch for a solution to the Iranian nuclear issue. It is \nregrettable that, despite all the diplomatic efforts and \npressure on the part of the international community, \nno solid progress has been made so far. Nevertheless, \nwe view as positive signs the recent statements made \nby high-ranking Iranian officials, in particular by \nPresident Hassan Rouhani here in the General Assembly \n(see A/68/PV.6). I appeal to the Iranian authorities \nto translate those encouraging political signals into \nconcrete steps conducive to a negotiated solution that \ncan restore the international community\u2019s confidence \nin a peaceful and civilian Iranian nuclear programme.\n\nAnother issue of concern is the situation in the \nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau, where the constitutional \norder has been subverted since the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat of \n12 April 2012. As a member of the European Union, the \nCommunity of Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP) \nand the United Nations, and in close coordination with \nthe Economic Community of West African States, \nas well as through bilateral measures, Portugal is \ncontinuing with its efforts to help the people of Guinea-\nBissau overcome the current crisis. We acknowledge \nthe work done by Special Representative of the \nSecretary-General Ramos-Horta to promote a dialogue \namong the main political actors with a view to restoring \nthe constitutional order. The formation of an inclusive \nGovernment was, in that sense, a step forward.\n\nHowever, restoring constitutional order and \nnormalizing Guinea-Bissau\u2019s relations with the \ninternational community require that presidential \nand legislative elections be held, in accordance with \nthe commitments undertaken by the current Guinean \nauthorities and as reiterated in the press statement \nissued by the President of the Security Council on \n11 September. We are, however, very concerned about \nthe possibility that has been raised of a new extension \nof the transitional period. The international community \nshould also emphasize that for the elections to be \nfree, fair and transparent, the current authorities must \nguarantee that all Guinean citizens, without exception, \ncan participate in those elections, in full enjoyment \n\n\n\f\nof their rights, including the rights of the freedoms of \nspeech and association. Only a new Government that \nenjoys the legitimacy conferred by a free popular vote \nand is appointed in accordance with the Constitution \ncan promote long-overdue reforms in the security, \nadministration and justice sectors.\n\nThe crisis in Guinea-Bissau also has clear and \nworrying connections with the Sahel region through \ndrug-trafficking routes. Europe, and especially its \nsouthern countries, is following the situation in \nthe Sahel with particular concern. I can assure the \nAssembly that we will continue to make every effort \nto help stabilize the region. In that context, the United \nNations integrated strategy for the Sahel represents a \nmajor contribution.\n\nPortugal is currently co-President of the Western \nMediterranean forum known as the 5+5 initiative, \nwhich brings together 10 countries on the northern \nand southern Mediterranean coasts. The dialogue and \nconfidence-building that that informal instrument \nprovides represents important added value for its \nmembers and the region. We are therefore engaged in \nexploring all of its potential for cooperation.\n\nThe Charter of the United Nations defends the \nimportance of using international mechanisms to \npromote the economic and social advancement of all \npeoples. In the noble spirit of the United Nations and \nfollowing the historic and inspiring launch in 2000 \nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the \ncurrent session of the General Assembly will be a \ncritical launching pad for defining our priorities and the \npath we will follow in our common efforts towards the \n2015 summit at which we will adopt our development \nprinciples and goals for the coming years.\n\nI commend the President for the timeliness of his \nchoice of theme for this general debate, \u201cThe post-\n2015 development agenda: setting the stage\u201d. On \n25 September, I had an opportunity to participate in the \nspecial event on the Millennium Development Goals, \nwhich enabled us to thoroughly discuss the progress \nachieved to date on the MDGs and provide important \nguidance for our future work. It is our conviction that \nthe set of MDGs should serve as the reference point for \nestablishing the new development agenda, which should \nmaintain a focus on poverty reduction and sustainable \ndevelopment in all its dimensions, while giving special \nattention to the needs of least developed countries.\n\nBut we need a broader, more inclusive and strategic \nvision. We must go beyond the traditional relationship \nbetween donors and recipients to create partnerships that \ninvolve new international actors. For Portugal, different \nmodalities of assistance, new sources of financing \nand a strengthened principle of shared responsibility, \nleadership and ownership on the part of developing \ncountries are the main guiding principles for the post-\n2015 development agenda. The inaugural meeting of the \nHigh-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development \nwas politically highly significant. Portugal remains \ncommitted to ensuring that the Forum acts as a catalyst \nfor international efforts, ensuring a more efficient and \ncoherent link between the various processes in the area \nof sustainable development and poverty eradication.\n\nIn the context of the outcome of the 2012 United \nNations Conference on Sustainable Development, I \nwould like to stress the importance of progress on the \nissue of oceans, which is a crucial matter for a maritime \ncountry like Portugal. We welcome Member States\u2019 \ncommitment to discussing the issue of the conservation \nand sustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond \nareas of national jurisdiction. In this context, Portugal \nis strongly in favour of the negotiation and adoption \nof an international instrument in the framework of the \nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\n\nReforms and institutional innovations such as those \nI have just mentioned represent important changes \nin the architecture of the United Nations, adapting \nand preparing it for new times and new challenges. \nHowever, the reform of our Organization will never be \ncomplete without Security Council reform, including of \nits working methods and, above all, of its composition. \nIt is increasingly difficult to justify why countries such \nas Brazil and India are not permanent members of the \nSecurity Council. As stated on previous occasions, \nPortugal is of the view that Africa also deserves \npermanent representation in that body. It is imperative \nthat Africa be treated in a way that is just and reflects its \nsize, economic growth and its weight in today\u2019s world.\n\nI take this opportunity to congratulate the African \nUnion and its member States on the fiftieth anniversary \nof the continent\u2019s regional organization.\n\nPortugal firmly believes in multilateralism and in \nthe United Nations as the centre for harmonizing the \nactions of nations in the attainment of common ends. \nWe contribute actively to the work of our Organization \nthrough a committed participation in its bodies, but we \n\n\n\f\nhave not yet had a chance to serve on the Human Rights \nCouncil. We therefore hope to be able to count on the \nsupport of the Assembly in the elections for that body \nto take place in 2014. We accept and have implemented \nvirtually all of the 86 recommendations that resulted \nfrom our experience in the Council\u2019s universal periodic \nreview (UPR) of 2009. We will submit to a new UPR \nin 2014. \n\nIf the Assembly invests its trust in us to elect us to \nserve for the 2015-2017 triennium, we will fulfil our \nmandate in the deep conviction that the United Nations \nhuman-rights-protection system should remain strong, \nindependent, impartial and demanding, and that, in \nthis regard, we should always resolve to aim higher. \nWe will continue in the same vein as we approached \nour membership of the Security Council in 2011-\n2012, characterized by openness to dialogue and by a \nconstructive and balanced attitude, and seeking to build \nbridges and generate consensus, without relinquishing \nvalues and fundamental principles.\n\nThe Portuguese language is the common element of \nunity that brings together the diversity of States of the \nCommunity of Portuguese-speaking Countries. We are \na Community of eight countries, with about 250 million \nspeakers spread across four continents. Portuguese is \nthe third most widely spoken European language in the \nworld, with a growing role and status on the international \nscene, both as a vehicle of communication and as an \neconomic language used in trade and business, culture \nand social networks.\n\nIn October, Lisbon will host the second conference \non the status of the Portuguese language in the \ninternational system, at which participants will consider \nthe challenges faced by their common language. \nPortuguese is currently the official or working language \nof several international organizations, including some \nspecialized agencies of the United Nations. The CPLP \nhas the ambition and goal of seeing Portuguese adopted \nas an official language of the United Nations. I take \nthis opportunity to salute the Mozambican presidency \nof the CPLP and its efforts to strengthen and deepen \nour Community.\n\nI conclude by wishing the greatest success for the \nGeneral Assembly at this session. The Assembly can \ncount on Portugal\u2019s active contribution and support in \nupholding international law, promoting the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes, defending and promoting human \nrights, and working towards greater prosperity for all of \nhumankind.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an honour, Mr. President, for me to address the \nGeneral Assembly. Things have changed since I was first \nhere, and not only because time has passed and we have \nall become a little older \u2014 not that old age is a problem. \nThe problem is how we approach it and, indeed, how we \napproach disability. That is why Ecuador believes that, \nin the context of the 2015 and post-2015 development \nagenda, we should include quantitative targets with \nmeasurable goals for persons with disabilities, together \nwith international cooperation. Let us never again \nadopt a development agenda that fails to take account \nof persons with disabilities and their families. We must \ntake specific measures to incorporate disability at \nthe global, regional and national levels with a view to \nachieving verifiable results.\n\nAs I was saying, things have changed since my first \nvisit to the General Assembly Hall. Many words have \nreverberated within its walls, and ended up who knows \nwhere. Much has been said, and perhaps even the \nmost patient among us is becoming a little exhausted. \nOur address, which may contain many impromptu \ncomments, states things as we find them. I see, as others \nperhaps have, that every day it is becoming increasingly \ndifficult to reach this colourful, cosmopolitan city. I do \nnot think that is what its inhabitants want, for with their \nclamour they seem to be celebrating the diversity of the \nworld that is characteristic of New York. It is in fact the \nbureaucrats that put obstacles in our way, drawing lines \nthat are frequently difficult to cross.\n\nWhat shall we do in future years in the face of the \nobstacles that sometimes isolate the United Nations \nHeadquarters? How can we, with the agreement of \nall, ensure that the Charter of the United Nations is \n\n\n\f\nrespected? The host country, which is well aware how \ndiverse the Organization is, wants to be the sole arbiter \nof who can come and who cannot, on the basis of its \nown likes and dislikes.\n\nThat very powerful State has also taken it upon \nitself to spy on us, on the pretext of safeguarding its own \nsecurity. It is true that human beings everywhere have \nlived through times of fear and terror. There is good \nreason to be vigilant. But the history of humankind, \nand consequently of the Organization, is in part the \nrecording of an evolution in the rights of every one of \nus. We have been building and reinforcing rights that \nwe consider to already have been established, such as \nthe privacy and inviolability of communications. It is \ntherefore regrettable that, at a time when technological \nadvances have enabled every man and every woman \nto communicate with every other man and every other \nwoman throughout the world, an Administration has set \nup a global surveillance system that knows no borders, \nthat does not differentiate between friends and enemies \nand that fails to distinguish between criminals and law-\nabiding citizens.\n\nLet us be frank: it is not the existence of a system \nthat intrudes upon the private life of every person in \nthe world that surprises us. We all in fact suspected \nthat such a system existed. No, it is its sheer scope \nthat confounds us \u2014 a global espionage system \nthat knows no limits, without even respect for the \nbounds of common decency, and without regard for \nthe sovereignty of States and the right to privacy and \nfreedom of expression of all citizens.\n\nIt cannot be denied that the bonds of trust between \nStates and Governments, which underpin negotiations, \namong other things, and effective agreements to combat \ninternational organized crime, including terrorism, have \nbeen seriously compromised by the unrestrained actions \nof the United States, which has taken it upon itself to spy \non our communications. Many of the countries affected \nhave requested, on behalf of their Governments and \ncitizens, that the United States Government account \nfor its universal espionage programmes, but have not to \ndate received a satisfactory response.\n\nOn numerous occasions, we have heard the \nrepresentatives of the United States Government \nexpress to the United Nations their readiness to discuss \nthe issue. My delegation is willing to initiate such a \ndiscussion forthwith, in a frank, clear and open fashion, \nand believes that there is no better forum for doing \nso than the Assembly and its Committees, without \nexcluding such other entities as the Human Rights \nCouncil.\n\nBecause we believe that this is the forum in which \nto defend the right of all peoples to be respected, \nbeginning with respect for their territorial integrity, we \nare reitereating, for the umpteenth time, that the time \nhas come for the Israeli settlements to cease and for \nPalestine to be respected and recognized within the \n1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\n\nAlong the same lines, we would like to make \na democratic appeal: 188 of the Organization\u2019s 193 \nMember States have clearly stated that it is time to end \nthe unjust embargo that the United States has imposed \non Cuba. Cuba is part of the Bolivarian Alliance for \nthe Peoples of Our Americas. Cuba is a member State \nof the Community of Latin American and Caribbean \nStates. Cuba is part of the international community, \nand its people cannot continue to suffer the harmful \nconsequences of that embargo.\n\nWe also would like to reiterate our belief that \ndialogue can resolve the Malvinas Islands conflict. The \nUnited Kingdom must accede to what has been called \nfor at the United Nations so often, that is, to sit at the \nnegotiating table and leave the history of overseas \nterritories to the shameful past. The Malvinas lie \nvery close to Argentina, and quite far from the United \nKingdom.\n\nAllow me briefly to mention that, in my country, \nwe have recognized the rights of nature. We have to \nwager on different things. We must rein in the capacity \nto devastate of those who want unlimited growth even \nat the cost of ecological balances. Once disrupted, \nnature itself will restore those balances and all of us \nwill be cast out, with not even a trace remaining of what \nwe arrogantly call civilization.\n\nWe have therefore decided to raise our voice \nagainst the high-handedness of some multinational \nfirms \u2014 and in that regard have had the support of other \nGovernments \u2014 whose unbridled pursuit of unlimited \nprofit subjugates human beings for the sake of capital, \ndamages the environment and violates human rights, all \nthe while having us believe that it is possible to bring a \nState and its people to its knees.\n\nEcuador has stood up to the defamatory campaign \nof one such company. In 2011, Chevron was ordered \nto pay $19 billion in response to the claim lodged by \n30,000 inhabitants of my country who were affected by \nthe devastating pollution that firm left behind in the \n\n\n\f\nAmazon. I should make it clear that it was not the State \nof Ecuador that sued the corporation, it was our people.\n\nWe must also denounce the overwhelming statistics \nshowing how arbitration tribunals fail countries such \nas mine, which, paradoxically, can serve to shed \nlight on the web of intersecting interests among \nbusinesses, arbitrators and lawyers associated with \nsuch tribunals. We in South America have undertaken \nvarious initiatives, such as the establishment of a \ndispute-settlement centre within the Union of South \nAmerican Nations. The centre will play a key role in \nreconfiguring the balance between national public \ninterests and multinational private profits.\n\nMy country condemns the violence being \nexperienced in Syria, as well as serious violations of \ninternational law and human rights, regardless of their \nsource. From the outset, Ecuador has argued that a \nmilitary solution is not a way out of the crisis in Syria. \nWe must always address armed conflicts head-on, \nsetting aside any manipulation in sole pursuit of outside \ninterests. We should allow comprehensive solutions \nbased on international law to bear fruit and flourish.\n\nIn that context, the situation in Syria, a millennial \nnation facing a terrible period, deserves our sincere \nand sustained attention, for hundreds of thousands of \nhuman lives have been lost and thousands of others \nconstantly confront danger.\n\nEcuador welcomes as a positive step Syria\u2019s recent \naccession to the Convention on the Prohibition of the \nDevelopment, Production, Stockpiling and Use of \nChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction. We look \nforward to the final results of the investigations by the \nUnited Nations on all claims of chemical weapons in \nSyria, because only on the basis of those results can \nthe international community be confident of having a \nsufficiently broad and much more credible overview.\n\nAs an executive member of the Organization for the \nProhibition of Chemical Weapons, Ecuador joined the \nconsensus on the adoption of the decision on chemical \nweapons in the Syrian Arab Republic. We did so because \nwe believed that decision reflected the endeavours of \nthe international community to preserve peace, defend \nthe lives of Syrian citizens and move towards a political \nsolution to the crisis.\n\nWe also note, and we consider it very important, \nthat the Security Council\u2019s decision should not be \ninterpreted by any State as a justification for unilateral \naction that violates international law, which prohibits \nthe use or the threat of the use of force and calls for \nrespect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial \nintegrity of States. As a State party to the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, we condemn the use of chemical \nweapons in the Syrian Arab Republic by any party. We \nalso reiterate the obligation of States to refrain from \nproviding any type of military support to non-State \nactors.\n\nThose are some of the topics that cause us major \nconcern. There will be more, voiced by others, so \nthat we can ultimately approach the world with hope \nand restore our human capacity to be able to continue \nbelieving in what inspired the establishment of the \nUnited Nations: dialogue for the sake of peace, as well \nas democracy, justice, inclusion and equality and as an \nantidote to war.\n"

        "file_text": "I would \nlike first of all to warmly congratulate Mr. John Ashe, \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth \nsession, and his predecessor Mr. Vuk Jeremi. on their \nexcellent work. I would also like to commend our \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for the steady \nenhancement of the role and status of the United \nNations under his leadership. \n\nThe designation of the post-2015 development \nagenda as the central theme not only of this general \ndebate but also for this entire session is a timely reminder \nof the role of the United Nations in promoting peace \nand prosperity throughout the world, for the benefit \nof all humankind. Indeed, more than ever before, we \nneed the visionary role of the United Nations in order \nto face up to the ills besetting humankind. The growing \nchallenges arising from our increased interdependence \nare exacerbated by a multidimensional crisis that \nadversely affects our economies and governance and \nhas disastrous social and humanitarian consequences. \nThe only worthy response to the upheaval and dangers \nof our day is a determined quest for peace, justice and \nsolidarity, in order to build with confidence that better \nfuture that we must bequeath to future generations.\n\nConsideration of the post-2015 agenda warrants \na serious relaunching of the debate on development \nissues, particularly in terms of the elimination of \npoverty, a phenomenon that continues not only to \naffect the dignity of millions of human beings but also \nto threaten their lives. The international community \nshould be primarily concerned at the lack of significant \nprogress in its fight against poverty. \n\nOvercoming poverty is a long-standing endeavour \nthat requires appropriate public policies coupled with \neffective international cooperation and consistent \nproductive flows of investment, as well as greater \ncomplementarity between the United Nations and the \nBretton Woods institutions, with a view to exploiting \nsynergies in the context of the peace-security-\ndevelopment triad. That means that new objectives for \n2030 must be part of a global integral approach that \nreflects the disparities among regions, an improvement \nof the balance between urban and rural development, \nthe strengthening of the capacities of poor people, \ngood governance, the fight against corruption and the \n\n\n\f\nprotection of the environment. In fact, it is a question \nof reaching an ambitious global agreement for the \npromotion of sustainable development containing \ncommitments stemming from the principle of shared \nbut differentiated responsibility, in particular for the \nmobilization of the financing needed for capacity-\nbuilding and the transfer of know-how and technology.\n\nUnder its 2010-2014 five-year plan, Algeria is \nimplementing a human development strategy that sets \nforth ambitious policies to promote social justice and \nbalanced regional preparations, within a framework \nof strict resource management, where the education, \nhealth, housing and infrastructure sectors continue to \nbe given priority, backed by investment in economic \ngrowth. Those extensive efforts are naturally supported \nat the international level by multifaceted assistance to \ncountries affected by crises and natural disasters and \nby the effective integration of debt relief for the poorest \ncountries in Africa and other parts of the world.\n\nAt the same time, Algeria is projecting its own \ndevelopment in the context of the historic coherence of \nthe great Arab Maghreb Union project that the peoples \nof the region aspire to profoundly. That overall initiative \ncame from the agenda of the President of the Republic, \nMr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, and is aimed at making all \nAlgerian men and women free from fear and need.\n\nThe celebration this year of the fiftieth anniversary \nof the Organization of African Unity-African Union \nunder the theme of \u201cAfrican Renaissance\u201d is an \nimportant milestone in the rise of our continent on \nthe stage of history, giving us grounds for hope and \nambition, as well as promises of African solutions for \nthe problems of Africa, with the assistance of the rest \nof the international community. Algeria is participating \nin that shared destiny of the African peoples, and \nwe welcome and are gratified by the progress made \ntowards the recovery and economic development of the \ncontinent and the considerable rates of growth that have \nbeen recorded. We are also gratified at Africa\u2019s steady \nprogress towards conflict prevention and settlement. \n\nWe also welcome the achievements of good \ngovernance, human rights and pluralist democracy. \nAlgeria is particularly delighted at the liberation of the \nregions in the north of Mali from the claws of terrorist \nand criminal groups as well as the restoration of the \nconstitutional order in this fraternal country with the \nclear success of the presidential elections.\n\nAlgeria, which remains the target of international \nterrorism \u2014 as we were reminded by the violent \nterrorist attack carried out against the Tiguentourine \ngas complex early this year \u2014 is making an effective \ncontribution to the joint efforts to promote collective \nsecurity in the Sahelo-Saharan region as well as in the \nrest of Africa and beyond. Whether it is a question of \nSomalia, Darfur, relations between the Sudan and South \nSudan, the Great Lakes region, the Central African \nRepublic or efforts to restore constitutional order in a \nnumber of brotherly countries, Algeria is harmoniously \nblending its voice and efforts with those of the African \nUnion.\n\nAlgeria, which is resolutely committed to the \nright of peoples to self-determination, supports the \nintensification of the efforts of the Personal Envoy of the \nSecretary-General for Western Sahara, Mr. Christopher \nRoss, to prevail on the two parties to the conflict \u2014 the \nKingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front \u2014 to \nagree in negotiations on the lifting of all obstacles, so \nthat the people of Western Sahara can freely determine \ntheir own future. \n\nAlgeria is naturally supportive of the Arab \npeoples, who are experiencing difficult transitions and \nare confronting multiple challenges in a particularly \ndelicate phase of democratic and socioeconomic \ntransformation. We encourage the promotion of \npolitical solutions to governance crises as well as the \nmanagement by consensus of these critical transitional \nperiods. Clearly, military solutions are neither possible \nnor desirable in the context of the polarization of \nsocieties and the exacerbation of partisan interests and \ndissent.\n\nAlgeria reaffirms its rejection of the threat or use \nof weapons of mass destruction. In that regard, we \ncategorically condemn the use of chemical weapons in \nthe Syrian conflict, regardless of who the perpetrators \nwere or the circumstances. In welcoming the initiative \nof the Russian Federation and the Russian-American \nagreement as well as the adherence of Syria to the \nChemical Weapons Convention, Algeria calls for the \ncreation of political momentum towards the holding of \nthe Geneva II conference and the attainment of a political \nsolution among the parties in Syria. We reiterate our \nencouragement and support for Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi \nas he leads those praiseworthy peace efforts.\n\nIn a Middle East mired in dangers and crises, a just \nsettlement of the question of Palestine remains at the \n\n\n\f\nheart of any serious effort to stabilize the region. While \nwelcoming the efforts of the United States, which led \nto a resumption of negotiations, Algeria expresses the \nhope that the international community can redouble its \nefforts for the rapid establishment of an internationally \nrecognized Palestinian State within the borders of June \n1967, with Al-Quds as its capital.\n\nThe legitimacy of the United Nations must be \nstrengthened and its role enhanced, and to that end its \nreform must not be unduly delayed. We must ensure that \nthe General Assembly remains participatory in nature \nand must increase the economic, social, humanitarian \nand environmental functions of the programmes, \nentities and agencies of the United Nations system. \nWe must also agree on a democratic reform of the \nSecurity Council that covers its working methods and \nits composition and ensures equitable representation, \ntaking into particular account the African States\u2019 \nEzulwini Consensus. \n\nThe United Nations must be heeded when, from \nwithin the democratic framework of the General \nAssembly, it issues statements of strong positions that \nreflect the universal conscience, whether it is a question \nof strengthening the foundations of international \nhumanitarian law and protecting civilians or specific \nsituations, such as the long overdue lifting of the \neconomic blockade that has been imposed on Cuba for \ndecades now and the current one imposed on the Gaza \nStrip. The will of the international community that is so \noften reiterated here must prevail.\n\nAlgeria is working within the organizations and \ngroups to which it belongs and with its other partners \ntowards the elimination of the many obstacles to \nbuilding peaceful, well-balanced and just international \nrelations. We are nurturing the virtues of dialogue, \nand we place our hopes in the Alliance of Civilization \nand mutual respect among religions. Algeria is deeply \ndedicated to the heritage of the values shared by all \nhumankind, beginning with the sacred nature, value \nand dignity of human beings and the promotion and \nprotection of all human rights. \n\nIt is this commitment that inspires Algeria\u2019s \ncandidature for a seat on the Human Rights Council \nfor the 2014-2016 period. This year marks the twentieth \nanniversary of the Vienna Declaration and Programme \nof Action, and Algeria, moved by a high sense of \nresponsibility, would like to dedicate itself to improving \nthe effectiveness of the Council, strengthening the \nuniversal and interdependent nature of human rights \nand mobilizing the international community in this \nlofty collective endeavour.\n\nAs a member of the Council, Algeria will share its \nexperience in human rights and in the rights of peoples. \nWe will endeavour to improve our own performance \nby, inter alia, adapting our national legislation and \nharmonizing it with the relevant international treaties \nand promoting the inclusion of all segments of society, \nincluding women, who now comprise 31 per cent of the \ndeputies elected to the People\u2019s National Assembly last \nyear. All of these factors make Algeria a good candidate \nfor the Human Rights Council and have won it the \nsupport of the League of Arab States, the Organization \nof Islamic Cooperation and the African Union.\n\nAlmost 40 years ago, in 1974, President Abdelaziz \nBouteflika, who was at that time Minister for Foreign \nAffairs of Algeria and President of the General \nAssembly at its twenty-ninth session, made significant \nhistory here by putting an end to the usurpation of the \npeople of South Africa\u2019s representation by the apartheid \nregime and by welcoming to this Hall for the first time \nthe Palestine Liberation Organization, thus opening \nup two significant paths towards peace. Since then, \nprodigious advances in science and technology, which \nhave increased the power of humankind over nature, \nand changes in the very fabric of the international \ncommunity have only increased the expectations of our \npeoples, for whom the United Nations remains the best \nrefuge. May God inspire us to work in the best interests \nof our countries and our peoples. \n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of \nthe Philippine Government, I proffer my warmest \ncongratulations to the President on his election. I wish \nhim success and assure him of my country\u2019s steadfast \nsupport for his presidency.\n\nThe theme that has been selected for this session \nis indeed timely and relevant. We must start setting \nthe stage for the new development agenda that will \nsucceed the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nframework. Barely two years before its deadline, \nconsiderable work still lies ahead of us. For instance, the \nglobal economic and financial crisis has underscored \nthe need for reform towards greater systemic \ncoherence; the multilateral trading system remains \nfrozen in the past; and the persistence of an outdated \ndevelopment paradigm results in policy prescriptions \nand conditionalities inimical to the interests of many \ndeveloping countries.\n\nAs we set the stage for the post-2015 framework, let \nus reaffirm the very raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the United Nations, \nwhich is to accord every person the opportunity at a life \nthat is secure, progressive and dignified. That purpose \nis enshrined in the Philippine Constitution and is central \nto President Benigno Aquino III\u2019s social contract \nwith the Filipino people. Under President Aquino\u2019s \nleadership, my country has embarked on a journey \nalong a straight path \u2014 or, as we say in Filipino, \u201cdaang \nmatuwid\u201d \u2014 resolving to work towards inclusive \ngrowth, combating corruption, promoting transparency \nand accountability, improving global competitiveness, \nmaking better use of resources, achieving just and \nlasting peace, and upholding the rule of law.\n\nThe Aquino Administration firmly maintains that \ngood governance is good economics. As a result, the \nPhilippines is reaping the first fruits of its hard work. \nIn the past four quarters, the Philippine economy has \nexperienced unprecedented growth of over 7 per cent. \nAs a result, the Philippines won three investment-grade \nratings and is now considered a growth engine in the \nregion.\n\n\n\f\nThese glowing reports are, of course, well received \nby my Government, but we are under no illusion that \nthese indicators alone constitute success. For the past \n13 years, the MDGs have been integrated into the \nPhilippine development plan for 2011-2016. Yet our \nwork continues and the challenge we now face is clear. \nIt is how to ensure that growth is inclusive, resilient and \nsustainable. As we pursue the path towards this very type \nof growth, my Government is guided by the following \nimportant lessons learned from our experience in \nworking towards the Millennium Development Goals.\n\nFirst, strong institutional arrangements are \nnecessary. For the Philippines, that means that the \nhighest political support is given to the attainment of \nthe MDGs, involving all branches of Government and \nother key stakeholders.\n\nSecondly, specific policies, programmes and \nprojects must be aligned with national development \ngoals. In our MDG experience, innovative social \nprotection programmes include conditional cash \ntransfers, universal health care, the comprehensive \nand integrated delivery of social services, a K-12 basic \neducation programme, and a community mortgage \nprogramme.\n\nThirdly, the active participation of various \nstakeholders \u2014 namely, the private sector, civil society, \nnon-governmental organizations, the constituents and \ninternational development partners \u2014 must be strongly \npromoted and supported. This ensures that policies and \nprogrammes are responsive and inclusive.\n\nFourthly, local Government units should be \nempowered. Beyond the delivery of basic social \nservices, the capacities of local Government units in \nformulating and implementing policies and programmes \nmust be strengthened and guided by the principles of \ntransparency and accountability.\n\nFifthly, the capability to generate accurate, timely \nand relevant data at the national and local levels must \nbe enhanced.\n\nSixthly, disaster risk reduction must be \nmainstreamed to enable communities to better cushion \nthe impact of man-made and natural disasters. Building \nthe capacities of national and local stakeholders to help \nreduce the vulnerability and increase the physical and \neconomic resilience of communities must be a key \ndevelopment goal.\n\nThese important elements will further enrich the \nUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework \n2012-2018 for the Philippines. With the overall theme \n\u201cSupporting inclusive, sustainable and resilient \ndevelopment\u201d, the United Nations Development \nAssistance Framework seeks to fully align United \nNations work with the Philippine Development Plan \n2011-2016.\n\nMy Government is actively participating in the \ninternational discourse on sustainable development \nand in crafting the post-2015 development agenda. The \nPhilippines was one of 66 countries chosen by the United \nNations to conduct open, inclusive and transparent \nconsultations with a broad range of stakeholders \naimed at generating perspectives on how the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda framework should look. We took \nto this task earnestly by undertaking consultations \nwith more than 500 stakeholders representing the \nGovernment, civil society, the business community and \nacademia.\n\nOur national consultations on the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda have identified the following \nbuilding blocks of the new framework, as well as \nthe development themes deemed most relevant to the \nPhilippines. These building blocks are composed of \nfour principles, five themes and various development \nenablers, and were offered to the United Nations \nsystem as the Philippines\u2019 contribution to the ongoing \ndiscourse.\n\nWe need look no further than the United Nations \nCharter to identify the building blocks for the global \npost-2015 development agenda. For this agenda to be \nrelevant and responsive, it must be anchored in four \nmain principles: human rights; equality, equity, people \nempowerment, social cohesion and justice; accountable \ngovernance; and inclusive development.\n\nMy country has identified five pillars that we believe \nwill address our own specific development challenges. \nThese pillars represent the areas where progress is most \nneeded to build a rights-based, equitable and sustainable \nsociety. These pillars are poverty reduction and social \ninclusion; environmental sustainability, climate change \nand disaster risk management; accountable, responsive \nand participatory governance; a fair and stable order \nbased on the international rule of law; and peace and \nsecurity.\n\nMy Government will formulate and implement \npolicies that will be defined by these pillars. These \n\n\n\f\npolicies will duly be integrated into my country\u2019s \nnational development agenda, and progress will be \nmonitored at regular intervals. On the global front, the \nPhilippines proposes that the duration of the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda should be 10 years, with a major \nreview to be undertaken by 2020. Reforms should be \nfront-loaded within the first half of the period to pave \nthe way for substantive accomplishments by 2020.\n\nAllow me to further elaborate on aspects of the \nprinciples and themes the Philippines has put forward. \nThe Philippines continues to aspire to a global \neconomic system that places development at the centre \nand promotes democracy in international economic \ndecision-making. Ultimately, it behoves us to consider \nreform of the overall global economic system as we \ncraft a sound, sustainable development agenda.\n\nTo achieve meaningful reform, what we need now \nis a strong political impetus from all of us to make \nthis happen. Governments must see beyond political \ndifferences and agree to work together to ensure a \nlevel global playing field. It is for this reason that the \nPhilippines staunchly supports the High-level Political \nForum on sustainable development goals.\n\nThe post-2015 development agenda should squarely \naddress migration. It is a cross-cutting issue relevant \nto our efforts to promote human rights, reduce poverty \nand foster sustainable development. The Philippines, \nfor its part, will continue to advocate the protection of \nthe rights of migrants, regardless of migration status; \nthe recognition of migrants\u2019 positive contribution to \ndevelopment in the sending and receiving countries \nalike; and the creation of programmes that support \nfamilies, especially the children who are left behind.\n\nOur national experience of these issues will be \nmy Government\u2019s contribution to the discussion in \nthe forthcoming High-level Dialogue on International \nMigration and Development later this week. In \naddition, we hope to include in the discussion the plight \nof migrants who find themselves in conflict areas \u2014 a \nsituation that my Government has had to address in \nrecent years. In several instances, we have repatriated \nFilipino workers to get them out of harm\u2019s way.\n\nOur experience has been instructive and enriching, \nas it has opened for us new windows of cooperation \nwith our bilateral partners, as well as with the United \nNations, the International Organization for Migration \nand other international organizations. My Government \nwants to focus international discussion on the plight of \nthese migrants, with a view to forging creative platforms \non which States \u2014 whether countries of origin, transit \nor destination \u2014 can cooperate to better address this \ncomplex issue.\n\nThe Philippines hopes that the High-level Dialogue \nwill reaffirm that migration is an indispensable \nelement in the global sustainable development agenda. \nMigration influences each country\u2019s socioeconomic \ngrowth, human capital and involvement in global \naffairs. Managing migration through policies that \nuphold the dignity of the individual should therefore be \na vital component in the development agenda of each \nnation and of the world.\n\nAchieving sustainable development requires \nan enabling environment of peace, security and the \nrule of law. It is to this end that my Government\u2019s \napproach in managing conflicts within and outside \nits borders is anchored in international law. As such, \nwe avail ourselves of the various means for the \npeaceful settlement of disputes, including mediation \nand arbitration, in accordance with Chapter VI of the \nUnited Nations Charter.\n\nAs declared by the General Assembly in its \nresolution 37/10, on the peaceful settlement of \ninternational disputes, otherwise known as the 1982 \nManila Declaration, recourse to the judicial settlement \nof legal disputes should not be considered an unfriendly \nact between States. On the contrary, it is a measure that \ngenerates clarity, benefiting all stakeholders. In this \nspirit, my country reaffirms its unwavering support \nfor the International Court of Justice and the various \nspecialized tribunals, such as the dispute settlement \nmechanisms of the World Trade Organization and the \nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\n\nThe Philippines has also relentlessly and tirelessly \npursued the peace process in the southern Philippines. \nThe signing of the Framework Agreement on the \nBangsamoro was a milestone in this regard. We remain \nsteadfastly committed to achieving just and lasting \npeace that will be inclusive for all.\n\nFurthermore, in accordance with the application of \nthe rule of law and the peaceful settlement of disputes, \nthe Philippines, as a State party to the Chemical \nWeapons Convention and a staunch advocate of \ndisarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction, also welcomes Syria\u2019s accession to \nthe Treaty. The Philippines hopes that the Organization \nfor the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will \n\n\n\f\neffectively assist the Syrian Government in disposing \nof its chemical weapons stockpiles.\n\nThe Philippine Government\u2019s commitment to \npeace is resolute. This commitment is demonstrated \nin its continued participation in United Nations \npeacekeeping missions, particularly in the United \nNations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in \nthe occupied Golan where, despite the dangers, our \npeacekeepers have stood their ground. Their courage to \nstay and hold the line at the most critical time led to the \ncontinued fulfilment of UNDOF\u2019s mandate as charged \nby the Security Council.\n\n\nThe post-2015 development agenda also demands \nthat Governments address the devastating effects of \nclimate change and natural disasters. My country \nis among those at highest risk from typhoons, \nearthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis. In terms \nof disaster management, my Government has instituted \na cluster model that mobilizes both Government and \nnon-governmental entities at the local and national \nlevels, as well as international partners. The United \nNations has recognized this model as a best practice \nthat other countries could emulate. We will continue \nto share our knowledge and experience in disaster-\nrisk reduction, preparedness, response and recovery to \nhelp other States better manage similar occurrences. \nIn 2015, we will also actively participate in the World \nHumanitarian Summit and in the review of the Hyogo \nFramework for Action, our blueprint for disaster risk \nreduction cooperation.\n\nThe year 2015 marks an important juncture in the \nhistory of nations. It will mark the beginning of a new \nera of sustainable development, one, it is hoped, that \ngives every individual on this planet a better chance \nat a better quality of life. That may sound ambitious; \nit may even sound daunting. Yet, this is an historic \ntime and historic times call for acts of great ambition. \nOur national hero, Mr. Jos\u00e9 Rizal, also recognized the \nimportance of ambition and ideals. He wrote that\n\n\u201cit is a useless life that is not consecrated to a great \nideal. It is like a stone wasted on the field without \nbecoming a part of any edifice\u201d.\nLet the post-2015 development agenda be the edifice \nupon which we will manifest the collective dreams and \nideals of humankind.\n"

        "file_text": "First of all, I would like to \noffer my heartfelt congratulations to Mr. John Ashe for \nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-eighth session. \n\nIn one month\u2019s time, it will have been 70 years \nsince the Foreign Ministers of the four major Powers \nagreed to set up a universal organization dedicated to \nensuring international peace and security. In Moscow, \nin 1943, high representatives of the United States, the \nSoviet Union, China and the United Kingdom took that \ndecision in the very midst of the most devastating war in \nhuman history. They knew that maintaining peace and \nthe creed of \u201cwar no more\u201d required harmonious and \nconcerted international cooperation. They knew that \nit required collaboration among the great Powers and \nrespect for the principles of international law, as well as \nthe building of infrastructure for peace. The declaration \npublished back then rightly spoke of the need to act for \njustice among nations. That is important, because it is \nfrom injustice or from the sense of a lack of justice that \nmany conflicts, both internal and international, have \noriginated and continue to originate.\n\nOn the eve of that anniversary, it is worth examining \nto what extent the international community copes \nwith threats to peace and with open-ended, prolonged \ndisputes. The Organization and its States Members are \nright to be satisfied with the body of work produced \nsince then to help maintain security and peace. The \n\n\n\f\nUnited Nations has proven to be an instrument that, \nsince the Second World War, has made international \nrelations more civilized in very many areas, not just \nin relations among countries but also within them. \nUnderstandably, the world is still far from ideal, but we \nshould not lose heart. A better world is possible, and \nwe should not lose sight of that. That is the real ideal \noutlined in the Charter of the United Nations, and it \nis a duty that belongs to all of us, the Members of the \nOrganization.\n\nThe justified satisfaction with the progress made, \nwhich was ensured with the aid of the United Nations \nand enjoyed by the whole of humankind, cannot hide the \nweaknesses of the Organization and its ineffectiveness \nin situations it was set up to resolve. \n\nOne such current situation is the civil war in Syria. \nThat conflict has led to a large number of victims and \nhas created a major humanitarian crisis. It is a threat \nto regional security and stability. In such situations, \nMembers of the Organization are authorized to \ndemand efficient action by the Security Council. That \nis a justified expectation of ours based on Article 24 \nof the Charter. Regrettably, we must conclude that in \nthe Syrian dispute, members of the Security Council \nhave spoken out for individual sides in the war and \nsupported them in various ways, rather than make the \nparties stop fighting and commit to peace talks. That \nhas revealed the lack of capacity and efficiency of the \ndecision-making mechanisms of the United Nations.\n\nThisis all the more reason not to procrastinate or \nwait for another anniversary as a pretext to return to our \nefforts to reform the Security Council in a way that would \nalso bolster its authority, legitimacy, representativeness \nand effectiveness. We are talking about a more systemic \nsolution that would not limit the Security Council \nbut would go beyond the Council by reinforcing its \nrepresentativeness. We are thinking today about the \nsignificance of the original principle of the right to veto \nof the Security Council\u2019s permanent members, in the \nlight not just of current or future challenges but also of \nthe changes in the global international order, which are \nunfolding before our very eyes. It would be beneficial \nif the discussion about those issues could follow a \nformula similar to the one that proved successful prior \nto the sixtieth anniversary of the Organization, which \nbrought about a rather ambitious reform agenda for the \nOrganization, some of which found its way into the \nWorld Summit Outcome adopted by Member States in \n2005 (resolution 60/1). Poland was an active participant \nin that work and intends to continue its engagement for \nfurther necessary reforms.\n\nThe Syrian tragedy, including the use of chemical \nweapons, is symbolic of a broader phenomenon \u2014 the \nignoring of international values, norms and obligations \nadopted by the Organization and the entire international \ncommunity. After all, they should apply to everybody to \nthe same degree, with no one set outside or above them. \nToo often, the immediate national interests of countries \nhave the upper hand. That leads to tragic consequences \nin terms of human rights and humanitarian issues, \nincluding the principle of the responsibility to protect, \nfor which we had such high hopes when it was adopted \nin 2005. \n\nArmed conflicts are an extreme manifestation of the \nmass violation of human rights. The tragic development \nof the situation in Syria, which has claimed more than \n100,000 victims by now, could have been prevented, \nespecially if the Security Council had adopted the \nnecessary decisions early enough. Therefore, the \nsolution of the difficult, complex and interrelated \nproblems of the Middle East entails a comprehensive, \nimaginative and impartial approach.\n\n\n\nIn a context where everyone is focused on security \nissues \u2014 including new, non-traditional ones, and \nwhere the dominant concerns are the economy. crisis \nmitigation, the fight for growth and competitiveness, \ncompetition for markets and land that could provide \nvaluable raw materials for economic development \u2014 we \ncannot forget about human rights. Recently, many actors \nin the international arena have failed to care about \nthem. But is it possible for us to ignore them, when, for \ninstance, the violations are too close to genocide? \n\nLet me remind the Assembly that this year, on \n9 December, we will be celebrating the sixty-fifth \nanniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the \nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, \nwhich was, by the way, initiated and drafted by the \nPolish lawyer Raphael Lemkin. The message from his \nresearch and initiatives, which started in Warsaw in the \nearly 1930s, is as follows: we must be alert and sensitive \nto the symptoms of future violations of human rights; it \nis our duty to respond to them and not just show moral \noutrage. \n\nAs the effectiveness of the response depends on \ninternational cooperation, the United Nations is to be \n\n\n\f\na centre for such international cooperation. The United \nNations is the best, and often the only, such centre. We \nmust not allow the instruments for the protection of \nhuman rights developed by the United Nations to be \neroded. Their effectiveness will depend upon whether \nwe remain united, and not just in name. It is necessary \nto establish a mechanism that would, in an objective and \nuncontroversial manner, force harmonious cooperation \nbetween the permanent members of the Security Council \nin the face of situations that fall under the principle of \nthe responsibility to protect, in order to ensure that the \nprevention of such crimes and the effective response to \nthem prevail over individual geopolitical interests.\n\nThe practice of exploiting children in armed \nconflicts is particularly saddening and causes a lot of \noutcry. The fact that many Governments tolerate such \npractices and that the Organization, despite existing \nconventions and protocols, is unable to do more in \nthis area is unacceptable. Let me remind the Assembly \nthat the Convention on the Rights of the Child was \nalso developed on Poland\u2019s initiative. For children, \ntheir safety, development and rights, it is the family \nthat matters most. Looking at the family and its role \nin society makes us aware of how much the family \nmeans when it comes to respecting human rights. We \nare particularly sensitive to that in Poland.\n\nWhat in many countries is a tangible but slight \ndeficit in the exercise of economic and social rights, \nwhile in many others it is poverty and chronic \nunderdevelopment. Poverty and underdevelopment are \nnot just human rights issues and factors that undermine \nthe dignity of the individual and entire social groups. \nThey are also the reason that individuals and nations \nare unable to ensure survival on their own, or to fulfil \ntheir creative potential for their own benefit and that of \nhumankind. That is why international efforts aimed at \nhelping regions and countries that suffer poverty and are \nconstantly underdeveloped are so important for them to \nbe able to take the path of sustainable growth and stop \nbeing chronically dependent upon external assistance. \nFirst and foremost, however, that is necessary so that \nfundamental human rights are respected and local \nresidents regain their sense of dignity in order for their \ninherent potential to serve the development and enrich \nthe diversity of the human civilization.\n\nThose objectives will be served by the climate \nnegotiations that Poland is going to chair when the \nnineteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to \nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange takes place in November. \n\nWe know in Poland that just one single generation \ncan be enough to make unbelievable progress. When \ncommunism fell in 1989, Poland was a poor country, \neconomically ruined and badly indebted. It needed \ninternational aid, not in the form of non-repayable \nborrowing but debt relief and restructuring, technical \nand training assistance, access to markets of better \ndeveloped countries and foreign investment. \n\nCoupled with the hard-working nature and \nentrepreneurial spirit of the Poles, that has all borne \nfruit in abundance. Since then, our gross domestic \nproduct has increased by approximately 400 per cent, \nwhile our emissions have dropped by more than 30 per \ncent, as compared with the baseline year. That attests \nto the fact that it is possible and realistic to achieve \neconomic growth while curbing the growth of harmful \nemissions. \n\nObviously, we are aware that there is no single \nformula for everyone and no single path to sustainable \ngrowth. There are different baseline circumstances, \nenvironments and cultural and geographical conditions. \nThe Polish example, however, and that of other post-\nCommunist countries, should be considered in other \nregions of the globe. \n\nThe same is true for the European development \nmodel of the European Union, which strives to \ncombine democracy and human freedom, economic \ncompetitiveness, social justice and solidarity. It is \nnot about being Eurocentric. It is an experience most \nappreciated by those who come to Europe from the \nfurthest parts of the world and want to stay there. Do \nnot be misled by the economic crisis in the European \nUnion, which most countries in the Union are already \nbeginning to overcome. The European development \nmodel remains universally attractive. \n\nOur experience also suggests that even the most \ngenerous foreign assistance will not replace efforts \nmade internally by a country. It is frequently an \nindispensable precondition, yet is insufficient in \nitself. Internal efforts and factors \u2014 the freedom and \nempowerment of individuals, economic freedom and \nthe stability of the State \u2014 always form the foundation. \n\nGood governance is another important aspect \nof successfully pursuing sustainable growth, as it \ncombines democracy, self-government, human rights, \n\n\n\f\ncompetence, a lack of corruption and the primacy of \nthe interest of the country as a whole over particular \ninterests, whether they are political or economic. The \nentire notion of good governance is spelled out in a \nresolution of the Human Rights Commission initiated \nby Poland in the late 1990s. Only with good governance \nin place can international aid bring about desirable \nresults in combating poverty and taking the route of \nsustainable growth.\n\nPoland is an active participant in the international \ncommunity, and not just through its bilateral relations \nand membership regional organizations such as the \nEuropean Union, or supra-regional ones such as NATO \nand the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope. We are also trying to create a better international \norder by being active in the United Nations. Poland, an \nunflinching believer in the purposes and principles of \nthe United Nations, is convinced that it is necessary \nto respect the treaties and commitments made by the \nOrganization \u2014 by us \u2014 and supports institutions and \nprogrammes that facilitate their implementation. \n\nFor years, one of the priorities of our policy has been \nthe promotion of human rights and democracy. Poland \ncurrently holds the presidency of the Human Rights \nCouncil. The European Endowment for Democracy was \nestablished on Poland\u2019s initiative as well. Our country\u2019s \nshare in development aid is growing, particularly \nwithin the European Union. Next November, Warsaw \nwill host the climate summit, where we will preside \nover the most important development process, namely, \nthat of climate-related negotiations.\n\nPoland has always been active in efforts aimed \nat ensuring the non-proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction, particularly chemical weapons. \nDrawing on our experience and rich relations with \nother countries, we wish to continue to contribute to \nreinforcing international peace and security. That is \nwhy we are seeking a seat on the Security Council for \nthe period 2018-2019. We believe that as a member of \nthe Security Council, we will be able to help achieve \nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations, as \nwell as represent the interests of Member States in line \nwith the letter and spirit of the Charter of the United \nNations.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I offer my \ncondolences to the families whose loved ones died as \na result of the terrorist attack on a shopping mall in \nKenya. Having suffered many terrorist attacks over \nnearly three decades, we Sri Lankans condemn this \ncowardly act.\n\nThe United Nations has consistently ensured \ncooperation among States and provided a universal \n\n\n\f\nplatform for discussions on a range of issues, contentious \nor otherwise. It is imperative that we jealously protect \nand abide by the principle of equal treatment of countries \nthat has been the very basis of this global Organization. \nBe it on economic or political issues, equality must \nform the bedrock of all international interactions.\n\nReflecting on the work of the United Nations, we \nnote that matters of a political nature have overridden \nthe most basic issues that affect the underprivileged \nand marginalized who make up the majority of \nworld society. The commitment to the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) brought about a real sense \nof optimism. The theme for this session is timely, as \nprogress in the MDGs should be evaluated, with their \ndeadline fast approaching.\n\nAppreciable progress has been made in the MDGs, \nalthough the results are uneven among and within \ncountries. According to World Bank projections, by \n2015 sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia will be home \nto approximately 40 per cent of the developing world\u2019s \npopulation living in extreme poverty. This diminishes \nour sense of optimism. It is fitting for the United \nNations system to examine the causes of the failure in \nimproving the lot of the deprived.\n\nIn the context of Sri Lanka, my vision has been to \ndistribute the benefits of growth across all segments \nof the population and to prevent inequalities, social \nexclusion and adverse environmental effects. The \nsocioeconomic achievements in my country are the \nresult of people-centric Government policies.\n\nDespite the fact that my country has had to \ncontend with one of the most ruthless terrorist groups \nin the world, the 2004 tsunami and the global food, \nenergy and financial crises, Sri Lanka\u2019s attainment \nof the MDGs is exemplary. The statistics speak for \nthemselves. Sri Lanka was ranked ninety-second out of \n187 countries in the 2012 Human Development Index. \nAbsolute poverty in Sri Lanka declined to 6.5 per cent \nin 2012 from 15.2 per cent over a period of five years, \nsurpassing the MDG mid-term target.\n\nThe goal of universal primary education will be \neasily achieved by 2015. The key dividend from this \nstrong educational infrastructure has been a drastic \nreduction in the unemployment level. Sri Lanka\u2019s \naccomplishments in health care include an infant \nmortality rate of 9.4 per 1,000 live births, highlighted \nby UNICEF as a success story.\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s sense of pride in our early recognition \nof the crucial role women play in political and \nsocioeconomic development is amply warranted, as we \nelected the world\u2019s first female Prime Minister, the late \nMrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Sri Lanka was ranked \nsixteenth in the Global Gender Gap Report 2010.\n\nSri Lanka has mainstreamed the issue of youth in \nits post-2015 development agenda and is at the forefront \nof international efforts advocating the interests of \nyouth. Sri Lanka will be hosting the Commonwealth \nYouth Forum 2013 in November and the United Nations \nWorld Conference on Youth in May 2014. I take this \nopportunity to extend an invitation to all Member States \nto join in celebrating youth at the World Conference. \n\nI also call upon the United Nations to declare an \ninternational skills day as recognition of the way in \nwhich skills development for youth paves the way for \nreduced poverty. An innovative development has been \nthe establishment of a Youth Parliament to sharpen \nthe awareness of democracy and skills among the new \ngeneration and prepare them to assume leadership.\n\nIt is of the utmost importance that Member States \nindividually decide on their own means to achieve \nthe MDGs. The unique sociocultural practices and \ntraditions of countries should be taken into account \nwhen designing these processes.\n\nThe post-2015 development agenda needs to be an \nintergovernmental process, in line with the outcomes \nand agreed principles of the United Nations Conference \non Sustainable Development (Rio+20). Centuries of \ngrowth in advanced economies have left little carbon \nspace for the developing world, thus challenging their \ngrowth. The thin line on which economic development \nand protection of the environment must be balanced \nwill remain a great challenge in future development \npolicy-setting. It is therefore critical that developed \ncountries honour their commitments and compensate \nfor their damage to the environment on the basis of \ncommon but differentiated responsibilities.\n\nThe eradication of poverty must be the primary \ngoal of the post-2015 development agenda and must \npromote accelerated economic growth in developing \ncountries. Ensuring sustainable growth with social \nequity demands a balanced approach to development. \nHigh rates of investment, efforts to strengthen the \nquality of human capital and technology transfers are \ncrucial for sustainable growth.\n\n\n\f\nThe mechanisms on financing and technology \nmandated by Rio+20 need to be urgently implemented. \nThe sustainable development financing strategy, in its \nformulation, must seek to provide for enhanced and \npredictable financial support to developing countries. \nSri Lanka supports the establishment of a technology \nfacilitation mechanism under the United Nations, \nrecommended in the Secretary-General\u2019s report \n(A/67/348). The mighty advocates of rights-based \napproaches should also honour their international \ncommitments relating to development financing.\n\nCalls for reforms in the current international \nfinancial institutions continue to be relevant. Their ad \nhoc policies have proven to be untenable in the long \nrun. It is imperative for the international monetary and \nfinancial institutions to give expression to the solid \nvoice of the developing world. Also, those countries that \nare economically blessed must shed their practice of \nleveraging through those institutions. A comprehensive \nstructural reform of the existing imperfect global \neconomic order needs to be fully addressed to reflect \ncurrent realities.\n\nThe world is in need of a fair international economic \nsystem to revitalize partnerships for development. \nThat includes State and non-State actors and blue \nchip companies emerging as new partners. Moreover, \nSouth-South cooperation is crucial due to the shift in \neconomic power and should be actively promoted to \ncomplement North-South cooperation.\n\nIt is disturbing to observe the growing trend in \nthe international arena of interference by some in the \ninternal matters of developing countries in the guise \nof ensuring security and guarding human rights. \nTherefore, we continue to witness agitation the world \nover, leading to violence and forcing political change \naccompanied by turmoil. It is time to contemplate \nwhether such movements have led to better stability \nin those countries or produced different results due \nto inappropriate external factors. In fact, the positive \noutcomes envisaged by those responsible have not \ncome to pass, but indeed contributed to making those \ncountries unstable. Do unilateral or group actions not \nerode the authority of the Security Council?\n\nThat trend needs to be arrested, as it has now \nextended into areas where it is detrimental to the well-\nbeing of populations. The turmoil results from attempts \nto impose a type of democracy upon countries with \nsignificantly different cultures, values and history. The \nworld needs no policing by a few States, particularly \nwhen the United Nations is mandated to ensure \ninternational security through multilateral engagement. \nThat engagement, to be complete in our time, must \nensure the protection of the human race against the \nflagrant abuse of modern science in such forms as \nnuclear and chemical weapons.\n\nDeepening uncertainties in the Middle East are \ndisturbing. We await the coexistence of Palestine and \nIsrael on the basis of pre-1967 borders. Sri Lanka looks \nforward to welcoming Palestine as a full Member of the \nUnited Nations.\n\nWe salute the people of Africa in their efforts \nto achieve better living conditions and economic \nprosperity. Sri Lanka continues to demonstrate \nsolidarity with the African people in their pursuit of \nfurther socioeconomic growth.\n\nUnilateral measures, such as embargoes and \neconomic sanctions imposed on countries, are \ndisturbing. Such initiatives bring suffering not only \nto those specifically targeted, but to a wide range of \nhumankind without any justification. Yet again, I \nstand in support of the people of Cuba in overcoming \neconomic hardships and in gaining full access to \neconomic opportunity.\n\nPermit me to address briefly the post-conflict \ndevelopments in my own country. I am proud that Sri \nLanka has eradicated separatist terrorism spanning \nthree decades and is in the process of addressing the \nissues of development and reconciliation. Sri Lanka\u2019s \nGovernment, at all times responsive to the priorities \nreflected in public opinion, is engaged in all measures \nrequired for meaningful progress in those fields.\n\nA significant event in that regard was the \nopportunity that the people of Northern province \nenjoyed at the elections, held three days ago, to elect \ntheir representatives in the provincial council. It is a \nmatter of legitimate satisfaction to me that this was \nmade possible after the lapse of almost a quarter of a \ncentury. There can be no doubt regarding the crucial \nimportance of that measure in the context of political \nempowerment and reconciliation. It is clearly the \nresponsibility of the international community to assist \nwith those efforts and to ensure their success for the \nbenefit of all the people of Sri Lanka.\n\nIn spite of the visible progress made and consistent \nengagement with United Nations mechanisms, \nmany countries are surprised at the disproportionate \n\n\n\f\nemphasis on Sri Lanka and its unequal treatment in the \nmultilateral framework. The basis for that relentless \npursuit is also questioned. It is my conviction that the \nUnited Nations system should be astute in ensuring the \nconsistency of standards applied so that there is no room \nfor suspicion of manipulation of the United Nations \nsystem by interested parties to fulfil their agendas.\n\nBy nature, human beings have the capacity to \nachieve the most challenging and noble goals in life \nthrough strong commitment and dedication. I am \nconfident that, by our own collective efforts, those \nresults will prove to be beneficial to all humankind. \nAs Buddha, the Enlightened One, said, \u201cAtta hi attano \nnatho\u201d \u2014 \u201cYou are your own master.\u201d Let those timeless \nwords of wisdom guide the destiny of the world. May \nthe Noble Triple Gem bless us all. \n"

        "file_text": "First of all, on behalf of the delegation of \nthe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, allow me \nto congratulate Mr. John William Ashe on his election \nas the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\neighth session. I am convinced that his competent \nleadership will lead this session towards success.\n\nThe Millennium Summit, held in 2000, advanced \npeace and security, sustainable development and the \nprotection and promotion of human rights as the three \nkey objectives of the United Nations. Ever since the \ninception of the United Nations, humankind has aspired \nto build a new, peaceful world, free from war, while at \nthe same time aspiring to achieve common prosperity \nand development based on cooperation among Member \nStates. That aspiration, however, is far from coming \ntrue, even after a new century and the passage of the \nfirst decade of the new millennium.\n\nA high-handed and arbitrary approach is \nbecoming ever more rampant in international relations. \nInfringements upon sovereignty, interference in internal \naffairs and regime change continue unabated under \nthe pretexts of non-proliferation and the protection of \nhuman rights, for which the United Nations is being \nabused. Confrontation between forces with different \ninterests, States and civilizations, and wars large and \nsmall, keep taking place in different parts of the world, \nseverely damaging the credibility of the United Nations, \nwhose primary mission is to ensure peace and security.\n\nThose developments clearly demonstrate that \nsustainable development and the real protection of \nhuman rights will remain a figment of our imagination \nas long as there is no peace and security as stipulated in \nthe Charter of the United Nations. International relations \nshould reject any State\u2019s high-handed and arbitrary \napproach on the part of a State that undermines peace \nand security in order to achieve genuine cooperation \nand development among countries based on the \nsovereign equality of States. The unjust intervention, \npressure and use of force that is unfolding in Syria by \nway of infringements on its sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity, which further breach peace and stability, \nshould not be allowed under any circumstances, and the \nUnited States blockade against Cuba should be brought \nto an end at the earliest possible date.\n\nThe international community unanimously \ndemands the elimination of all nuclear weapons and \nencourages the building of a nuclear-weapon-free world \nthrough nuclear disarmament. As agreed at a High-\nlevel Meeting on Nuclear Disarmament held during the \ncurrent session, on the initiative of the Non-Aligned \nMovement, negotiations on nuclear disarmament should \nbegin without further delay to work on universal legal \ninstruments that codify negative security assurances \nand the prohibition of nuclear weapons, among other \nthings.\n\nThe choice of \u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: \nsetting the stage\u201d as the theme for the current session \nserves to highlight the importance of sustainable \ndevelopment for world peace and our common prosperity. \nWe have little time left before the 2015 deadline for the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals, \n\n\n\f\nincluding poverty reduction in particular. However, \nmuch to our regret, international efforts in that regard \nhave not produced the long-overdue results. By \nidentifying and successfully attaining the post-2015 \nsustainable development goals, practical measures \nneed to be taken to address issues such as establishing \nfair international economic relations, transferring \nenvironmentally sound technology to developing \ncountries and strengthening financial support.\n\nDespite international efforts towards the protection \nand promotion of human rights, high-handedness \nand double standards are becoming ever more visible \nin United Nations human rights forums, targeting \ndeveloping countries as selectively as in the past. \nPoliticization, selectivity and double standards should \nbe put to an end in such forums, and no one should be \nable to justify or allow the continuation of a situation \nwhere the human rights situation in some countries \nis either called into question or simply ignored in \naccordance with the political purpose and interests of \nthe West and Western values.\n\nThe reform of the United Nations is becoming an \nissue that brooks no further delay in achieving the \nmajor United nations goals to which I have referred in \nthe twenty-first century.\n\nIn addressing key international issues, the General \nAssembly should be empowered to have the final \nsay, since it represents the overall will of the entire \nmembership. In particular, Security Council resolutions \npertaining to peace and security, such as those on \nsanctions and the use of force, should be made effective \nonly under the authority and with the approval of the \nGeneral Assembly. Instances of the Council being \nabused by a certain State as a tool of strategic interest \nshould never go unchallenged.\n\nLast January, under the manipulation of the United \nStates, the forcible adoption of an unfair resolution on \nsanctions took place (Security Council resolution 2087 \n(2013)) by making an issue of our legitimate satellite \nlaunch for peaceful purposes \u2014 something that was \nconducted and recognized under international law. \nThat represents a typical example of how and for what \npurpose the power of the Security Council is being \nabused. The reform of the Council, which is a key \ncomponent of reforming the United Nations, should \nbe undertaken on the basis of principles for ensuring \naccountability, transparency and impartiality in its \nactivities, thereby ensuring the full representation of \ndeveloping countries in its composition.\n\nToday in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea, the entire population is engaged in an all-out \ncampaign to build a thriving socialist State in the \nnearest possible future, under the wise leadership of \nthe dear respected Marshal Kim Jong Un. Marshal \nKim Jong Un, the supreme leader of our people, gives \ncontinuous on-the-spot guidance across the country, \noffering direction and innovative ways for speeding \nup economic development and the improvement of \npeople\u2019s livelihoods.\n\nPractical measures are being taken, one after \nanother, to revitalize the overall national economy, \nbringing about success in the fields of economic \ndevelopment and improving people\u2019s welfare. Nothing \nis more precious than creating a stable and peaceful \nenvironment for the Government of the Democratic \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Korea and the Korean people, \nwho helped build economic power and improved \npeople\u2019s livelihoods as part of the Government\u2019s \noverall objective. Although our efforts for peaceful \ndevelopment are faced with grave challenges, the \nKorean people will surely bring about the day of \nfinal victory by advancing with full confidence and \noptimism, united single-handedly around Marshal Kim \nJong Un and under his wise leadership.\n\nSixty years have passed since the gunfire that \nended a fierce three-year-long war and the signing \nof the Armistice Agreement in the Korean peninsula \nlast century. Yet there is still no mechanism in place \nto guarantee peace, resulting in the continuation of \nthe unsustainable situation \u2014 one of neither war nor \npeace \u2014 on the Korean peninsula.\n\nWith the aim of achieving military domination of \nNorth-East Asia, the United States, using the Korean \npeninsula as a stepping stone, has designated the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea as its primary \ntarget of attack and is beefing up its military presence \nin South Korea and the vicinity. Furthermore, it stages a \nseries of war exercises against the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea every year, with massive build-ups \nof hundreds of thousands of troops and modern military \nequipment, continuously escalating confrontation and \nfuelling tensions.\n\nThe United Nations Command, the outdated legacy \nof the Korean War, continues to serve the United States \nmilitary strategy by abusing the name of the United \nNations. The United Nations Command, which has \nnothing to do with the United Nations, continuously \nconducts military actions threatening the Korean \n\n\n\f\npeninsula and its surrounding area in the name of the \nUnited Nations under the baton of the United States. That \nshows that resolution 3390 (XXX), which the Assembly \nadopted at its thirtieth session and which calls for the \ndissolution of the United Nations Command, remains \nnothing more than a piece of paper. It also shows to \nwhat extent the credibility of the United Nations has \nbeen undermined.\n\nThe repeated vicious cycle of mounting tensions on \nthe Korean peninsula has its roots in the hostile policy \nof the United States towards the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea. The United States designated \nthe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, with its \ndifferent ideology and system, as its enemy from the \nvery day of its foundation and has refused to recognize \nits sovereignty and has imposed all sorts of sanctions, \npressure and military threats on the Democratic People\u2019s \nRepublic of Korea for more than half a century.\n\nThe only way to ensure lasting peace on the \nKorean peninsula is to bring the hostile United States \npolicy to an end. The United States should abolish its \nhostile policy by, among other things, respecting the \nsovereignty of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea, replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace \nmechanism, dismantling the United Nations Command \nwithout further delay and lifting all sanctions and \nmilitary threats.\n\nThe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea \nremains consistent in its stance and in its efforts to \nput an end to the tensions on the Korean peninsula by \npeaceful means through dialogue and negotiations, \nand to contribute to ensuring peace and security in \nthe region. In order to achieve genuine peace and ease \ntensions on the Korean peninsula, we are making every \npossible effort and displaying maximum patience.\n\nReunifying the country is a long-cherished desire \nand the most pressing task of the Korean nation. As \nwe entered the new century, North-South summit \nmeetings were held on two occasions, with joyful \nenthusiasm shared by all our countrymen, adopting \nthe 15 June North-South joint declaration and the \n4 October declaration, thus providing a milestone for \nreconciliation, collaboration and reunification between \nthe North and South of Korea.\n\nThanks to the active and generous efforts of the \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, a window of \nopportunity has opened for improving North-South \nrelations after a long period of deadlock. However, the \noutdated confrontational approach we are coming up \nagainst from the South Korean authorities risks driving \nrelations back into a destructive stage.\n\nAs clarified by the 15 June joint declaration and \nthe 4 October declaration, the only way to achieve the \npeaceful reunification of the country and to open the \nway forward for the nation is to promote dialogue and \ncooperation between the North and South of Korea by \njoining hands in the spirit of the Korean nation itself.\n\nWe will work hand in hand with anyone who \ntruly seeks reconciliation and the reunification and \nprosperity of the nation. We will strive to accomplish \nthe historic cause of national reunification through the \nconcerted efforts of the nation under the 15 June joint \ndeclaration and the 4 October declaration.\n\nIn conclusion, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of \nKorea will continue to strengthen and develop friendly \nand cooperative relations with all States Members of \nthe United Nations, support the placing of the situation \non the Korean peninsula under stable management as \na member of the international community, and fully \nexercise its responsibility and role in ensuring world \npeace and the common prosperity of humankind, \npursuant to its foreign policy of ideals, independence, \npeace and friendship.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, allow me to express our sincere gratitude \nfor the honour of addressing the General Assembly from \nthis rostrum. I bring greetings from His Excellency \nMr. Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, President of \nTurkmenistan, who wishes the General Assembly the \nbest of luck at this session. I congratulate Mr. John \nWilliam Ashe on his election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session and wish him all \nthe best in fulfilling his forthcoming tasks. I would also \nlike to thank Mr. Vuk Jeremi., President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session, for his skill and \neffectiveness in that post.\n\nTurkmenistan considers this session to be an \nimportant phase in the process of consolidating the \nefforts of the international community to strengthen \nuniversal peace, stability and security by adopting \nmeaningful decisions on sustainable development and \nto counter emerging challenges and threats. We believe \nthat strict adherence to the principles and norms of the \nCharter of the United Nations is the main prerequisite \nfor ensuring long-term peace and strategic stability.\n\nIn that belief, Turkmenistan adheres to a steady \nand resolute policy of peace, good-neighbourliness and \nthe active promotion of peacebuilding processes. As a \nmatter of principle, we reject the use of military force as \na tool of foreign policy and international relations. Our \ncountry is convinced that solutions based on the use \nof force are doomed to fail. They neither eliminate the \ncauses of conflicts nor create conditions for adequate \nresponses to the many issues that arise from military \naction. Therefore, at the heart of Turkmenistan\u2019s policies \nis the will to resolve any situation by peaceful, political \nand diplomatic ways and means, which it considers to \nbe the main legitimate resources available within the \nUnited Nations. This approach is based on our common \ngoal to establish a world without conflict.\n\nAt the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly, \nTurkmenistan\u2019s President launched an initiative aimed \nat the adoption of a United Nations declaration on \nprioritizing political and diplomatic ways and means \nfor the resolution of international challenges. Today, \nthe elaboration of such a document has become a top \npriority. Turkmenistan therefore reaffirms its firm \ndesire to engage in a meaningful discussion on this \ninitiative with all interested Member States. We are \nconvinced that the adoption of such a declaration would \nhelp to expand and strengthen the legal basis for the \nwork of the General Assembly, the Security Council \nand other United Nations entities dealing with issues \nrelating to world peace, stability and security.\n\nThe challenging processes unfolding in today\u2019s \nworld call for a responsible, thoughtful, effective \nand efficient approach on the part of the United \nNations. That is also linked directly to the important \nchallenges of disarmament. By playing an active role \nin the multilateral dialogue on disarmament issues, my \nGovernment is demonstrating its firm commitment to \ncomplying with the core international norms regulating \nthe disarmament process and the non-proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction through practical \naction. Following this course of action and taking \ninto consideration the need to energize the discussion \nand meaningful consideration of disarmament issues, \nTurkmenistan proposes the convening in 2014 of a high-\nlevel international meeting on disarmament issues. \nWe are prepared to create all the necessary conditions \nand to provide the appropriate infrastructure for this \nmeeting in our capital city.\n\nNowadays, problems related to strengthening \npeace and stability and to ensuring the stability of \ncountries and nations are among the most important \ntopics in global politics. Their resolution will depend \nprimarily on the establishment and effective legal \nand organizational operationalization of international \npolitical cooperation. In this context, we advise the \nGeneral Assembly at this session to embark on the \nconsideration of issues relating to the improvement of \nvarious forms of multilateral interaction that could serve \nas a political platform for finding mutually acceptable \ndecisions on urgent regional and international policy \nmatters.\n\nIt should be noted in that regard that the \nUnited Nations fulfils its purpose. For example, the \nestablishment of United Nations preventive diplomacy \ncentres in various regions of the world has become a \n\n\n\f\nhighly effective form of joint work to strengthen security, \nprevent conflicts and eliminate their underlying causes. \nIt is well known that the first such centre, the United \nNations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy in \nCentral Asia, based in Ashgabat, opened in December \n2007. In our view, the experience of creating new \nmechanisms and institutions aimed at forming a system \nof international interaction at the global and regional \nlevels must and should be replicated by States Members \nof the United Nations.\n\nTaking into account the need to enhance the \neffectiveness of inter-State contact at the regional \nlevel, Turkmenistan has launched a forum of peace \nand cooperation, aimed at establishing a standing \nmechanism for political dialogue in Central Asia. \nWe believe that the forum will contribute to the \nelaboration of consensus-based approaches to finding \nsolutions to the most important issues relating to the \npresent and future development of Central Asia and \nits neighbouring regions. Moreover, the forum could \nbecome the basis for the establishment of a consultative \ncouncil of the Heads of State of Central Asia. We are \nconvinced that the development of new formats for \npolitical interaction among States within the region, \ncoupled with the effective functioning of United \nNations regional structures, will provide a reliable \nfoundation and stability for the entire architecture of \ninter-State relations in Central Asia.\n\nTo a great extent, attaining the goals of \ncomprehensive and universal security will depend on \nensuring security in the sphere of energy. Furthermore, \nthe achievement of that goal is one of the most \nimportant components of a stable world economy and \nserves to protect it against distortions and disruptions. \nIn that connection, the development of an international \nmechanism that provides for a set of guarantees for the \nglobal energy supply is a task of paramount importance. \nIt is also necessary to underscore the importance of \nthe joint work and coordinated efforts of all Member \nStates aimed at developing and adopting consolidated \napproaches to the solution of energy security issues.\n\nThe establishment by the United Nations of a new \nuniversal international legal tool kit is a key element \nof that process. It should, in our view, consist of the \nfollowing three major elements: a multilateral United \nNations document providing the legal basis for \nrelations in the area of the global supply of energy \nresources; a corresponding United Nations structure \nthat would ensure the implementation of the provisions \nof the aforementioned document; and an international \ndatabase designed for the collection and analysis of \ndata on the implementation of international obligations \nassumed by the participating States.\n\nIt is common knowledge that on 17 May 2013 the \nGeneral Assembly adopted by consensus resolution \n67/263, submitted on the initiative of Turkmenistan\u2019s \nPresident, entitled \u201cReliable and stable transit of energy \nand its role in ensuring sustainable development and \ninternational cooperation\u201d. The importance of that \ndocument lies primarily in the fact that it forms the \nbasis for a global energy partnership that takes into \naccount the interests of producer States, transit States \nand States that are consumers of energy resources.\n\nIn accordance with the letter and the spirit of that \nresolution, our country proposes to Member States \nthe establishment, during the current session of the \nAssembly, of an international group of experts for the \ndevelopment of a new mechanism for energy security. \nTo that end, the Government of Turkmenistan proposes \nto convene an international meeting of experts on \nthat topic in 2014. We are ready to engage in close \ncooperation with all Member States and the United \nNations Secretariat with a view to organizing and \nholding such a forum.\n\nCurrently the resolution of issues of security and \nsustainable development depends largely on the level \nof international cooperation in the important areas of \ntransport and communications. The geo-economic \npotential of new transport and transit routes in the \nworld is enormously significant. Such routes involve \nvast spaces and enormous human resources and \nattract considerable investments. All of that creates \nopportunities to transform the transport sector into \none of the most important factors in sustainable \ndevelopment.\n\nTurkmenistan is convinced that the twenty-first-\ncentury transportation architecture provides the \nframework for a breakthrough in integration, in joining \nthe common efforts of regions and in the pooling of \nresources and industrial and human potential. It is \nour firm conviction that the future belongs to such \na combined system of transport communication, \ninvolving major international and regional maritime, \nroad, railroad and air hubs, their optimal integration \nand the use of their specific advantages.\n\nThe practical implementation of that idea \nbecame the subject of a high-level event on modality, \n\n\n\f\ninterconnectivity and the post-2015 development \nprogramme, which was held in New York on \n26 September. It was organized by the Government of \nTurkmenistan and the International Road Transport \nUnion. The event focused on the search for effective \nsolutions relating to the establishment of modern, \ndiversified and safe transport infrastructure throughout \nthe world.\n\nWe consider it necessary to continue the multilateral \ndialogue on transport issues that was initiated during \nthe current session of the General Assembly. In that \nconnection, Turkmenistan would like to submit a \nproposal to host in 2014 in Ashgabat an international \nconference on the role of transport and transit corridors \nin ensuring international cooperation, stability and \nsustainable development.\n\nWith regard to the achievement of the sustainable \ndevelopment goals, we believe that the greatest attention \nshould be focused on promoting the economic interests \nof States, while maintaining an appropriate ecological \nbalance and preventing harm to the environment. That, \nin turn, implies the use of cutting-edge environmental \ntechnologies and the development of innovative \nsolutions for the preservation of nature. Preserving \nthe significant environmental component of the global \neconomic space has therefore become an integral part \nof its effectiveness.\n\nWe highly value the efforts undertaken by the \nSecretary-General, as well as the successive actions \nof the international community at the United Nations \nClimate Change Conferences in Copenhagen and \nCancun and during the seventeenth Conference of the \nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change, held in Durban, which have \ngradually laid the foundations for the development \nof comprehensive decisions at the United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development.\n\nWe look forward to the continuation of a constructive \ninternational dialogue on that topic during the sixty-\neighth session of the Assembly. We are convinced that \nit is necessary to combine our efforts in that area at \nthe international, regional and national levels, and to \neffectively coordinate the efforts of States with those of \nthe United Nations.\n\nTaking into account the numerous aspects of the \nclimate change issue, Turkmenistan wishes to state at the \ncurrent session of the General Assembly that it stands \nready to make its contribution to the strengthening of the \nrole of multilateral international mechanisms aimed at \npreventing the negative consequences of global climate \nchange. In particular, we refer to the need for enhancing \nthe implementation of the provisions of the United \nNations Convention to Combat Desertification. In that \nconnection, we are prepared to host in Turkmenistan \nthe Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \nConvention to Combat Desertification in 2014.\n\nFurthermore, our country would like to launch an \ninitiative aimed at the establishment of a specialized \nentity, a subregional centre on technologies relating \nto climate change in Central Asia and the Caspian Sea \nbasin. We believe that such an entity would help the \ncountries of our regions to substantially strengthen \ntheir interaction in the sphere of environmental security \nand would contribute to the effective coordination of \ninterregional efforts in that field.\n\nThe challenges confronting the community \nof nations in the area of security and sustainable \ndevelopment cannot be resolved unless we find a \nsolution to the humanitarian issues at the international \nlevel. In particular, we are referring to the serious global \nproblem of the fate of refugees and stateless persons. \nAs a permanent member of the Executive Committee of \nthe High Commissioner\u2019s Programme of the Office of \nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, \nTurkmenistan has accumulated valuable experience in \nresolving the issues facing people who were forced to \nleave their home countries. Together with the Office of \nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, \nwe propose that all interested parties become familiar \nwith Turkmenistan\u2019s practical work in granting \ncitizenship to refugees and stateless persons.\n\nIn that connection, it would be advisable to work \njointly with United Nations humanitarian agencies to \ndevelop an appropriate social programme. Moreover, \ntaking into account the outcomes of the International \nMinisterial Conference of the Organization of Islamic \nCooperation on Refugees in the Muslim World, held \nin Ashgabat in May 2012, we consider it necessary to \ndevelop long-term solutions to such issues, on the basis \nof generally recognized norms of international law. \nWith a view to discussing those issues, we are ready \nto host in Turkmenistan in 2014 a high-level event in \ncooperation with the Office of the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Refugees.\n\nToday, as Member States actively discuss the \nrole and place of the United Nations in international \n\n\n\f\nrelations, Turkmenistan declares that constructive and \nmultilateral cooperation with the United Nations is \nthe top priority of its foreign policy strategy. In that \nconnection, we believe that it is precisely the United \nNations that is the main and universal international \nOrganization, which adopts decisions concerning \nthe most important issues of global development and \ncomprehensive peace and security. Since its inception, \nthe United Nations has demonstrated its role as the \nfoundation of the entire system of international stability, \nthrough mechanisms to ensure justice and to resolve \nthe most complex international problems.\n\nSimilarly, we share the opinion of the Organization \ntoday that the issue of providing it with fresh impetus \nis increasingly relevant, in view of the rapidly changing \nrealities of the modern world. Therefore, Turkmenistan \nsupports a strengthened and expanded role for the \nUnited Nations at the global level.\n\nWe are firmly convinced that international \nlaw and the provisions of the Charter of the United \nNations \u2014 based on peace, equal rights and respect for \nnations, their rights and sovereignty \u2014 must remain \nthe foundation of the world order in the twenty-first \ncentury.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I wish to congratulate \nHis Excellency Mr. John. Ashe on his election as \nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth \nsession. I am confident that his wisdom and skill will be \nbrought to bear as he steers the Assembly through a year \nof progressive dialogue and challenging negotiations. \n\nThe theme of this year\u2019s session, \u201cThe post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage\u201d, is timely, as it \npresents an opportunity for us to discuss the future of \nglobal development. To that end, I wish to assure the \nPresident of our delegation\u2019s support as he discharges \nthe function of President at this session. \n\nThe African continent has this year also reached a \nsignificant milestone. In May, together with the rest of \nthe continent, we celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of \nthe founding of the Organization of African Unity, the \nforerunner to the African Union. The African Union \nis a symbol of the collective hopes and aspirations \nof our resilient continent. As expected, that occasion \nformed the basis for mutual reflection on the future \ndirection of a young and versatile Africa. Furthermore, \nnext year, our country will commemorate 50 years of \nits independence. We approach that milestone proud \nthat Zambia continues to enjoy political stability and \nhas embraced democratic principles that have formed \nthe basis for social and economic transformation for \nimproving the lives of the Zambian people.\n\nOur country is also honoured to have played a \nsignificant role in peacebuilding initiatives within \nthe subregion and the continent at large and continues \nto participate in them. Zambia will therefore remain \ncommitted to the ideals for which she has stood and \nis prepared to contribute to global efforts aimed at \nuplifting humanity.\n\nTo address the aspirations of our peoples, in \nparticular those of the most vulnerable nations, we \nas a global community meeting in this Assembly \nset ourselves the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs) \u2014 eight clear targets that resonate with our \npopulations\u2019 aspirations. In less than two years, we \nwill have reached the deadline for the attainment of the \nMDGs, and Governments will have an opportunity to \ntake stock of the achievements made in efforts to attain \nthe development targets set at the turn of the century.\n\nWe are all champions of the MDGs. We have run \nthe race, and we continue to run the race, albeit at \ndifferent paces and on different terrains. What remains \ncritical, therefore, is what we do between now and the \ndeadline, as well as how we will move beyond 2015.\n\nAmid much anxiety, the 2013 progress report for \nmy country was released in May. On a positive note, \nthe report indicated the tremendous progress made \nby Zambia on MDGs 4 and 5, regarding reducing the \nunder-five mortality rate by two thirds and the maternal \nmortality ratio by three quarters by 2015. I emphasize \nhere that maternal mortality is rooted in gender \ninequality, which manifests itself as poor education for \ngirls, early marriage, adolescent pregnancies and lack \nof access to sexual and reproductive health care. The \nresults therefore tell us that with more effort, gender \ninequality can be redressed.\n\nZambia\u2019s MDG report further indicates that we \nhave made great strides in the fight against HIV/AIDS. \nThe challenges are still immense, and we have to ensure \nthat those living with HIV and AIDS are receiving the \nbest care and access to social protection services. All \nefforts must be made to reach zero infection and zero \ndeaths by building on what has been achieved so far. \nInternational support is equally critical for a sustained \nand enhanced response.\n\nThe Zambian economy is presently enjoying \nmacroeconomic stability and has experienced \nappreciable economic growth over the recent past. \nHowever, our Government still has the huge task of \nensuring that the basic needs of Zambians are met, as \npoverty levels and unemployment remain a challenge. It \nis not surprising, therefore, that we have made marginal \nprogress in reducing the prevalence of hunger. In order \nto accelerate Zambia\u2019s efforts to achieve MDG 1, our \nGovernment has taken an unprecedented and painful \nstep in curtailing subsidies on fuel and maize. That \nhas enabled us to release much-needed resources for \nprogrammes that are deliberately targeted at poverty \nalleviation. We have also transformed and repositioned \nsocial protection services to optimize efficiency.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund and the World \nBank estimate that economic growth in sub-Saharan \nAfrica can be expected to be higher than the global \n\n\n\f\naverage \u2014 around 5.5 per cent in 2013 and 6.1 per \ncent next year. However, in the absence of inclusive \nsocial development and without food security, that \ngrowth risks being undermined by social exclusion, \nparticularly for the youth. For instance, while our \nGovernment recorded a growth in gross domestic \nproduct of 7.3 per cent in 2012, we recognize the fact \nthat it is equally important to ensure that we put in \nplace specific measures that will promote equality and \nsocial justice in the labour market. It is for this reason \nthat we are strongly advocating for investment that \ncreates real and sustainable employment prospects for \nour people, while at the same time making our economy \nmore labour-absorbent.\n\nIn turning to the post-2015 agenda, our Government \nbelieves that the importance of the intergovernmental \nprocesses on sustainable development goals is critical \nand cannot be overemphasized. I wish to reiterate \nthe need to have a single set of universally agreed \nsustainable development goals reflecting sustainable \ndevelopment priorities that are actionable and concise \nand whose implementation will resonate with the \ndifferent development and economic levels of Member \nStates. Furthermore, the goals will need to be prudently \nbalanced and to effectively integrate the economic, \nsocial and environmental aspects of sustainable \ndevelopment. To that end, it is necessary to build global \npartnerships that are supported by commitments to \nregional and international cooperation, anchored with \nmutual accountability, enhanced local private sectors \nand public-private partnerships.\n\nOur Government believes that addressing issues of \npoverty is important for the achievement of sustainable \nand inclusive development in the future we want for \nZambia. Our country attaches importance to improving \nthe welfare of our people, especially women, children \nand young people, through wealth and employment \ncreation, the provision of quality education and of \nquality health care, and industrialization, among other \nthings.\n\nIn particular, our Government wishes to emphasize \nthe need to mainstream children\u2019s issues, including \naccess to quality education and quality health care \nservices, provided at the right time. Social protection \nand upholding the rights of all children is critical and \nshould transcend the global desire for a better future. It \nis therefore imperative that the post-2015 agenda take \ninto account the momentum that has been attained in the \nrealization of the MDGs in order to ensure continuity \nand sustainability.\n\nMy address to the Assembly would be incomplete \nif I did not underscore Zambia\u2019s, and indeed Africa\u2019s, \ndesire to realize a more democratic and representative \nSecurity Council. As a continent, our voice could not \nbe clearer. We continue to call for greater progress in \nthose negotiations, whose conclusion is long overdue. I \nwish to reiterate our position, as defined in the Ezulwini \nConsensus. The United Nations boasts of an all-inclusive \nmultilateral process, but that is obviously lacking when \nit comes to the Security Council. The effectiveness of \nthat organ should be enhanced by adapting it to the \nprevailing global realities of international peace and \nsecurity and the legitimacy realized through an all-\ninclusive process.\n\nIn conclusion, allow me to express Zambia\u2019s \ngratitude for the support received in the recent hosting \nof two important United Nations conferences, namely, \nthe twentieth session of the General Assembly of the \nWorld Tourism Organization and the fourth Meeting of \nStates Parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions. \nI therefore take this opportunity, on behalf of my \nGovernment and the Zambian people, to thank all those \nwho participated and contributed to the success of \nthose meetings. We look forward to the opportunity to \nhost again in the near future.\n"

        "file_text": "The President of the General Assembly has chosen for \nthis session and this general debate the theme \u201cThe post-\n2015 development agenda: setting the stage\u201d. He has \nthus called on the Assembly to be bold and ambitious, \nto work together towards the same objective, to prove to \nthe world that we will not accept defeat, and to exert our \ncollective responsibility in order to eradicate poverty \nand promote sustainable development.\n\nLuxembourg stands ready to do so. We are ready \nto work towards a renewed global partnership based \non a common understanding of our shared humanity, \non a new spirit of solidarity, cooperation and mutual \naccountability, and on coordinated action that embraces \nsecurity, development, governance, human rights and \nthe rule of law.\n\nTo live free from fear, conflict and violence \nis the most fundamental human right, and yet we \nwitness unspeakable violations of human rights and \ninternational humanitarian law every single day. The \nuse of missiles, bombs, cluster munitions and chemical \nweapons, the systematic imposition of sieges, forced \ndisplacements, torture, sexual violence, violations \nand abuses committed against children, more than \n2 million refugees, more than 100,000 dead \u2014 these \nare the chilling results of two and a half years of brutal \nrepression and conflict in Syria. The list of war crimes \nand crimes against humanity committed on a daily \nbasis continues to grow. \n\nAgainst such horror, I repeat once again that the \nsituation in Syria must be referred to the International \nCriminal Court. Allow me to quote High Commissioner \nfor Refugees Ant\u00f3nio Guterres: \n\n\u201cSyria has become the great tragedy of this \ncentury \u2014 a disgraceful humanitarian calamity \nwith suffering and displacement unparalleled in \nrecent history\u201d. \nThe Syrian people need assistance now, and they \nhave the right to such assistance under the most basic \ncriteria codified in international humanitarian law. The \nSyrian authorities must urgently meet the demands of \n\n\n\f\nhumanitarian actors by immediately facilitating their \nfree and unimpeded access to the affected populations. \nIt is urgent to remove bureaucratic obstacles, to \nensure the delivery of medical supplies, to institute \nhumanitarian pauses, to open up humanitarian routes \nand to allow access to populations in need across \nborders and across conflict lines.\n\nAs a non-permanent member of the Security \nCouncil, Luxembourg is working with Australia to \namplify the demands of humanitarian actors to the \nparties to the conflict in Syria and to secure them in a \nunified message from the Security Council. I hope that \nthose efforts will come to fruition very soon.\n\nWhile we have been able to make progress in \npast few days on the issue of chemical weapons, and I \nhope we will adopt, a few hours from now a Security \nCouncil resolution establishing a strong and binding \nmechanism to ensure the control and destruction of \nthe Syrian chemical weapons as soon as possible. Yet \nwe cannot and must not forget the humanitarian crisis \nthat continues to unfold in Syria and its neighbouring \ncountries, particularly Lebanon and Jordan but also in \nIraq and Turkey. For its part, Luxembourg has fulfiled \nthe pledges it made in Kuwait City on 30 January last, \nand we have just decided to increase our humanitarian \naid to the populations affected by the Syrian crisis to \n\u20ac7.6 million.\n\nThe vigorous appeal made on Tuesday by the \nSecretary-General should resonate with all of us. Let us \nbreak our deafening silence and live up to our collective \nand individual responsibilities. We all agree that a \nlasting solution to the conflict in Syria can only be \npolitical. Here too, let us live up to our responsibilities; \nlet us seize the momentum created by the agreement \non chemical weapons, set a date for the \u201cGeneva II\u201d \nconference, and encourage the parties to participate \ntherein in order to start down a road, on the basis of \nthe Geneva communiqu\u00e9 of 30 June 2012 (S/2012/523, \nannex), leading to a cessation of hostilities and to a \nnecessary political transition in Syria that meets the \nlegitimate aspirations of the Syrian people.\n\nTragic as it may be, the situation in Syria must not \nlead us to forget the plight of the Palestinian people. \nWe must not forget the urgent need to see the creation \nof a contiguous and viable Palestinian State, living \nin peace and security, side by side with the State of \nIsrael. I welcome the commitment and resolve of the \nSecretary of State of the United States, John Kerry, \nto restart direct negotiations between the Israelis and \nPalestinians. I also praise the political courage and \nthe sense of responsibility shown by the Israeli and \nPalestinian authorities in accepting to return to the \nnegotiating table. Eight rounds have been held since \n14 August. We hope that the negotiations will intensify \nin October and lead to a result within the agreed time \nframe of nine months.\n\nWe all know that this initiative is probably our last \nopportunity to act. We must not let it slip away. If we do, \nit could lead to dramatic consequences. The time has \ncome to make difficult decisions, to take the necessary \nhistoric measures in line with the long-term interests of \nthe Israeli and Palestinian peoples. The time has come \nto implement the two-State solution. This is no time \nfor unilateral acts that fuel the dynamic of mistrust. \nBuilding illegal settlements and destroying Palestinian \nhomes and infrastructure in the West Bank, including \nin East Jerusalem, must stop immediately. The attacks \non Gaza must stop. All violence must stop.\n\nWith its partners in the European Union, \nLuxembourg stands ready to pursue its active \ncontribution to the ongoing efforts, in close cooperation \nwith key stakeholders, the Quartet and countries in the \nregion. There can be no security in Israel without a \nviable Palestinian State. There can be no security in \nthe region without peace in all countries of the Middle \nEast.\n\nWe must shake up the status quo. We must break \nthe cycle of violence. This imperative also applies to \nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Great \nLakes region. We dearly hope that the Peace, Security \nand Cooperation Framework for the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo and the Region, signed on \n24 February in Addis Ababa, represents a turning point \nfor consolidating peace and regional stability. The \nsecond meeting of the Regional Oversight Mechanism, \nheld at the level of the Heads of State and Government \non Monday in New York City, led to the adoption of \nregional benchmarks and indicators on progress, which \nwill facilitate the implementation of the Framework. \n\nThis is an important first step. It must be \nfollowed by concrete action at the political, security \nand economic levels. The parties must fulfil all their \ncommitments diligently and in good faith, including a \ncommitment neither to tolerate nor to provide assistance \nor support of any kind to armed groups, in particular \nthe Mouvement du 23 mars, which continues to operate \nin the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. We \nmust tackle the root causes of recurring violence and \n\n\n\f\nlay the foundation for reviving the regional economy \nin order to initiate a virtuous circle that will allow the \npeople of the region to start down the the path towards \nsustainable development.\n\nThe commitment of the international community is \nall the more necessary in a situation that, regrettably, \nhas received far less attention. I am referring to \nthe humanitarian tragedy unfolding in the Central \nAfrican Republic, affecting the entire population of \n4.6 million people. Law and order and the rule of law \nhave collapsed. Human rights violations have become \ncommonplace, as have arbitrary arrests and detention, \ntorture, sexual violence against women and children, \nrape and extrajudicial executions. According to our \nsources, S\u00e9l\u00e9ka militias have also recruited and used \nat least 3,500 child soldiers. No one can be indifferent \nto those figures. The humanitarian situation continues \nto deteriorate. The prevailing insecurity has further \nreduced access to the affected populations. We must act \nimmediately.\n\nRestoring security and law and order must be our \nfirst priority. We strongly welcome the decision of the \nAfrican Union Peace and Security Council to authorize \nthe deployment of an international support mission \nto the Central African Republic. The United Nations \nshould give its full logistical and financial support to \nthis African-led mission. Our credibility is at stake.\n\nWe all know the disastrous effects of the unregulated \ntrade in conventional arms \u2014 violent repression, armed \nconflict, crime and widespread violence. That is why \nthe Arms Trade Treaty is so important. The General \nAssembly adopted the Treaty by a very large margin \nfive months ago. Luxembourg is proud to have been \namong the first sponsors of that important initiative. \nWe are proud to have signed the Treaty as soon as it was \nready for signature on 3 June. The national ratification \nprocedure has started, and members can count on our \nsupport to ensure that the Treaty comes rapidly into \nfull force. In that regard, allow me to congratulate the \nhomeland of the President of the General Assembly, \nAntigua and Barbuda, on having ratified the Treaty. \nI also welcome the fact that more than 110 States \nMembers of the United Nations, including the United \nStates of America, have already signed this new legal \ninstrument. \n\nThe Arms Trade Treaty is a significant step forward \nfor international law, international humanitarian law \nand human rights. In that context, I welcome yesterday\u2019s \nimportant Security Council debate on the impact of the \nillicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse \nof small arms and light weapons on international peace \nand security (see S/PV.7036), as well as its adoption of \nresolution 2117 (2013). The Council has thereby rightly \nunderscored the need for an integrated response from \nthe international community that takes into account the \nnegative effects of those illicit activities on security, \ngovernance, the rule of law and development, as well \nas the links between such activities and other threats \nto international peace and security such as terrorism, \npiracy and transnational organized crime.\n\nThe recent callous attack on a shopping centre \nin Nairobi has again demonstrated the importance of \nour ongoing vigilance in the fight against terrorism. \nThis unacceptable act must encourage us to further \nsupport African efforts aimed at freeing Somalia from \nthe threat of Al-Shabaab. During the New Deal for \nSomalia conference held on 16 September in Brussels, \nI had the opportunity to reaffirm that Luxembourg \nremained committed to working alongside Somalia. \nWe are convinced that with the determined support of \nthe international community \u2014 the African Union and \nthe United Nations in particular, the Government and \npeople of Somalia will be able to continue their journey \ntowards peace, security and prosperity.\n\nThe risk of the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction remains just as real a threat as the threat of \nterrorism. Yesterday, negotiations between the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran and the E3+3 Governments, led by \nthe European Union\u2019s High Representative for Foreign \nAffairs and Security Policy, Ms. Ashton, resumed here \nin New York. We support those efforts. We seek solid \nnegotiations quickly leading to concrete outcomes and \na diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear crisis. \n\nSanctions are not in and of themselves an end. \nThey are a global response to Iran\u2019s refusal to meet its \ninternational obligations and to cooperate fully with the \nInternational Atomatic Energy Agency. We encourage \nthe new Iranian leadership to engage in constructive \ndialogue, to take the measures necessary to prove to the \ninternational community that its nuclear programme is \nintended for exclusively peaceful purposes, and to turn \na new leaf in its relations with the global community. \nI hope that the recent phone call between President \nObama and President Rouhani will help move the \nsituation in that direction. \n\nWhen we talk about sustainable development and \nthe creation of the post-2015 development agenda, we \ncannot ignore the devastating effects of conflicts and \n\n\n\f\nviolence on development. The crisis situations and \nthreats that I have just mentioned illustrate this clearly. \nWe must also speak firmly about governance that is \nconducive to development, institutions that guarantee \nthe rule of law, freedom of expression, and transparent \nand accountable Governments. We must talk about \njustice, the fight against impunity and respect for \ninternational law.\n\nLuxembourg fully subscribes to the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s call for the post-2015 objectives to be based \non the international norms and principles of human \nrights. Those objectives must apply to everybody and \nhelp address the global challenges of the twenty-first \ncentury, building on the Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs). They must contribute to eliminating \npoverty and promoting sustainable development, and \nbe integrated into one coherent framework. \n\nThe special event held the day before yesterday \nby the General Assembly allowed us to take stock of \nongoing work towards achieving the MDGs and to \nwelcome significant progress made, but also to identify \nthe sectors where it will be important to redouble our \nefforts. As the Secretary-General has reminded us, \nthe picture before us is only half finished. We must \ntherefore speed up the march towards attaining the \nMDGs. We must renew our commitment. We must keep \nour promises.\n\nMy country will continue to do its part. Since 2009, \nour official development assistance has amounted \nto 1 per cent of our gross national income. We are \ndetermined to maintain this effort despite the crisis. \n\nAt the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment in June 2012, we reaffirmed our \ncommitment to sustainable development in its three \ninterdependent dimensions: economic development, \nsocial inclusion and environmental sustainability. We \nreiterated our determination to address the threats that \nclimate change and environmental degradation pose to \nhumankind. With its European partners, Luxembourg \nhas made binding commitments to reduce its carbon \nemissions and to mitigate the effects of climate change. \nWe are resolved to do our all to achieve a universal \nclimate agreement in 2015.\n\nLast year in the Hall of the General Assembly, \nour Head of State, the Grand Duke, underscored \nLuxembourg\u2019s willingness to serve the United Nations \n(see A/67/PV.9). Today, I take this opportunity to thank \nthe Assembly for having elected my country to a two-\nyear term on the Security Council. That tenure, the first \nin our history, is not only an honour but a responsibility \nthat we do not take lightly. Each day since 1 January, \nLuxembourg has worked in concert with its partners \nto contribute to the maintenance of international peace \nand security and to assume our common responsibility \nto prevent, to preserve and to protect. No task is more \nnoble. No task is more urgent in the current context.\n\n"

        "file_text": "For the second time in my tenure as Prime Minister \nof Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, I have the \npleasure and honour to welcome a distinguished son \nof our Caribbean civilization to the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly. Even as we thank your immediate \npredecessor for his service as the President of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, we look \nforward to your tenure, President Ashe, with boundless \npride and unbridled optimism.\n\nMr. President, for this year\u2019s general debate, you \nhave chosen the theme \u201cThe post-2015 development \nagenda: setting the stage\u201d. This is also the year in which \nyou will lay the groundwork for the United Nations \nInternational Conference on Small Island Developing \nStates, which will take place in Samoa next September. \nYour dual focus on the international development \n\n\n\f\nagenda and the peculiarities of small island States make \nthis sixty-eighth session one of the most important in \nmy country\u2019s 33 years of membership in the United \nNations.\n\nLet me first say that the people of Saint Vincent and \nthe Grenadines are deeply pained at the horrendous acts \nof terrorism recently committed in Kenya. I reaffirm \nyet again our solidarity with the Government and the \npeople of Kenya.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare cautioned that what is past, \nis prologue. Similarly, Mr. President, your invitation \nto consider the future of the international development \nagenda requires us to first consider the ways in which \nour recent and long-ago steps and missteps shape our \nfuture developmental challenges and opportunities.\n\nI begin with an unfortunate, inconvenient truth: \nour collective failure to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) is largely rooted not \nin the shortcomings of earnest and hardworking \ndeveloping countries, but in developed countries\u2019 abject \nabandonment of Goal 8, \u201cDevelop a global partnership \nfor development\u201d. The Organization\u2019s own MDG Gap \nTask Force noted in its report entitled \u201cThe Global \nPartnership for Development: The Challenge We Face\u201d \nthat the quest for such a global partnership experienced \nsignificant backsliding in 2013 and that \u201cthe political \nmomentum for advancing international development \ncooperation seems to have waned\u201d.\n\nSixteen of 25 developed countries decreased \ntheir aid budgets last year, and official development \nassistance (ODA) contracted for the second consecutive \nyear, the first such contraction since the creation of \nthe MDGs. In a time of crisis, when assistance is most \nneeded, ODA is itself in a deep and prolonged recession. \nThe twists and turns by so many developed countries \non this issue have been most disappointing. Without \npredictable flows of meaningful, non-discretionary \nassistance, the post-2015 development programme will \nremain, substantially, a fleeting illusion to be pursued \nbut rarely, if ever, attained.\n\nAt the same time, I applaud the efforts of those \ndeveloped nations that take their ODA commitments \nseriously. I hail, too, a raft of other countries that are \nin a genuine developmental and functional partnership \nwith us. These include Trinidad and Tobago, Cuba, \nVenezuela and Taiwan. Indeed, Taiwan, a country not \nwashed by our Caribbean Sea, has been remarkable in its \nprincipled and practical conduct of intergovernmental \nrelations. Surely the time has now come for this \nexemplar of the magnificent Chinese civilization to be \npermitted to participate fully in the work of the various \nagencies of this world body.\n\nOur debate on the future developmental agenda of \nthe international community is taking place against the \nbackdrop of the ongoing global economic and financial \ncrisis. The global economy remains precariously \npoised, and for every nation that seems to have turned \nthe corner, another plunges back into recession. The \nimpact of the crisis on development has been palpable \nand has rendered the MDGs unattainable in many \ncountries. Therefore, if we are to discuss the post-\n2015 development agenda, we must also discuss the \nreform agenda of our outmoded international financial \narchitecture, whose failings contributed to the current \ncrisis, and whose continued stasis is a reckless invitation \nto future economic turmoil.\n\nDespite the challenges of the ongoing exogenous \nshocks, including natural disasters, and the encumbrances \nimposed by an insufficiently flexible international \nfinancial architecture, my country continues to make \nsignificant strides in our people-centred approach \nto development and poverty alleviation. This past \nJune, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was one of \n18 countries recognized by the Food and Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO) for having \nachieved the part of Millennium Development Goal 1 on \nhalving the proportion of hungry people by 2015 \u2014 and \nwe have reduced it to below 5 per cent \u2014 and the more \nstringent World Food Summit goal of halving the \nabsolute number of hungry people by 2015.\n\nFor a small, vulnerable country to achieve this task \nahead of schedule and in the midst of this debilitating \nglobal economic and financial crisis is truly outstanding. \nWe have done so while maintaining and advancing \ngood governance, individual liberties and democracy \nin accordance with global best practices.\n\nBut the ambitions of my Government are far greater \nthan Goal 1 of the MDGs. Having more than halved \nhunger, we have now set our sights on the elimination of \nhunger altogether: to achieve zero hunger. We hope that \nthe United Nations and the international community \ncan partner with us effectively in fulfilling that historic \nambition. Our policy goal of ensuring that no man, \nwoman or child goes to bed hungry will have its own \npositive knock-on effects on poverty reduction, health \nand arresting the spread of chronic non-communicable \n\n\n\f\ndiseases \u2014 which itself should also be of central \nimportance to our post-2015 development agenda.\n\nAs the Assembly is well aware, the roots of \nunderdevelopment and exploitation extend much \ndeeper than the recent abandonment of MDG Goal 8 \nby the bulk of developed countries. I arrived at this \nyear\u2019s general debate from the Caribbean\u2019s first-ever \nregional conference on reparations for native genocide \nand slavery, which was held in Saint Vincent and \nthe Grenadines. That stirring and uplifting regional \nconference was the first step in the Caribbean\u2019s \nquest to address and redress a psychic, historical, \nsocioeconomic and developmental wound that is, for \nthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM), 14 nations \nwide and 400 years deep.\n\nThe genocidal oppression and suffering of my \ncountry\u2019s indigenous Callinago, the Garifuna and \nenchained Africans have been rightly adjudged to \nhave been a horrendous crime against humanity. \nAccordingly, the collective voice of our Caribbean \ncivilization ought justly to ring out for reparations for \nnative genocide and African slavery from the successor \nStates of the European countries that committed \norganized State-sponsored native genocide and African \nenslavement. \n\nThe awful legacy of those crimes against \nhumanity \u2014 a legacy that exists today in the \nCaribbean \u2014 ought to be repaired for the developmental \nbenefit of our Caribbean societies and all our \npeoples. The historic wrongs of native genocide and \nAfrican slavery and their continuing contemporary \nconsequences must be righted and repaired, in the \ninterests of our people\u2019s humanity. \n\nEuropean nations must partner in a focused, special \nway with us to execute that repairing. The demand for \nreparations is therefore the responsibility not only of \nthe descendants, in today\u2019s Caribbean, of the Callinago, \nthe Garifuna, the Amerindian and the African. It \nis undoubtedly an agenda for all of us to advance, \npromote, concretize and execute. The European nations \nthat engaged in conquest, settlement, genocide and \nslavery in our Caribbean must provide the resources \nrequired to repair the contemporary legacy of those \nhistoric wrongs. That is undoubtedly a special pillar in \nthe post-2015 development agenda.\n\nThat repairing of the mind, of collective memory, of \nour economies and of our societies is part and parcel of \nthe rebirth, the redemption and the further ennoblement \nof our Caribbean, our indigenous populations, our \nAfrican descendants and, indeed, of Africa. I say to the \nAssembly that the struggle for reparations represents, \nimmediately, a defining issue for our Caribbean in the \ntwenty-first century. It promises to make both Europe \nand the Caribbean more free, more human and more \ngood-neighbourly. CARICOM recently decided, quite \nrightly, to place the quest for reparations at the centre \nof its development agenda.\n\nI am also compelled to speak today on a \ncontemporary injustice that is entirely within the \ncapacity of the Assembly to address. In 2010, negligent, \nor even reckless, United Nations peacekeepers \ncontaminated a Haitian drinking water supply, which \nled to an outbreak of cholera that killed 8,000 innocent \nHaitians and infected 600,000 others. There is no \nlonger any scientific dispute that the United Nations is \nresponsible for the outbreak, as has been conclusively \nestablished in the relevant reports. Prior to the United \nNations negligence, Haiti had not seen a single case of \ncholera in 150 years. There are more cholera-infected \npersons in Haiti today than in the rest of the world.\n\nI continue to be deeply disturbed by the callous \ndisregard of the United Nations of the suffering it has \nwrought in a fellow CARICOM country, and by the \nshameful and legalistic avoidance of what is a clear \nmoral responsibility on the part of the United Nations. \nAccordingly, I call on Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \nto acknowledge unambiguously, and apologize for, \nthe Organization\u2019s role in that tragedy and to take \nimmediate steps to compensate the victims and their \nfamilies. Anything less will further undermine the \nmoral authority and credibility of this institution.\n\nSixty-eight years ago, our predecessors conceived \nof a grand experiment, a commitment to bind the \nworld together in a collective quest for peace, justice \nand development. Over time, we have established a \nbody of rules, laws and expectations that add flesh \nto the principles that undergird the Charter of the \nUnited Nations. Now, we are engaged \u2014 explicitly \nand indirectly, willingly and reluctantly \u2014 in a \nreassessment of that grand commitment. Today, the \nactions of a small subset of powerful nations shake the \nvery foundations upon which the Assembly was built \nand threaten to bring the temple down upon the heads \nof those of us who still subscribe to the original tenets \nof our institution.\n\nProperly conceived and universally adhered to, \ninternational law is the bulwark against impunity, \n\n\n\f\nunilateralism, and Great Power triumphalism. Today, \nthere are those in the Assembly who hold a curious view \nof international law, as something that must be imposed \nagainst others but which has limited applicability \nto themselves. To some in the Assembly it seems \nappropriate to disregard international law in the very \nenforcement of their distorted view of international law. \nClearly, such conduct is unacceptable, for the simple \nreason that it threatens the continued legitimacy of our \nentire multilateral system.\n\nSmall, vulnerable States, by definition and \nnecessity, are those most reliant upon an enforceable \nbody of equitable international law within an effective \nsystem of multilateral diplomacy. It is no surprise, \ntherefore, that small States like my own have emerged \nas some of the strongest defenders of multilateralism, \nsovereignty, diplomacy and the rule of law. We view \nit as our responsibility to sound the alarm when this \ninstitution threatens to depart from the founding \nprinciples that bind us together.\n\nAccording to basic reason and historical experience, \nno nation is intrinsically superior to another and no \npeople are innately better than nothers. To be sure, there \nare cultural and social differences, but being different \ndoes not imply a condition of being better or worse. \nOne nation may be more powerful than another, but \nthat circumstance should never permit the powerful to \nascribe arrogantly to themselves, in laughable vanity, \nthe doctrine of exceptionalism. Inevitably, that vain \nascription swiftly degenerates into an embrace of the \ndamning path of the rightness of unilateral force, rather \nthan an uplifting multilateral force of rightness.\n\nFlagrant examples of a continuing disregard for \ninternational law abound. Surely, it diminishes a \ngreat nation such as the United States of America to \ncontinue with what I consider to be a myopic vendetta \nagainst Cuba by way of an illegal, outdated and hurtful \neconomic blockade and the absurd declaration that \nCuba is a sponsor of terrorism. All right-thinking \npersons across the world justly demand that the United \nStates end the economic blockade against Cuba and \nremove its name from the unilaterally drawn up list \nof States that allegedly sponsor terrorism. It makes \nno sense whatsoever for international law to become a \nprisoner of domestic politics and the vain glories of a \nGreat Power. \n\nSimilarly, the plight of the Palestinian people is \nbeing sacrificed on the altar of political expediency, with \na disregard for the opinions of almost all of humankind. \nThe issue certainly entails enormous complexities but, \nunless it is resolved satisfactorily, sustainable peace \nin the Middle East will remain unattainable. Saint \nVincent and the Grenadines hopes that current moves \ntowards serious negotiations will bear fruit in line with \nthe principles and mandates that have been spelled out \nrepeatedly in various United Nations resolutions.\n\nAt the same time, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines \nis very impressed by the efforts of the President of \nthe United States to embrace diplomacy rather than \nmilitary intervention in pursuit of a political settlement \nin Syria. The Syrian community in my country, rightly \nand anxiously, looks forward to peace in its troubled \nhomeland. Only the extremists will benefit from a \nprolonged civil war. Still, peace cannot be sought \nreasonably when a precondition of regime change \nis advanced. All sides in the conflict must make real \ncompromises in the interests of the Syrian people as a \nwhole.\n\nThere is one emerging issue of consequence that \nneeds to be addressed. It concerns the deeply disturbing \nrecent reports of the widespread and unrestrained \nspying that has allegedly been conducted by the United \nStates of America against a number of countries, \nincluding its staunchest allies. Indeed, there are reports \nthat the practice of such electronic espionage is rife, \neven within the halls and offices of the United Nations. \nWe strongly reject such activity as illegal, a violation \nof diplomatic conventions and an affront to the comity \nof nations. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines believes \nthe agenda for appropriate corrective action in that \nregard, as outlined earlier this week by the President \nof Brazil, to be fair, reasonable and achievable by the \ninternational community.\n\nAs we continue our collective journey in the quest \nfor greater and lasting global peace, we are reminded \nthat wars do not erupt only between countries, but also \nwithin them. We also know that some of the highest \nnumbers of violent deaths occur in countries that are \napparently at peace. \n\nThis year, the international community has \nrecognized that genuine and lasting peace between and \nwithin nations, cities and villages cannot occur in an \nenvironment that allows an unregulated trade in small \narms and light weapons. The Arms Trade Treaty, which \nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines signed on the very \nfirst day that it opened for signature, is far weaker than \nwe would have liked. Nonetheless, we consider it to be \nan important first step in regulating the illicit flow of \n\n\n\f\nsmall arms and light weapons worldwide, particularly \ninto the Caribbean region, where the tide of guns is \noften accompanied by torrents of narcotics as they \nmake their way to markets in other countries.\n\nI am deeply disappointed at the international \ncommunity\u2019s endless, rudderless and seemingly \nvacuous negotiations on climate change. Our failure \nto achieve meaningful progress on this matter of \nexistential urgency is inexcusable. Vulnerable countries \nlike Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are on the front \nline of climate change and are already bearing the brunt \nof the increasing fallout of global warming. Meanwhile, \nthe major emitters and historical polluters pay callously \ninsincere lip service to our plight. For them, combating \nclimate change is a question of dollars and cents, not \nlife and death. They are only too happy to see the \nmultilateral process fail, so that they can retreat into \nineffectual and painless national commitments. But \nthose stubborn obstacles to progress must no longer \nbe allowed to stand in the way of the survival and \ndevelopment of vast swaths of our planet.\n\nI applaud the initiative of the Secretary-General \nto convene a high-level event on climate change in the \nhope that such a meeting will give our meandering \nnegotiations impetus and direction. The post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda will not survive global warming \nif it goes unchecked. It is also high time for genuine \nnegotiations in good faith and for meaningful resources \nto assist in mitigating and adapting to the effects of \nclimate change.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to recall that the Charter \nof the United Nations begins with the phrase \u201cWe the \npeoples of the United Nations.\u201d It is not \u201cWe the rich \npeoples\u201d, nor \u201cWe the militarily powerful peoples\u201d \nnor \u201cWe the peoples of large countries\u201d; but \u201cWe the \npeoples\u201d \u2014 of the entire world, the whole membership \nof this institution. The United Nations does not exist \nto confer benefits to select groups, but to secure peace \nand development for all. If we are to set the stage for \nthe future of development, that stage must be inclusive \nso that all nations and peoples have a significant part to \nplay and a stake in the outcomes. Let us make ourselves \nworthy successors of the ennobling, humanizing vision \nof our venerated founding fathers and mothers. \n\nI shall be saying this ages and ages hence: two \nroads diverge in the woods, and I have chosen the one \nless travelled by, and that has made all the difference. \n"

        "file_text": "Let me begin by extending my \nwarmest congratulations to Mr. John William Ashe on \nhis election as President of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-eighth session. His election to that esteemed \noffice is a fitting tribute to the personal and diplomatic \nqualities that he has exhibited over the years.\n\nThroughout the world, peace and development have \nremained dominant themes of our times. People all over \nthe world have been raising their voices in favour of \npeace, development and cooperation, and against war, \npoverty and confrontation. Here at the United Nations \nwe all acknowledge that peace, security, development \nand human rights are the pillars of the United Nations \nsystem and the cornerstones of our collective well-\nbeing.\n\nIn that regard, the theme for this session, \u201cThe \npost-2015 development agenda: setting the stage\u201d, is \nquite pertinent and timely, as it gives fresh impetus to \nour understanding that achieving the internationally \nagreed development goals, including the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), and mapping the way \nforward beyond 2015 requires our collective efforts. \nThe United Nations, as the centre for international \ncooperation, should lead in promoting the envisaged \ndevelopment.\n\nThirteen years ago, our global efforts were \nmobilized behind the Millennium Development Goals. \nWe now have less than 1,000 days in which to meet \nthose targets. Our review and stocktaking exercise \nreveals that, while there have been some significant \nachievements, there are still gaps and unevenness in the \nattainment of the Goals. \n\nIn the case of Zimbabwe, we have made progress \ntowards achieving universal access to primary education \nand combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. \nHowever, some of the Goals are off track owing to \nlack of capacity \u2014 mainly financial capacity \u2014 and \nin some areas progress has stalled, including in those \nareas relating to the eradication of poverty and hunger, \nchild mortality, universal access to maternal and \nreproductive health, environmental sustainability and \naccess to potable water and sanitation. As a country, \nwe are committed to undertaking coordinated efforts to \naccelerate progress to complete the unfinished business \nof the MDGs in the remaining period leading up to 2015. \nAny goals that have not been achieved by then should \nbe integrated into the post-2015 development agenda.\n\nZimbabwe fully shares and supports the emerging \nconsensus that eradicating poverty in all its dimensions \nshould be the overarching goal of our post-2015 \nagenda. Eradicating poverty by 2030 may be an \nambitious goal, but it is attainable if we mobilize our \ncollective efforts. Building on the foundation of the \nMDGs, the post-2015 agenda should go beyond the \nsocial development agenda of the MDGs and achieve \nstructural transformation in our economies that delivers \ninclusive and sustainable growth. We expect a shift \nthat will bring about industrialization, decent jobs and \nqualitative change to the lives of our citizens. We are \ndetermined to modernize our infrastructure and ensure \naccess to sustainable energy for all, food security and \nnutrition. However, we recognize that we cannot do that \nin isolation from other partners.\n\nIn the same vein, we also support calls to prioritize \ngender equality, the health-related MDGs, education \nand environmental sustainability in the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda, among other issues. Those are \ncritical matters in our quest to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment for all our people.\n\nThe lofty objectives of the Charter of the United \nNations in the economic arena will remain unfulfilled \n\n\n\f\nunless all Member States join in efforts, genuinely \nand seriously, to address challenges that developing \ncountries face in their pursuit of development, \nincluding meeting the MDGs. It is therefore imperative \nthat our discussions address what has so far been the \nweakest link, namely, the means of implementation. It \nmust be understood that, in addition to national efforts, \nsubstantial international support and an enabling \ninternational economic environment are essential if the \nMDGs are to be achieved by 2015, especially in Africa. \nIt is therefore important to fulfil the commitments \nmade to support Africa in various international forums. \nThe United Nations should track the fulfilment of those \ncommitments.\n\nZimbabwe supports the reform of the United \nNations to strengthen its central role in promoting \nmultilateralism and to be effective in tackling current \nand future global challenges. We are convinced that \nreform would strengthen the Organization\u2019s capacity \nto fully promote and implement the purposes and \nprinciples of the Charter and improve its democratic \ndecision-making.\n\nIn that regard, the reforms in the economic \nand social actions of the United Nations remain of \nfundamental importance to us. Our firm belief in \nmultilateral cooperation means that we place a premium \nin the ability of the United Nations system to deliver \nefficient development cooperation. The democratic \ntransformation of the architecture of the international \nfinancial system is essential, as is a root-and-branch \nreform of the international trading system. The terms \nof trade have hugely burdened developing countries for \ntoo long.\n\nZimbabwe supports the ongoing efforts to \nrevitalize the General Assembly, which is the most \nrepresentative organ of the United Nations. We believe \nthat the Assembly should take the lead in setting the \nglobal agenda and restore its primacy, which has over \nthe years been encroached upon by other organs. We \ncannot accept situations whereby the Security Council is \nincreasingly encroaching upon issues that traditionally \nfall within the General Assembly\u2019s purview and \ncompetence, including in the area of norm-setting. \nRecent events have revealed that the formal decisions of \nthe Security Council have provided camouflage to neo-\nimperialist forces of aggression seeking to militarily \nintervene in smaller countries in order to effect regime \nchange and acquire complete control of their wealth. \nThat was the case in Libya, where, in the name of \nprotecting civilians, NATO forces were deployed with \nan undeclared mission to eliminate Al-Qadhafi and his \nfamily. A similar campaign was undertaken in Iraq by \nthe Bush and Blair forces under the guise of eradicating \nweapons of mass destruction, which Saddam Hussein \nnever possessed.\n\nWe appreciate the central role that the United \nNations should play in furthering multilateralism in \npreference to unilateralism. In that regard, we applaud \nthe consultations and negotiations on the eventual \ndestruction of the chemical weapons in Syria. My \ncountry expresses its gratitude and appreciation to \nRussia and China for their principled stand on Syria. \nWe hope and trust that the Syrian people will soon sit \nin dialogue to discuss peace and desirable political \nreforms. Those Western countries in pursuit of \nhegemony as they pretend to be advocates of democracy \nmust be resisted.\n\nFor Africa, the reform of the Security Council \nis especially long overdue. The anachronistic and \nunrepresentative character of the Council must be \nredressed. For how long should Africa continue to be \ndenied the right to play a pivotal role in the Security \nCouncil as it decides measures on conflicts within \nthe borders of that very continent? The Security \nCouncil needs to be more representative, democratic, \ntransparent, accountable and accessible to the wider \nmembership for its decisions to have greater legitimacy. \nAfrica\u2019s case for the correction of the glaring historical \ninjustice of being unrepresented in the permanent \ncategory and underrepresented in the non-permanent \ncategory has been made through the clear, fair and well \narticulated Ezulwini Consensus. Zimbabwe remains \nsteadfast in its support of the Ezulwini Consensus, \nwhich is, in fact, a demand.\n\nZimbabwe strongly condemns the use of unilateral \neconomic sanctions as a foreign policy tool to effect \nregime change. The illegal economic sanctions imposed \non Zimbabwe by the United States and the European \nUnion violate fundamental principles of the Charter \nof the United Nations on State sovereignty and the \nnon-interference in the domestic affairs of a sovereign \nState. Moreover, those illegal sanctions continue to \ninflict economic deprivation and human suffering on all \nZimbabweans. In the eyes of our people, the sanctions \nconstitute a form of hostility and violence against them \nfor the simple crime of undertaking the land reform \nprogramme by which land was put in the hands of the \nthen majority landless Zimbabweans. Our small and \n\n\n\f\npeaceful country is threatened daily by covetous and \nbigoted big Powers whose hunger for domination and \ncontrol over other nations and their resources knows \nno bounds.\n\nShame, shame, shame, we say to the United \nStates of America. Shame, shame, shame, we say to \nBritain and its allies, who have continued to impose \nillegal sanctions on our people. Zimbabwe is for \nZimbabweans; so are its ample resources. I ask those \ncountries to please remove their illegal and iniquitous \nsanctions from my peaceful nation. If those sanctions \nwere intended to effect regime change, well, the results \nof the recent national elections have clearly shown them \nthat they cannot achieve their agenda.\n\nWe are preached to daily by the West on the \nvirtues of democracy and freedom, which they do not \nentirely espouse. Zimbabwe took up arms precisely \nto achieve freedom and democracy. There was none \nduring colonialism, and it was British colonialism, for \nthat matter. Yet we have been punished by the United \nStates through the odious Zimbabwe Democracy and \nEconomic Recovery Act, which it enacted in 2001 to \neffect regime change in our country. Now that malicious \nintent to continue with the relentless persecution of our \nsmall, peaceful country has shown itself again, through \nthe rejection by the United States of the recent and \nabsolutely democratic and fair results of our general \nelections of 31 July, even as they were applauded by the \nAfrican Union and all our regional organizations. \n\nIt appears that when the United States and its allies \nspeak of democracy and freedom they do so in relative \nterms. Zimbabwe, however, refuses to accept that those \nWestern detractors have the right to define democracy \nand freedom for it. We made the greatest sacrifice and \npaid the ultimate price for freedom and independence \nin Zimbabwe, and we remain determined never to \nrelinquish our sovereignty, as at the same time we \nremain masters of our destiny. As we have repeatedly \nand loudly said and asserted, Zimbabwe will never be \na colony again.\n"

        "file_text": "At the \noutset, let me convey to the United States authorities \nour full gratitude for the always warm and fraternal \nhospitality they show us at this great annual event in \nNew York at the United Nations. I also express my \nsincere congratulations to the President, and I wish him \nevery success and an excellent conduct of the work of \nthe Assembly at its sixty-eighth session on the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda. Finally, on behalf of my delegation \nand myself, I join the other heads of delegations present \nin the Hall to express my full gratitude to Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-Moon for his willingness to serve our \nworld with the commitment and self-sacrifice for which \nhe is known. \n\nAt a time when the world is facing the most serious \nkinds of crises, blind barbaric terrorist acts, which \nwe strongly condemn, have just been perpetrated in \nKenya, claiming dozens of innocent victims, including \nwomen and children. At a time when armed conflicts \nare challenging our common abilities to build a world \nwhere peace reigns, the crisis that has been evolving \nin Syria for two and a half years, with its litany of \ndistress and human tragedy, should call on us to reach \nan early settlement of the conflict and put an end to the \nsuffering of the Syrian people. We strongly condemn \nthe use of chemical weapons in Syria against innocent \npopulations, just as we vigorously condemn the \nperpetrators of that horrible act. \n\nLet me formally draw our attention to other crises \nand other evils that, while they may appear to us to be \nminor or insignificant, are also every bit as serious. \nThey are serious particularly because they lead to a \nheavy loss of human lives and, for those who live with \nthem daily, they frequently give rise to frustration, \nscorn and a sense of abandonment. \n\nAt the same time, those other evils actually should \nnot even exist, because it was together in the United \nNations that our predecessors unanimously, in a spirit \nof the equality of peoples, universal justice, fairness and \nhumanism, decided with an open heart and free spirit to \nmake humankind more harmonious for the well-being \nof our species. Indeed, it was our Organization that \ndecided to decolonize all territories under the colonial \nyoke. It set the rules, laid out a path, and supported the \npeoples to be freed. \n\nLet me also pay tribute to the permanent members \nof the Security Council and to all States Members of \nthe United Nations for the responsible attitude they \n\n\n\f\nhave demonstrated since the creation of the United \nNations to the present time in supporting national \nliberation movements and organizations, particularly in \nour continent of Africa. It is, however, regrettable that, \n68 years after its inception and after the adoption of the \nCharter, the Assembly continues to bear witness today \nto a situation in which the territory of a small island \nState \u2014 in this case my own country, the Comoro \nArchipelago \u2014 remains under the thumb of another \nState, a major Power and a permanent member of the \nSecurity Council \u2014 the State of France. \n\nAnd yet the Organization came out unequivocally \nin favour of the independence of the Comoro \nArchipelago, in accordance with resolutions 1514 (XV) \nof 14 December 1960 on the Declaration on the Granting \nof Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, and \n2621 (XXV) of 12 October 1970, containing the Plan of \nAction for the Full Implementation of the Declaration \non the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries \nand Peoples. Furthermore, resolutions 3161 (XXVIII) \nof 14 December 1973 and 3291 (XXIX) of 13 December \n1974 reaffirm the unity and territorial and integrity of \nthe Comorian islands and the inalienable right of its \npeople to self-determination and independence.\n\nThus, the Security Council, through its unanimous \nadoption of resolution 376 (1975) of 17 October 1975, \nrecommended to the General Assembly that the \nComoros be admitted to membership in the United \nNations. The Comoros therefore became a Member of \nthe United Nations, under resolution 3385 (XXX) of \n12 November 1975, which reaffirms the need to respect \nthe unity and integrity of the Comoro Archipelago, \ncomposed of the islands of Anjouan, Grande Comore, \nMayotte and Moh\u00e9li. I recall that all Member countries, \nincluding the European countries, voted in favour of \nthat resolution. France did not oppose it.\n\nCan those who lead our States and Governments, \nguarantors of the independence and integrity of their \nterritory, imagine the frustration and moral torture \nof a Head of State who has to deal with such a tragic \nsituation on a daily basis? In addressing them, I am \nletting my heart speak. They may rest assured that \nall my fellow citizens do the same daily. What have \nwe, the Comorian people, done that is so serious that \nhistory does not treat us as it does all other peoples of \nthe world? Why must we time and time again explain \nor justify the united nature of our people, its history, its \ngeography or its culture? Moreover, when some seek to \npersuade us that it is because a part of our population \nsupposedly expressed a desire to remain colonized, we \nsincerely wonder if they are trying to relive the Berlin \nConference of 1885. \n\nIf that were indeed the case, are we to understand \nthat these same people would seek to raise that issue \nwith all peoples who wish to remain themselves or \nchange their destiny? Since it is the desire of all people \nto strive for freedom, what would happen if one day \nthe Comorian people of Mayotte called for its freedom \nfrom France? What a historical inconsistency that \nwould be, and what norms of international law would \nthe Organization act on?\n\nSince 6 July 1975, the date on which my country, \nthe Comoros Archipelago, acceded to its sovereignty, \nthe Comorians have continued to call simply for the \nimplementation of international law. They have done so \nin vain. And yet, in other similar cases, certain major \nPowers demand compliance with the same international \nlaw and win their case. Thus, the movement of peoples \namong the islands of the Comoros Archipelago, which \nis an inalienable right, is impeded by an unfathomable \nand unacceptable decision of the French authorities who, \nin 1994, imposed a visa on travel between Mayotte and \nthe three other Comorian islands. That visa system has \nto date led to the death of nearly 10,000 of my fellow \ncitizens, making the strait that separates Mayotte and \nthe other islands the largest marine cemetery in the \nworld. Our common conscience requires that we act \nquickly.\n\nIn all international forums, including the \nUnited Nations, the international community, while \nrecognizing the right of the Comorians to recover \ntheir territorial integrity, has repeatedly called upon \nthe two parties involved, the Comoros and France, to \nenter into negotiations in order to find a lasting and \nequitable solution to this unfortunate territorial dispute \nin accordance with international law. Each of my \npredecessors in turn undertook negotiations with the \nFrench State, but it is undeniable that we are still at \nsquare one.\n\nSince I was elected President of the Republic, I \nhave thought a great deal about the issue and consulted \nwidely. The responsibilities I have assumed require \nchanging a game that has remained unchanged now \nfor 38 years. After an initial meeting with my French \ncounterpart, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, in Kinshasa, \non the sidelines of the Summit of La Francophonie, I \nunderstood that the new French authorities were at long \nlast ready to find a solution to the issue of the Comoros. \n\n\n\f\nI noted and acknowledge that France today is prepared \nto play its historic role as a State that is respectful of \ninternational law, regardless of what that law may say \non any particular subject. What France has recently \ndone for Mali is the most eloquent example of that. \n\nOn that note, let me join the Malian authorities and \npeople and the African continent in general to thank the \nFrench authorities who took the responsible decision to \nensure that the armed forces of the Republic of Chad \nand the countries in the West African region join the \nFrench armed forces in helping Mali recover its unity \nand territorial integrity. I take this opportunity also to \nwelcome the presence among us here of His Excellency \nMr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, President of the Republic \nof Mali, and express our joy in sharing with the brother \npeople of Mali the sense of pride at their having \nrecovered the integrity of their territory.\n\nMove by the same ideal and the same hope of seeing \nmy country recover its territorial integrity, I warmly \nwelcomed the invitation from President Fran\u00e7ois \nHollande to carry out a working visit to France in \norder to undertake serious negotiations and give a new \nimpetus to our relations, particularly on the issue of the \nComorian island of Mayotte. In the wake of that visit, \nwe signed and issued a political declaration, the so-\ncalled Paris Declaration. Before my visit, I consulted \nthe Chairperson of the African Union Commission in \norder to ensure that our latest effort was in keeping with \nthe principles upheld by our continental organization \nand also to consult her expertise. I take this opportunity \nto express all our gratitude to Ms. Dlamini-Zuma, \nChairperson of the African Union Commission, for her \nongoing support to our country. \n\nIn thus expressing myself, I call on the entire \ninternational community to bear witness to my request \nthat the Secretary-General provide his expertise, \nsupport and backing throughout the negotiations for \nthe new dynamic to which we and the French have \nresolutely committed. \n\nI would like to inform the General Assembly that \nthe issue of Mayotte will henceforth be on our agenda \nevery year and that we, the Comorian authorities, are \ncommited to reporting every year on the course of the \nnegotiations until a lasting settlement is found to the \nissue of the sovereignty of my country. My country \ncalls on the United Nations and other international \norganizations with which we are affiliated \u2014 including \nthe African Union, the International Organization \nof La Francophonie, the League of Arab States, the \nOrganization of Islamic Cooperation, the Non-Aligned \nMovement and the Indian Ocean Commission \u2014 to \nprovide us with their full support during the negotiations.\n\nA high joint council, the follow-up body to the \nParis Declaration that I mentioned previously, will be \nestablished in the weeks ahead. It will begin its work \nthis year by considering the problem of the movement \nof goods and persons in order to put an irreversible end \nto the human tragedies that daily afflict all Comorian \nfamilies.\n\nNever has our world has been so close to achieving \nthe objective for which we, the world\u2019s leaders, meet in \nthis United Nations temple at least once a year. That goal, \nas the United Nations Charter stipulates, is to maintain \ninternational peace and security. It would therefore be \nappropriate for me, before I conclude my statement, to \ncommend the efforts of the international community \nthat have led to considerable progress in Madagascar, \nthereby opening the path to the forthcoming presidential \nelections in that great brother country. \n\nIn order to ensure that \u201cThe post-2015 development \nagenda: setting the stage\u201d, which is the theme of the \nsixty-eighth session, is not just one more pipe dream, \nwe need to act quickly to shelter our peoples from fear \nand need. Let us dare to fight injustice. Let us dare to \nput an end to deadly conflict. Let us dare to make peace \nour daily struggle and our sole reason for being, so that \nhumankind may live in harmony.\n"

        "file_text": "\nIt is a great honour for my country to congratulate \nMr. Ashe upon his election as President of the General \nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. He can count on \nthe unconditional support of the delegation of Panama \nduring his tenure. We cannot think of a more appropriate \ntheme for this high-level debate than to focus on \u201cThe \npost-2015 development agenda: setting the stage\u201d. \nThe theme invites us to reaffirm our commitment to \ncontinuing to work towards an agreement on the new \ndevelopment agenda. The agenda will be available for \nour people and the planet. \n\nThe 13 years that have elapsed since we identified \na way to achieve development through the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) have witnessed the fastest \nreduction in poverty in the history of mankind. In \nthat connection, we as Panamanians have had great \npleasure in carrying out studies indicating that half a \nbillion fewer people now live below the poverty line, \n\n\n\f\nthat infant mortality rates have fallen by over 30 per \ncent, and that deaths owing to malaria have declined by \na quarter, among other things. \n\nPanama has presented three national reports on the \nMDGs. They have demonstrated our country\u2019s progress \nin improving the living conditions of our population and \nin setting the issue of poverty as a priority on the social \nagenda and focusing the Government\u2019s contribution \non achieving clear, concrete and measurable goals to \nreduce poverty and the inequality gap. We have made \nnotable progress in various areas. That is where we need \nto redouble our efforts so as to provide Panamanian \ncitizens with a better future and so that all may benefit \nfrom a better Panama.\n\nIn 2012, along with 17 other countries, Panama \nreceived the Americas Award for reducing poverty and \nhunger. On behalf of the people of Panama, we recently \naccepted an award from the United Nations Food and \nAgricultural Organization for reaching the goal of \neradicating extreme poverty and hunger, between \n1990 and 2015, by halving the number of people who \nsuffer from hunger and by reducing the prevalence of \nundernourishment by 50 per cent or more, with respect \nto the levels in 1990-1992, now below five per cent. We \nare pleased with the work we have done.\n\nFor the first time in history, humankind has the \ntechnological, economic and sociopolitical structures \nto eradicate extreme poverty. With an agenda for \ndevelopment coordinated between the public and \nprivate sectors and civil society, we can carry out \na meaningful process that makes a difference and \nreaches everybody. Because of its capacity and scope, \nthe United Nations has played a facilitating role, unlike \nthat of any other organization, in order to coordinate \nthe global conversation about development, and it has \na special responsibility to its Member States to provide \ninformation, analytical thinking and experience from \nthe field.\n\nIn that regard, I wish to thank the Secretary-\nGeneral for establishing a United Nations task force \nand in particular for convening the High-level Panel \nof Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development \nAgenda, whose extraordinary efforts are now giving us \nmore insights into a more productive discussion about \nwhat path we should follow. The post-2015 agenda \nshould focus on eradicating extreme poverty from the \nface of the Earth within a set time frame. Countries have \nlearned much about development. We have realized \nthat development that is not sustainable is simply not \ndevelopment.\n\nThe MDGs were silent on conflict and the effect \nof violence on global development, nor was the impact \nand importance of institutions that guarantee freedom \nof expression and the rule of law for development \nincluded. The Government of the Republic of Panama \nbelieves that we need to integrate the economic, social \nand environmental aspects of development more \nsustainably. For that we support the efforts resulting \nfrom decisions made at the United Nations Conference \non Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro and the \nwork resulting from the meetings convened for the \nestablishment of the High-level Political Forum.\n\nGlobal inequality is still prevalent and very much \na part of this conversation. Some 1.2 billion people \naccount for only 1 per cent of global consumption. The \nRepublic of Panama has successfully reformed its trade, \ntax policies and transparency. In the same manner, we \nhave reviewed the regulation of our financial markets \nand productivity. As a result, we have, as far as possible, \ncharted a successful path towards development. It is \nclear that now we face even greater challenges, different \nfrom the previous ones.\n\nFinancing development is not easy, but we have \na great capacity and the patterns of productivity are \nbecoming more sustainable and equitable. Panama \nsupports the view that the post-2015 agenda must make \nsustainable development a cornerstone and not leave \nanyone behind.\n\nThe original promise of the MDGs must be \nkept. The new route towards development must be \ntransformed from reducing poverty to ending extreme \npoverty. Furthermore, the fight against inequality must \nbe a substantial part of our development agenda and \nshould be measured by the social inclusion generated \nfrom economic growth. The promotion and protection \nof universal human rights must be an integral part of a \npost-2015 development agenda.\n\nSimilarly, institutions and the rule of law must be \nevaluated as contributions toward the development of \ncountries. Equally, a sustainable planet is crucial not \njust for the growth of our peoples, but also for their \nsurvival. Finding a solution for global environmental \nproblems should be a priority of the development \nagenda. That is why we support the integration of \nsustainable development objectives into the post-2015 \nagenda.\n\n\n\f\nPanamanians believe that unless we forge a \nglobal partnership, nothing we say in this Hall will be \neffective. We need a new spirit of mutual accountability \nthat supports the post-2015 agenda and the work done \nby the United Nations towards that end. There is no \ndoubt that the post-2015 agenda will depend on new \neconomic partnerships and financing.\n\nThe post-2015 agenda cannot possibly succeed \nwithout the active support of the Group of 20 and the \ninstitutions of economic cooperation and governance, \nsuch as the International Monetary Fund and the World \nTrade Organization. The General Assembly has been \ngiven an historic opportunity to promote a platform for \nglobal development, with so many leaders present here, \ntogether, with only one theme in mind. We believe that \neffective political leadership emanating from the high-\nlevel event on the Millennium Development Goals and \nits forum can give us decisive momentum to make a \nlegitimate change to our post-2015 agenda.\n\nAs we ponder the post-2015 development agenda, we \ncannot set aside the purpose for which this Organization \nwas created, namely, to ensure the maintenance of \nworld peace, through undivided and full respect for the \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms of all people \non Earth, without any discrimination. \n\nIn that regard, we cannot let this moment pass without \nexpressing the deep concern that Panama shares with \nmany members of the Assembly on the grave situation \nin Syria. We condemn, in the strongest terms, the use \nof chemical weapons against the civilian population \nof Syria. We share the view that such acts constitute \na crime against humanity that should be investigated \nand punished in accordance with the norms of existing \ninternational law. We firmly call upon all members of \nthe Security Council to assume their responsibilities to \nensure compliance with international humanitarian law \nand international protection of the human rights of the \nSyrian people.\n\nWe are concerned about the escalating violence in \nthe Middle East and the veiled and open threats of the \nuse of nuclear weapons, which infringe on the right of \ncountries and peoples to live in peace in their territories. \nOur global Organization has the supreme duty to speak \nforcefully and clearly in support of world peace and the \nright of humankind to continue living on our planet. \nIn this crucial time for life and survival on Earth, we \nmust not fall into the habit of believing that nothing \nserious is happening and that life will still go on after \nthe atomic mushroom cloud delivers its final verdict of \ndeath to every species on the planet. The number of \ninterested parties in the Middle East with nuclear power \nand the capacity to introduce and test weapons of mass \ndestruction in a conflict situation is sufficiently large \nthat those of us gathered here cannot afford to ignore \nwhat is happening there. This is no time to hide our \nheads in the sand like ostriches, thinking that we can \nthereby stave off the danger that threatens us and save \nour lives. It is rather the moment to firmly demonstrate \nour collective responsibility to defend world peace and \nlife itself.\n\nI wish to inform the General Assembly that \nmy Government is aware of a request made by the \nGovernment of the Republic of Nicaragua to the \nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, \nestablished under the United Nations Convention on the \nLaw of the Sea, to extend its continental shelf beyond \n200 nautical miles. Without objecting to the right of \nthe Republic of Nicaragua to make such a request, as \nstated in paragraph 8 of article 76 of the Convention, \nmy Government wishes to express its strong concern \nabout the fact that the coordinates given in Nicaragua\u2019s \napplication constitute an unquestionable infringement \non our maritime space and on treaties between the \nRepublic of Panama and its neighbours, resulting in \na reduction of our maritime area of 49,892.54 square \nkilometres. \n\nThe serious concern on the part of the people \nand the Government of Panama is not motivated by \nNicaragua\u2019s request to extend its continental shelf but \nrather because, despite the fact that our two countries \nare connected through friendship, geographic and \nregional proximity and political and economic \nintegration, we were not consulted before the request \nwas made, so that we could consider all of its possible \neffects. The Republic of Panama, in accordance with \nits national Constitution, complies with the standards \nof international law and has always recognized the \njurisdiction of the International Court of Justice as one \nway of achieving the pacific settlement of disputes, \nas laid out in Chapter VI of the Charter of the United \nNations.\n\nIn that regard, we should also emphasize that \naccording to article 59 of the Statute of the International \nCourt of Justice, the decisions handed down by the \nworld\u2019s highest universal tribunal should neither benefit \nnor harm third parties. My Government is therefore \ncompelled to categorically reject the Republic of \nNicaragua\u2019s attempt to delimit its maritime boundaries \n\n\n\f\nin this manner, since it violates existing treaties with \nthe Republic of Panama that we have complied with in \ngood faith, as well as our legitimate maritime rights, \nrecognized and accepted by the international community \nin that area. In accordance with international law, I \nwill produce all the necessary evidence to correct the \nRepublic of Nicaragua\u2019s efforts in this matter. But on \nthe occasion of the current session, officials from both \nour countries have begun the process of resolving our \ndisagreement, which I hope will soon reach a happy \nconclusion.\n\nToday I also wish to mention a third issue that is \nvery important to Panama, the case of the merchant \nvessel MV Chong Chon Gang, sailing under the North \nKorean flag, detained in Panama since mid-July. My \ncountry, as a State Member of this international forum, \ncomplies with the norms and regulations of its internal \nbodies, and article 4 of our Constitution requires \nPanama to comply with the norms of international law. \nThat mandate has governed all of our acts as a nation. \nThe vessel in question was transporting undeclared \nwar materiel from the Republic of Cuba destined for \nNorth Korea. Acting on intelligence that we obtained, \nwe detained the vessel before its transit through the \nCanal on the suspicion that the cargo contained drugs. \nWhen the ship was seized, an enormous amount of war \nmateriel \u2014 which, by definition and because of its \ndestination, clearly violated Security Council Sanctions \nCommittee mandates \u2014 was discovered hidden under \n200 tons of raw sugar.\n\nIn compliance with the mandates in question, my \nGovernment notified a panel of experts and invited \nthem to Panama to verify the findings and confirm our \ninitial impression, as presented by the drugs prosecutor \nwho initiated the investigation under the Republic of \nPanama\u2019s laws. The panel inspected the cargo and \nlater made a preliminary report in accordance with \nSecurity Council resolutions. The evidence is now with \nthe Security Council. My Government would like to \nemphasize the significance of the action it took, not just \nas a Member State but also in its promotion of respect \nfor the decisions of this body and of the peaceful \ncoexistence of nations. We are talking here about an \nunprecedented and possibly unique situation, at least \non our continent, which is why I stress its importance \ntoday. Panama complied with its duty as a Member State, \neven in the face of possible risks, high material costs \nand potential consequences to be defined in accordance \nwith Panamanian law, as outlined in Security Council \nresolutions 1718 (2006), 1874 (2009) and 2094 (2013).\n\nAs President of a sovereign nation, I have not \ncome before this forum to demand action against the \ncountries involved in the incident. Panama simply \ndesires and requests recognition that our conduct was \nbased on our firm wish to comply with the rules that the \nOrganization has laid down. We will respect the results \nof the investigation, and we wish to make it clear that \nPanama has no issue with the States involved in the \nmatter, which is why its settlement is not a bilateral one. \nWe Panamanians did our duty, and the United Nations \nmust now also do its duty, at a time when following \nthe rule of law is the only way to solve the delicate \ninternational problems that threaten the peaceful and \nhuman coexistence of the peoples of the world. \n\nPanama and its people anxiously await just \nrecognition of their act, which we see as an important \nprecedent for our hemisphere. We call on the \ninternational community to implement programmes \nand solutions conducive to peace. Panama reaffirms \nits historical position that we should use the tools of \nmediation and dialogue to deal with all current conflicts \nin the region and to seek solutions that defend and \nprotect the right of peoples to live and work in peace.\n\nSince the end of my term is approaching and this \nis the last address I will give to the General Assembly, \nI wish to say that I feel the satisfaction of a task \ncompleted as I leave Panama in the place it now occupies \nin the world. We leave behind a legacy of social and \npolitical stability and sustained high economic growth \nthroughout the Latin American region, and we have \nhelped to promote and build the common welfare of the \nPanamanian nation. \n\nI would like to cite some favourable statistics that \nillustrate our growth and social welfare, published by \nentirely credible international entities. On the index \nof human development for 2012, according to the \nUnited Nations, Panama is classified as a country of \nhigh human development, scoring 0.780 as compared \nto the average for Latin America, which is 0.741, and \nfor the world as a whole, which is 0.694. In a country \nof 3.63 million inhabitants, 1.83 million are men and \n1.79 million are women, according to the United Nations \nHuman Development Report 2013. On the literacy \nindex, Panama is at 94.1 per cent, also according to \nthe Human Development Report 2013. Panama invests \n4.6 per cent of its gross national product in public \nexpenditures for culture and health, the highest level \nin Central America, according to the Genral Treasury \nof the Republic. Average life expectancy in my country \n\n\n\f\nis 76.3 years, according to the Human Development \nReport 2013.\n\nWhen it comes to the enjoyment of political rights, \nwe have a rating of 1 according to Freedom House in \n2012. Panama\u2019s competitive ranking on the 2013 index \nof the World Economic Forum was forty-eighth out of \n148 countries reviewed, and its Fitch investment rating \nwas upgraded from BB+ to BBB, indicating a stable \nperspective. Our Moody\u2019s rating was Baa2, a stable \nperspective, and according to Standard and Poors \nwe rose from BB+ to BBB, again indicating a stable \nperspective. \n\nThe latest United Nations Conference on Trade \nand Development report shows Panama as one of the \nhighest ranked Latin American countries for maritime \nconnectivity. According to the 2013 index, Panama \nimproved its score from 42.38 to 44.88, similar to \nMexico, which moved from 38.81 to 41.80, while \nBrazil dropped from 38.53 to 36.88. The United \nNations Economic Commission for Latin America \nand the Caribbean estimates that Paraguay leads Latin \nAmerican growth with an increase of 12.5 per cent \nin gross domestic product, followed by Panama, with \n7.5 per cent.The International Monetary Fund estimates \nregional gross domestic product growth in the region as \nfollows for 2013: Paraguay at 11 per cent and Panama \nat 9 per cent. In sum, Panama is on a firm path to full \ndevelopment, and with the support of the international \ncommunity we will continue responsibly to meet the \nchallenges that still face us in order to achieve the \nsustainable development for the well-being of all our \ncitizens.\n\nThe year 2013 has been one of great international \nevents for our country. We will soon have the honour for \nthe second time of hosting a Summit of the Americas, \nthe thirteenth, when Heads of State and Government \nwill discuss the Ibero-American community within \nthe new global context as it pertains to the political, \neconomic, social and cultural spheres. In November, \nwe will also host the forthcoming Conference of States \nParties to the United Nations Convention against \nCorruption, which reflects the priority that our country \naccords to the struggle against corruption as a factor \nin development. In a similar vein, we will continue to \nadvance projects for the establishment in our country \nof a regional hub for humanitarian assistance and \nof a regional centre of the United Nations for Latin \nAmerica and the Caribbean. That project will serve as \nour contribution to the international community, with \nrespect both to humanitarian actors and to the United \nNations system, and expresses our full support for their \nefforts on behalf of those most in need.\n\nI am an optimistic man. I believe in human \nintelligence and in the capacity of our species to \nrecognize errors and dangers in order to change course \nand ensure our continuity on this planet. Moreover, \nthe nation of men and women of which I am the leader \nshares the dreams of a world united by its respect \nfor life and by the way it values and loves the vast \ncultural heritage that has been built by generation upon \ngeneration of people. I am convinced that however \ngreat the challenges and dangers that lie in wait for \nus may be, we will know how to meet and overcome \nthem with courage and intelligence. Nevertheless, I feel \ncompelled to mention the great dangers that surround \nus today. Only through concerted, responsible action \nwill we be able to overcome the difficult hour that faces \nhumankind.\n\nToday, multilateralism itself is being sorely tested. \nWe are facing one of the most serious and decisive \nmoments in the history of the planet and the human \nrace. At this unprecedented moment, the Organization \nwill have to take serious decisions in order to honour its \nresponsibility to our peoples with concrete results. The \nGovernments of the world need to focus their efforts \non raising the level of discussion so that our ambitious \ncontract with humankind and our planet can be fulfiled \nin time. Not to do so in the face of all the destructive \nforces that exist on the face of the Earth, and to allow \nthe passions that lead peoples and nations to conflict \nand war to be unleashed, would be to lose one of the last \nremaining opportunities for humankind. \n"

        "file_text": "I come from \nthe South. At the conjunction of the Atlantic and the \nRiver Plate, my country is a gentle, temperate plain \nwhere livestock graze. Its history is one of ports, leather, \nsalted beef, wool and meat. There were dark decades of \nlances and horses until finally, with the outset of the \ntwentieth century, we were at the forefront of social, \neducation and governmental affairs. I would say that \nsocial democracy was invented in Uruguay. \n\nFor nearly 50 years, the world saw us as a kind of \nSwitzerland, but in reality in economic matters we were \nthe bastard children of the British Empire. When the \nempire ended, we experienced the bitter and terrible \nterms of trade and we yearned for the past for almost \n50 years, remembering Maracan\u00e1. Today, we have \nre-emerged in a globalized world, having learned from \nour pain. \n\nMy personal story is that of a boy \u2014 because I \nonce was a boy \u2014 who like others wanted to change his \ntimes and his world and dreamed of a free and classless \nsociety. My mistakes were in part the results of my era. \nObviously I take responsibility for them, but sometimes \nI cry: \u201cIf only I had the strength that I had when we \nenjoyed such utopia!\u201d\n\nHowever, I do not look towards the past because \nwhat we have today was created from the fertile ashes \nof yesterday. On the contrary, I am not on this planet \nto settle scores or to reminisce. I am greatly anguished \nby the future that I will not see, and to which I have \ncommitted myself. Yes, it is possible to have a world \nwith more humanity, but perhaps today the main task \nis to save life.\n\nI am from the South and I have come from the \nSouth to this Assembly. I share with the thousands of \npoor compatriots in cities, in the jungles, in the plains, \nin the pampas and the canyons of Latin America the \ncommon fatherland that we are creating. I bear upon \nmy shoulders the indigenous cultures, the remains \nof colonialism in the Malvinas, and the futile and \nregrettable blockades of Cuba under the Caribbean \nsun. I also bear the consequences of the electronic \nsurveillance, which does nothing but create the distrust \nthat poisons us needlessly. I also come with a huge \nsocial debt and with the need to defend the Amazon, the \nseas, and our great rivers of America. I also have the \nduty to fight for all on behalf of my fatherland and so \nthat Colombia can finally regain peace. I have the duty \nto fight for tolerance for those who are different and \nwith whom we have differences and disagreements. We \ndo not need tolerance for those with whom we agree. \nTolerance is the foundation of peaceful coexistence, \nunderstanding that we are all different in this world. \n\nI fight against the illicit economy, drug trafficking, \ntheft, fraud, corruption \u2014 the contemporary scourges \nunleashed by an opposite set of values and by those \n\n\n\f\nwho maintain that we are happier when we are richer, \nno matter by what means. We have sacrificed the old, \nimmaterial gods and we are now occupying the temple \nof the Market God. This god organizes our economy, our \npolitics, our habits and our lives, and even provides us \nwith rates and credit cards and the illusion of happiness. \nIt seems that we have been born only to consume, and \nwhen we can no longer consume we are overcome by \nfrustration, poverty and self-loathing.\n\nIt is true that today, in order to spend and to bury \nour garbage in what science calls the carbon footprint, \nif in this world we aspired to consume like the average \nAmerican, we would need three planets in order to be \nable to live. In other words, our civilization has mounted \na deceitful challenge, and as we go on it is not possible \nfor everyone to achieve that goal. Indeed, our culture is \nincreasinglt driven by accumulation and market forces. \nWe are promised a life of spending and squandering; \nin fact, it is a countdown against nature and against \nfuture humankind. It is a civilization against simplicity, \nagainst sobriety, against all natural cycles; worse yet, it \nis a civilization against freedom, which requires time to \nexperience human relationships and the most important \nthings: love, friendship, adventure, solidarity and \nfamily. It is a civilization against free time that does \nnot pay, that cannot be bought and that allows us to \ncontemplate the beauty of nature.\n\nWe have destroyed the real jungles and sown \nanonymous cement jungles. We have tackled a \nsedentary lifestyle with walking, insomnia with pills, \nsolitude with electronics. Can we be happy when we \nare so far from the human essence? We have to ask \nourselves this question. Stupefied, we have rejected our \nown biological imperative, which defends life for life\u2019s \nsake as a superior cause, and we have replaced it by \nfunctional consumerism and accumulation.\n\nPolitics, the eternal mother of all human \nendeavours, has remained shackled to the economy \nand to the marketplace.Going from one adventure to \nanother, politics achieves little more than perpetuating \nitself, and as such it delegates its power and spends its \ntime bewildered, fighting for the Government. Out of \ncontrol, human history marches forward, buying and \nselling everything and innovating in order to negotiate \nwhat is, in a way, non-negotiable. Marketing exists for \neverything: cemeteries and funeral services, maternity \nwards, fathers, mothers, grandparents, uncles, \nsecretaries, cars and vacations. Everything is business. \nMarketing campaigns deliberately target children and \npsychologically influence older children to reserve \nsafe territory for the future. Abundant evidence exists \nof such abominable uses of technology that sometimes \ninduce mass frustration.\n\nThe average city dweller wanders between financial \ninstitutions and tedious office routines, sometimes \nmoderated by air conditioning. He often dreams about \nvacations and freedom. He dreams about having the \nability to pay his bills until one day his heart stops and \nhe is gone. Other such soldiers will fall prey to the jaws \nof the marketplace, sharing in material accumulation.\n\nThe crisis really rests in the powerlessness of \npolitics, which is incapable of understanding that \nhumankind cannot and will not escape nationalism, \nwhich is practically etched into our DNA. Today, it is \ntime to fight to prepare a world without borders.\n\nThe globalized economy has no other driving force \nexcept that of the private interests of the very few, \nand each nation State seeks only to maintain its own \nstability. Today, the great task for our peoples and our \nhumble way of seeing things becomes the be-all and \nend-all. As if that were not enough, truly productive \ncapitalism is a prisoner of the banks, which are at the \nsummit of global power. More clearly, the world is \nclamouring for global regulations that respect scientific \nachievements, which abound, but it is not science that \ngoverns the world.\n\nToday, we need a lengthy agenda of definitions. We \nmust define working hours throughout the world. We \nneed to have convergence among currencies. We need \nto finance the global struggle for water and against \ndesertification. We have to figure out how to recycle \nmore and how to counter global warming. What are the \nlimits of each human task?\n\nWe must achieve a broad planetary consensus to \nunleash solidarity among the most oppressed and to \npunish and tax waste and speculation by mobilizing the \nlarge economies not to produce disposable goods, but \nrather useful goods without planned obsolescence or \nexcess, which would help the world\u2019s poorest peoples. \nUseful goods could stand against world poverty. Turning \nto a useful neo-Keynesianism on a global scale in order \nto abolish the world\u2019s most flagrant embarrassments \nwould be a thousand times more profitable than making \nwar.\n\nPerhaps our world needs fewer global organizations, \norganized forums and conferences, which serve only \nto aid hotel chains and airlines; perhaps no one really \n\n\n\f\nbenefits from their decisions anyway. We must return \nto what is old and eternal in human life, along with \nscience that strives to serve humankind, and not only \nthe rich. With scientists, the counsellors of humankind, \nwe can create agreements for the entire world. Neither \nthe large nation States nor transnational companies, not \nto mention the financial system, ought to govern the \nworld of humanity. Yes, lofty politics combined with \nscientific wisdom \u2014 it must come from science, which \nis not attracted by material gain but looks towards the \nfuture and tells us about things we may not foresee. \nHow many years ago did they tell us in Kyoto about \ncertain facts linked to climate change?\n\nWe have finally learned that intelligence must be \nat the helm, guiding the ship to port. Actions of this \nnature and others that we cannot name, yet which we \nbelieve to be crucial, require life and not acquired \nwealth. Obviously, we are not so na\u00efve; these and other \nthings like that will not come to pass. Many pointless \nsacrifices still lie ahead of us. We still must deal with \nthe consequences and not tackle the causes. Today, the \nworld is incapable of establishing global regulations for \nthe planet, due to the failure of lofty global politics, \nwhich meddles with everything.\n\nFor a time, we were protected by more or less \nregional agreements, established to create a deceitful \nso-called free trade that in the end constructed \nprotectionist, supranational barriers in some regions \nof the globe. In turn, important branches of industry \nand services dedicated to saving and improving the \nenvironment will arise. We will be comforted by that \nfor a while. We will be distracted. \n\nBut of course, the accumulation will continue \nunabated, to the delight of the financial system. Wars \nand fanaticism will continue until nature calls us to \naccount and makes our civilization non-viable. Perhaps \nour vision is too crude, not compassionate enough, \nand we view man as a unique creature, the only one on \nEarth capable of acting against his own species.\n\nI reiterate that what some call our planet\u2019s ecological \ncrisis is the result of the overwhelming triumph of \nhuman ambition. This is our triumph and our defeat, \ngiven our political impotence to fit into the new era that \nwe have helped to build without realizing it.\n\nWhy do I say this? The numbers tell the story. \nThe truth is that the global population quadrupled and \ngross domestic product grew by a factor of at least \n20 over the past century. World trade has doubled \napproximately every six years since 1990. We could \ncontinue to list numbers that clearly establish the \nmarch of globalization. What is happening to us? \nWe are entering a new era, and rapidly, but with our \npolitical bodies, cultural accessories, parties and young \npeople all reduced to old age before the horrific and \naccelerating changes that we cannot even grasp. We \ncannot manage globalization because we do not think \nglobally. We do not know if this is a cultural limitation \nor we are reaching biological limits. \n\nThe portents of revolution are present in our age \nas in no other in the history of humankind, yet our age \ndoes not have a conscious direction or even a basic \ninstinctive direction, and still less organized political \ndirection, because we do not have even the beginnings \nof a philosophy with which to face the speed of \noncoming changes. \n\nThe greed that has been such a negative force and \nsuch a driver of history has also pushed forward the \nmaterial, scientific and technical progress that has \nmade our era and our time what it is and has enabled a \nphenomenal leap forward on many different fronts. At \nthe same time, this very tool \u2014 the greed that pushed us \nto domesticate science and transform technology \u2014 is \nparadoxically pushing us over the edge into a shadowy \nabyss, towards an unknown fate, an era without history, \nand we are left without eyes to see or the collective \nintelligence to continue to colonize and transform \nourselves. \n\nIf there is one thing that defines this tiny little \nhuman creature, it is that it is an anthropocentric \nconqueror. It seems that things come alive and submit \nto men. Glimpses of these things abound everywhere, \nglimmers that should allow us to discern these things, \nor at least make out the direction in which things are \nheaded, but it is clearly impossible to make collective, \nglobal decisions about the big picture. Individual greed \neasily triumphs over our species\u2019 greed. Let us be clear. \nWhat is the big picture of which we speak? It is the \nsystem of global life on Earth, including human life, \nwith all the fragile balances that make it impossible for \nus to continue as we are.\n\nOn the other hand \u2014 and this is less contentious and \nmore obvious \u2014 in the West in particular, because we \nare indeed from the West, though we are also from the \nSouth, the republics arose to make the claim that men \nare equal, that no one is better than anyone else, and \nthat Governments should represent the common good, \njustice and equity. Often, these republics become warped \n\n\n\f\nand fall into the habit of ignoring ordinary people, the \nman on the street, the common people. Republics were \nnot created to outgrow their constituents, but instead \nare historical phenomena designed to function for their \nown people. They must therefore answer to majority \nand must fight for its interests.\n\nAs for the traces of feudalism that persist in \nour societies, or the domineering classicism, or the \nconsumer culture that surrounds us all, in the course \nof their existence republics often adopt a way of daily \nlife that excludes and holds at arm\u2019s length the common \nman. In fact, that common man should be the central \ncause of the republic\u2019s political struggle. Republican \nGovernments should increasingly look like their \nrespective peoples in the way they live and the way they \ndeal with life. \n\nThe fact is that we tend to cultivate feudal \nanachronisms, spoiled affectations and hierarchical \ndistinctions that undermine the best feature of \nrepublics \u2014 the fact that no one is better than anyone \nelse. The interaction of those factors and others keeps \nus living in prehistory, and today it is impossible to \nrenounce war when politics fails. Thus, economies are \nstrangled and resources wasted. Every minute in the life \nof our planet, we spend $2 million on military budgets \naround the world \u2014 $2 million a minute. Medical \nresearch on all manner of diseases, which has made \nhuge advances and is a blessing that promises longer \nlife, receives barely a fifth of what is budgeted for the \nmilitary. That process, from which we cannot escape, \nperpetuates hatred, fanaticism and distrust, fuels new \nwars and wastes fortunes.\n\nI know that it is very easy politically to criticize \nourselves at the national level, and I think it naive \nin this world to propose that resources that could be \nsaved and spent on other, useful things. Again, that \nwould be possible if we were capable of making global \nagreements and working on global prevention and \nworld policies aimed at ensuring peace and offering \nthe weakest among us guarantees that do not exist. \nEnormous resources would have to be cut to address \nthe most shameful things on Earth, but one question \nsuffices. Where can humankind as it is today go \nwithout those guarantees? Thus, each wields arms \ncommensurate with his size. \n\nAnd that is where we are today, because we can \nbarely reason as individuals, let alone as a species. \nGlobal institutions, especially today, languish in the \nshadow of the dissenting great nations. Clearly, such \nnations wish to hold on to power. They block action \nby the United Nations, which was created in the hope \nand with a dream of peace for humankind. But what \nis even worse is that they have cut it off from global \ndemocracy. We are not all equal. We cannot be equal \nin a world where some are strong and others weak. As \na result, our world democracy is wounded, and we face \nthe historical impossibility of reaching a global peace \nagreement. We patch up diseases when an outbreak \noccurs as one or other of the great Powers wishes, while \nwe look on from afar.\n\nIt would be difficult to invent a force that is worse \nthan the chauvinistic nationalism of the great Powers. \nNationalism, a force that liberates the weak through \nthe process of decolonization, has become a tool of \noppression in the hands of the strong. The past two \ncenturies are full of examples. The United Nations is \nlanguishing and becoming increasingly bureaucratic \nfrom lack of power and autonomy, above all of \nrecognition of democracy for the weak of the world, \nwho are the majority. \n\nBy way of a very small example, our little country \nis in absolute terms the largest Latin American \ncontributor of soldiers to peacebuilding missions, \nand we go wherever we are asked to go. But we are \nsmall and weak, and in the places where resources are \ndistributed and decisions made, we cannot go even to \nserve coffee. In our heart of hearts we long to help \nhumankind emerge from prehistory \u2014 and people who \nlive with war are still living in prehistory, despite the \nmany artifacts they can build \u2014 but as long as we do \nnot emerge from prehistory and retire war as a resort \nwhen politics fails, that is the long march and challenge \nwe have ahead of us. We say that in full awareness; we \nare familiar with the loneliness of war.\n\nSuch dreams, however, require us to fight for an \nagenda of world agreements that can begin to steer our \nhistory and overcome life\u2019s threats, step by step. Our \nspecies should have a Government for all humankind \nthat supersedes individualism and creates political \nleaders who follow the path of science and not merely the \nimmediate interests of those governing and suffocating \nus. At the same time, we must understand that the \nworld\u2019s poor are not from Africa or Latin America; \nthey are all part of humankind, and that means that we \nmust help them to develop so they can lead decent lives. \nThe necessary resources exist. They can be found in the \nwaste of our predatory civilization. \n\n\n\f\nA few days ago a tribute was delivered in a fire \nstation in California. An electric bulb had been turned \non for 100 years. It had been on for 100 years! How many \nmillions of dollars have they taken from our pockets \ndeliberately creating junk so that people will buy and \nbuy and buy? But globalization means a brutal cultural \nchange for our planet and for our life. That is what \nhistory demands from us. The entire material basis has \nchanged and it has changed man. In our culture, we act \nas if nothing had happened. Instead of us controlling \nglobalization, it controls us. \n\nAlmost 20 years ago, we discussed the humble \nTobin tax, which could not be applied at a global level. \nAll of the banks with financial power rose up against it. \nTheir private property and who knows how many other \nthings would be harmed. However, that is the paradox. \nWith talent and collective work, with science, step by \nstep humankind can make deserts green; humankind \ncan bring agriculture to the seas; humankind can \ndevelop agriculture that lives with salt water. \n\nIf the power of humankind is focused on what is \nessential, it is infinite. Here we see the greatest sources \nof energy. What do we know about photosynthesis? \nAlmost nothing. There is a great deal of energy in \nthe world, if we work together to use it properly. It \nis possible to eliminate poverty from the planet. It is \npossible to create stability. It will be possible for future \ngenerations, if they begin to reason as a species and \nnot just as individuals, to bring life to the galaxies and \npursue this dream of conquest that we, human beings, \nhave in our genes. \n\nBut if those dreams are to come true, we will have to \ncontrol ourselves or we will die. We will die because we \nare not capable of being at the level of the civilization \nthat we have been developing with our efforts. That \nis our dilemma. We should not spend our time merely \ncorrecting the consequences. Let us consider the deep-\nrooted causes, the civilization of waste, the present \ncivilization that is stealing time from human life and \nwasting it on pointless matters. \n\n\nLet us remember that human life is a miracle. \nConsider that human life is a miracle, that we are \nalive as a result of a miracle, and that nothing is more \nimportant than life. Our biological duty is, above all, to \nrespect life, promote it, take care of it, reproduce it and \nunderstand that the species is our being.\n\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at the outset, on \nbehalf of the President of the Republic of Suriname, His \nExcellency Mr. Desir\u00e9 Delano Bouterse, and the people \nand the Government of Suriname, to congratulate \nyou, Mr. President, on your well-deserved election. \nWith your election you bring honour to your country, \nAntigua and Barbuda, and to the Caribbean. With your \nbackground in sustainable development, you are well \nprepared to lead us in our deliberations on this year\u2019s \ntheme, \u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: setting the \nstage\u201d. I assure you of the support and cooperation of \nSuriname during your presidency.\n\nI should also like to take this opportunity to pay \ntribute to your predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremi., for his \nleadership during the sixty-seventh session of the \nGeneral Assembly. Furthermore, I commend Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his management of the United \nNations with regard to peace and security in various \nparts of the globe.\n\nSetting a new stage urgently requires much effort \nat the national as well as the international level to \nachieve the ultimate goal of improving the standard of \nliving of our peoples and bringing about the sustainable \ndevelopment of our countries. The Millennium \nDevelopment Goals are an important first step towards \naddressing some of the worst socioeconomic conditions \nfacing approximately 40 per cent of humankind, \ntargeted as they are at reducing the worst manifestations \nof underdevelopment.\n\nIn our view, the success of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals depends on two sets of simultaneous \nactions: first, a reorientation of national responsibilities; \nand, second, of equal importance, the reorientation of \nthe international community. Such reorientation will \nenable us to chart a more meaningful path towards \nmeeting the targets of the Millennium Development \nGoals and moving towards the post-2015 Development \nagenda.\n\nThat is particularly relevant if we take heed of the \n2013 report on the Millennium Development Goals, \nwhich reveals some rather interesting facts, such as: \nmost developing countries are performing well in \nmeeting the targets; and developed countries, which \nhave committed themselves to Goal 8 by making their \naid pledges viable and effective, are nevertheless well \nbehind in their general performance in meeting the \ntargets.\n\nOfficial development assistance is in constant \ndecline, and the agreements concluded in 2001 within \nthe context of the World Trade Organization to improve \naccess to international markets have been stalled during \nthe Doha Round. That stalling has proved to be so \nharmful that dealing with market access on behalf of the \npoorest nations has been left out of subsequent agendas. \nFurthermore, as we all know, the ongoing financial \nand economic crisis is having a detrimental impact \non developing nations because official development \nassistance is drastically declining.\n\nClearly, a number of large developing countries, \nmainly in Asia, as well as some countries endowed with \nnatural resources in Africa and South America, have \nmade substantial economic progress. Their statistics, \nhowever, should not blind us to the fact that inequality \nis rampant and that almost 1.2 billion people are still \nliving in extreme poverty and do not have access to \naffordable and adequate health services, while millions \nof children are still denied their right to primary \neducation.\n\nWe have learned the important lesson that developing \ncountries are obliged to undertake adequate measures \nto strengthen economic interactions among themselves \nin addition to ties with their traditional trading partners \n\n\n\f\nin the North. We must give substance to South-South \ncooperation. That is an important consideration for \nsetting a new stage for global sustainable development. \nIn this context, foreign direct investment is considered \nto be a factor of vital importance.\n\nIt is encouraging to note that a number of countries, \nincluding my own, Suriname, have been upgraded \nfrom low-income status to middle-income status by \ninternational financial institutions and United Nations \nagencies. Our efforts to develop prudent macroeconomic \nand appropriate fiscal policies, combined with our \ninitiatives to diversify our economy, and the sacrifices \nborne by our people, have led to this improved status. \nApplying per capita income as the major indicator for \ndetermining our development status has, however, \nmanoeuvred us into a position where we have lost \naccess to the necessary concessional loans and grants. \nThe conclusion can be drawn that our people are being \npunished for their ability to overcome some of the \nobstacles that have made them less fortunate in the past.\n\nWithin this interdependent world, we will continue \nto build on our own strength as the main driving \nforce for the achievement of our development agenda. \nFurthermore, we believe that building upon national \nstrengths, within the context of participation in \nsubregional and regional cooperation frameworks, is \nthe right way forward to finding proper solutions for \ndevelopment. On the basis of what has been achieved \nat the regional level, a global approach might become \nmore feasible.\n\nSuriname shares the view that we should base the \npost-2015 development agenda on a people-centred \napproach, with a specific focus on the most vulnerable \nin society, in particular, women, youth, the elderly \nand people with disabilities. In so doing \u2014 and \nthis \nwe emphasize \u2014 we should strike the right balance \nbetween our positive macroeconomic situation and a \nmicro situation that is in dire need of improvement.\n\nWe are in the course of developing policies and \nprogrammes to fight non-communicable diseases that \nhave led to decreased productivity. Non-communicable \ndiseases have now become the leading cause of death in \nSuriname and in other countries in our region. There is \nspecial emphasis on improving education and bringing \nit closer to our socioeconomic reality. We intend to work \nmore closely with relevant international organizations \nsuch as the Pan American Health Organization, the \nWorld Health Organization, UNESCO, UNICEF and \nothers.\n\nThe Government also attaches great importance \nto issues involving young people. In this regard, a \nlarge-scale after-school programme with the aim of \nenhancing better learning for youth deserves mention. \nThe successful experiences in regional cooperation \nmechanisms, such as the one in the Caribbean \nCommunity (CARICOM), as well as the one that is \nbeing considered in the Union of South American \nNations (UNASUR), are clear examples of how youth \ncan contribute to the connectivity between peoples and \nthe enhancement of unity.\n\nTaking into account global processes and cognizant \nof the opportunities and challenges from CARICOM \nand UNASUR, the post-2015 development agenda \nshould emanate from an inclusive, intergovernmental \nprocess. That process should be directed towards: the \ncontinued eradication of poverty; a people-centred \napproach, combining economic activity with the social \nneed for education and health care, thereby promoting \nthe welfare and well-being of all; and the integration of \neconomic and social action and strengthening of human \ncapital.\n\nGlobal warming has a direct negative impact on \nthe development of small island developing States \nand low-lying coastal States, including Suriname. \nSuriname shares its grave concern regarding the state \nof the global climate and the stalled United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change process. \nThe Government of Suriname strongly recommends \nthat the General Assembly face these challenges by \nmaking them part of the post-2015 development agenda.\n\nIn setting the stage for development goals \nbeyond 2015, we cannot ignore the various threats to \ninternational peace. International peace, security and \nhuman rights are indispensable in creating an enabling \nenvironment for sustainable development. Suriname \nis well aware of the fact that national sovereignty \nand national security are seriously affected by the \nindiscriminate use of violence in fighting terrorism \nand other forms of transnational organized crime. \nChallenges related to armed conflicts, poverty, food, \nthe environment, education, public health, migration \nand energy require increased collaboration. In this \nrespect, partnership among Governments, international \nand regional organizations and civil society is a must. \nWe applaud the South American and Caribbean nations \n\n\n\f\nfor their efforts towards regional peace and stability. \nTheir willingness and capacity for further dialogue and \npersuasion is a better way to achieve and maintain peace \nthan the use of violence and military intervention.\n\nWe are proud to belong to a region that has declared \nitself a nuclear-weapon-free zone.\n\nWe express the hope that the two-State solution to \nthe Palestinian-Israeli conflict will gain more substance, \nallowing the peoples of both countries the prospect of \npeace and prosperity. Suriname maintains the position \nthat the multilateral process within the United Nations \nshould prevail in the search for a peaceful solution for \nthe crisis in Syria.\n\nThe Cuban people have the right to participate \nas full members in all regional organizations, and we \nstrongly urge that all obstacles that have prevented \ntheir full participation so far be removed, including the \noutdated and inhuman unilateral economic, financial \nand commercial embargo.\n\nWith regard to the Republic of Haiti, the \ninternational community tends to lose attention for \nthe necessary follow-up activities to get Haiti back \non its feet. Once again we call upon the international \ncommunity to fulfil its commitments.\n\nIn closing, I take advantage of this opportunity \nto inform the Assembly that, exactly 30 days ago, \nmy country, Suriname, took over the pro tempore \npresidency of the Union of South American Nations, \na young and vibrant regional body. We pledge that \nSuriname will, during its presidency, further the goals \nof UNASUR and contribute to international peace, \nsecurity and sustainable development.\n"

        "file_text": "I would \nfirst like to congratulate Mr. John Ashe of Antigua \nand Barbuda on his election to the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-eighth session and to \nwish him every success in his post. I am confident that \nhis diligence and perspicacity will contribute to our \nefforts to address the challenges of today\u2019s world. I \nwould also like to express my appreciation for the work \nof Mr. Vuk Jeremi. in presiding over the Assembly at \nits sixty-seventh session and my best wishes for his \nfurther success in his career. And I pay tribute to the \nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his tireless \nwork promoting peace and security, human rights and \nprosperity in a sustainable global environment, as \nwell as for his efforts to make this Organization more \ntransparent and efficient.\n\n\n\f\nBefore the key points of my statement, I would like \nto offer my condolences to the victims of the senseless \nattack in Kenya.\n\nThe United Nations is in the midst of establishing \na new post-2015 development agenda that will continue \nand advance the ambitious commitments laid down \nin the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). We \nwelcome the inauguration earlier this week of the High-\nlevel Political Forum on Sustainable Development as a \nkey step towards the implementation of the outcome \ndocument of the 2012 United Nations Conference on \nSustainable Development (resolution 66/288, annex). \nWe expect that the high-level dialogue will reinforce \nand launch the implementation of the three pillars \nof sustainable development \u2014 economic prosperity, \nsocial equity and environmental protection \u2014 with \nthe firm commitment of Member States to deliver \non those priority areas. We recall the huge effort it \ntook for this Organization to agree last year in Rio \non the wide-ranging framework for a world working \ncooperatively towards a sustainable future, and we are \nhopeful that this effort will yield results sooner rather \nthan later.\n\nFor the Republic of Moldova, sustainable \ndevelopment is the only way to ensure a decent life \nfor our people. It follows that we must foster economic \ndevelopment and solve our energy security problems \nwhile ensuring an ecologically healthy environment. \nMy Government has been working hard to achieve \nthose ends, together with its relevant international \npartners, particularly the European Union (EU), \nwhich gives us a reference point for our national \npolicies. We are convinced that political will, mutual \nassistance and transparency in every significant issue \ncan bring just as much positive change to emerging and \ndeveloping economies as to poor ones. We reaffirm that \nissues such as poverty eradication, human rights and \ntolerance, access to quality education without gender \ndiscrimination, decent jobs for all and the preservation \nof nature and biodiversity should have special priority \non the United Nations development agenda in the years \nto come.\n\nCooperation between sectors is also a key issue, \nwhich is why international partners and the donor \ncommunity, including the private sector and civil \nsociety, should work hand in hand with the United \nNations and Governments in order to mobilize the \nnecessary resources and use them to target specific \nresults-oriented projects as well as investments in \nessential areas.\n\nI would also like to touch on the problems of \nmigration and population movement. The United \nNations has acknowledged more than once that \nmigration can benefit the development of countries of \norigin as much as that of countries of destination, if \ninternational cooperation is strengthened and suitable \npolicies are put in place. That is certainly the case \nwith the Republic of Moldova, where migration has \ncontributed to our macroeconomic stability in recent \nyears. \n\nAt the same time, we are living through a period \nof considerable change that is likely to influence the \ndemographic, economic, social and security aspects \nof our population. There is no doubt that investing \nin human capital is fundamentally a way out of \ndemographic volatility and an indispensable condition \nfor our country\u2019s prosperity, while ensuring respect \nfor human rights. That is how we aim to reduce the \ninterdependence between development and migration \nflows and to create an environment conducive to \ncommunity development, including small and medium-\nsize businesses, with financial aid awarded directly \nfrom the State budget.\n\nHowever, I would also like to draw the attention \nof the Assembly to the positive examples derived from \nthe mobility partnership between the Republic of \nMoldova and the European Union. That initiative has \nstrengthened the Government\u2019s capacity to formulate \nand implement migration policies, find shared priorities \nwith the EU and develop innovative and strategic \nlegislative initiatives, based on best practices. We must \ndefinitely continue in that spirit, which is the only way \nto arrive at mutually acceptable solutions for regular \nand circulating migration that can benefit our citizens, \nwhile ensuring that human rights are protected and \nsocial security guaranteed.\n\nI would like to mention here one of the most \nsignificant achievements of the Assembly, the adoption \nof the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), which was made \npossible after several years of intense debate and \nnegotiation on the regulation of the world\u2019s arms trade.\n\nThe Republic of Moldova has signed the ATT, and \nwe hope that the rapid entry into force of the Treaty \nwill make the global arms trade more transparent and \nlegitimate. The ATT could be a great step forward \nin controlling the proliferation and illicit circulation \n\n\n\f\nof weapons, especially in vulnerable areas and in \nareas that do not respect the constitutional system of \nsovereign States.\n\nIn addition, the Government is working closely with \nits European and international partners, in particular \nwith Germany\u2019s Federal Office of Economics and \nExport Control and the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe, to review and amend national \nlegislation on the export control of dual-use goods in \norder to adopt the best international standards and rely \non the best international experience in that field.\n\nAs a member of the Human Rights Council, my \ncountry has completed the first cycle of the universal \nperiodic review, which is, in our opinion, one of the \nbest exercises for monitoring and evaluating the \nresults of national human rights institutions and \nmechanisms. At the same time, we agreed to undertake \nnew commitments to meet the challenges involved in \nimplementing the recommendations of the universal \nperiodic review.\n\nThe Republic of Moldova continues to advocate for \na review of the human rights situation by all countries \nand States and believes that a robust, apolitical and \nimpartial Human Rights Council should exercise \ngreater authority, especially in cases of serious human \nrights violations, and should provide guidance on the \nimplementation of the best practices and standards in \nthis area.\n\nMy Government is pleased to announce the fourth \nseminar of Francophone countries, to be held at the \nbeginning of 2014, in Chisinau, our capital, to discuss \nthe results of and lessons learned from the first cycle of \nthe universal periodic review. We hope that the findings \nof that seminar will contribute to the advancement, \nstrengthening and improvement of the universal \nperiodic review as a unique mechanism for the review \nof human rights practices in all States members of the \nInternational Organization of la Francophonie.\n\n(spoke in English)\nThe Republic of Moldova is pursuing an intensive \nand comprehensive reform programme in the political, \neconomic, institutional, legislative, demographic and \njudicial areas and others. We are firmly committed \nto building a State based on the rule of law, good \ngovernance, transparency and accountability. Through \nthose difficult efforts, we are becoming a stronger \nnation and a better international partner, and we must \nkeep pushing ahead.\n\nIn that connection, we are proud to announce that \nthe Government has embarked on a new course of \ntechnological modernization to enable direct public \naccess to Government services. Our aim is to make all \nsuch Government services electronically available to \nall citizens by 2020 at any time, from anywhere, using \nmodern communication technologies and devices such \nas computers, mobile phones and interactive payment \noffices. Such a system will combat corruption, reduce \nunnecessary bureaucracy and ensure true transparency \nin the relationship between citizens and public officials. \nThe Republic of Moldova is among the leaders in \nthat field, and our efforts have already yielded real \nbenefits for our citizens with the implementation of our \nelectronic catalogue for public services, mobile digital \nsignatures, the Government\u2019s electronic payment portal \nand many more services.\n\nThe ambitious reform agenda of the Government and \nits foreign policy are both directed towards the fulfilment \nof our country\u2019s strategic objective \u2014 European \nintegration. At this stage, we have concluded the \nnegotiations on the Association Agreement with the EU \nand its component part, the Deep and Comprehensive \nFree Trade Area Agreement, and the initialling of the \ntexts is going to take place at the upcoming Eastern \nPartnership summit to be held in Vilnius in November. \nAll of those actions \u2014 the political association with the \nEU, the economic rapprochement and the perspective \nof visa-free travel for our citizens \u2014 are bringing us \ncloser to our final goal, namely EU integration, and \nthey open new perspectives for political and economic \ncooperation in the region.\n\nEvery year, my delegation brings to the attention \nof the Assembly the issue of the protracted conflict \nin the Transnistrian region, which has affected my \ncountry ever since independence. As a nation that \nvalues national consolidation and unity, that conflict is \na constant challenge that undermines our development \nefforts. The political settlement of the conflict and the \nreintegration of the country are our strategic priority. \nWe envisage uniting the population from both banks of \nthe Dniester River around shared goals and providing \nthem with a better future. It also means removing one \nof the most fundamental challenges to our national \nsecurity, economic development and social cohesion. \nUltimately, resolving the Transnistrian conflict means \nguaranteeing secured national borders and opening a \nnew perspective towards stability and fruitful, bilateral \nand equitable relations with our neighbours and \ninternational partners.\n\n\n\f\nPeace and dialogue are fundamental prerequisites \nfor a political solution to any conflict. Let me emphasize \nthat there have now been more than two decades of \npeace in the region, and we will spare no effort to \npreserve that peace. Moldova is fully committed to \ndialogue through all available channels. But in order to \nachieve the desired outcome, we desperately need trust \nwithin the resolution process and genuine engagement \nand commitment from the outside. We advocate for the \ncontinuation of the confidence-building activities that \nhave been taking place since 2007 with the support of \nthe United Nations Development Programme and the \nEuropean Union, aimed at bridging the gaps between \nall stakeholders from both banks and involving local \nauthorities, business communities and civil society.\n\nThe vision of the Government of the Republic \nof Moldova for a final solution to the conflict is \nunambiguous and inclusive. First, a comprehensive \nand viable solution must be based on respect for the \nsovereignty and territorial integrity of the country. We \nare open to a reasonable compromise on a special status \nfor the region within the Republic of Moldova, which \nwould provide the population from the left bank with \na comfortable and guaranteed level of self-governance \nin various areas of public life. There should be a single \nconstitutional, economic and defence space within \nthe internationally recognized borders of Moldova. \nAt the same time, the Republic of Moldova should \nremain a functional State that continues to advance on \nits European path and makes every effort to allow the \npopulation and the business communities from both \nbanks to benefit equally from our extensive partnership \nwith the European Union and, hopefully, within the \nEuropean Union.\n\nOn the conflict resolution matter, we will continue \nwith renewed impetus to seek solutions in order to ensure \nthe freedom of movement, improved transportation \nlinks and new and real opportunities for businesses on \nboth banks of the Dniester. We will also redouble our \nefforts to convince our partners to start talks on political \nand security issues, including the future status of the \nregion within the recognized borders of the Republic \nof Moldova. Moreover, we will seek to intensify law-\nenforcement interaction and preserve stability in the \nsecurity zone, and we reaffirm our stance on the need \nto transform the current peacekeeping mechanism into \nan international civilian mission.\n\nStrengthening respect for human rights is of utmost \nimportance to us. The report of the United Nations senior \nexpert on human rights in the Transnistrian region of \nthe Republic of Moldova, Mr. Thomas Hammarberg, \noffers a good road map for joint activities in that regard. \nIn addition, I would like to reiterate our long-standing \nand unwavering call to finalize the withdrawal of the \nRussian military forces and ammunition from the \nterritory of the Republic of Moldova in accordance with \nthe relevant international commitments.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to express my \nGovernment\u2019s conviction that the future of the region \nwill be brighter if we unite our efforts in building a \nstronger and unified country, open to Europe where \nit naturally belongs, and to diversity, tolerance and \neconomic and market opportunities. We are optimistic \nthat we can achieve that because there is no better \nvision that we could embrace for the well-being of our \npeople and the consolidation of our nation. \n\nThe Republic of Moldova places peace and real, \nconstructive dialogue above any political goal or \nambition. We follow with great concern the continuing \nviolence in the Middle East and abhor the loss of so \nmany lives and futures, which will perhaps irremediably \nmaim the consciousness of a whole generation, not \nonly in the conflict zones but worldwide. The refugee \ncrisis in Syria magnifies the perils of war, Hundreds \nof thousands of people have been displaced as they \ntry to salvage their lives and find peace. My own \ncountry has offered protection to a number of Syrian \nrefugees, and we recognize the significant burden that \nSyria\u2019s neighbours and other receiving countries, many \nin Europe, face as they seek to alleviate the Syrian \nrefugees\u2019 suffering, offer them a better chance for \nsurvival and affirm their basic human rights. It is time \nfor all sides to take a step back, find a peaceful solution \nand build a future for their people rather than pursue \nfleeting, treacherous and, so often, deadly political \ngoals.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to express the hope that \nduring the current session the members of the Assembly \nwill succeed in reaching important decisions on topical \nissues, such as sustainable development, peace and \nsecurity, human rights and many others. My delegation \nis willing and open to making its contribution in a \ncollaborative and constructive way. \n"

        "file_text": "I bring to all warm \ngreetings and the good wishes of the Afghan people. \nI have the honour to address the General Assembly \nin the last year of the current elected Government of \nAfghanistan. I therefore think that it is useful briefly to \nrevisit the story of Afghanistan over the past 12 years, \nour historic successes, the achievements that have \ntransformed Afghanistan and, yes, the challenges we \nhave faced continuously during that time. I should \nthen like to share with the Assembly the vision of \nthe Afghan people and Government for the future of \nfreedom, dignity, prosperity and democracy that we \nare striving to solidify in our country and, briefly, to \naddress the critical importance of our relations and \ncooperation with countries in our region and with the \nbroader community of nations.\n\nTo better illustrate the journey that Afghanistan \nand its noble people have been on over the past 12 years, \nI should like to share two contrasting pictures of the \nreality of Afghanistan \u2014 in the year 2001, at the time of \nthe collapse of the Taliban regime, and in the year 2013, \nas we are going through a historic period and a process \nof transition.\n\nFor a little more than two decades prior to November \n2001, when the Afghan people ousted the Taliban regime \nfrom power, with military backing from the United \nStates-led international military coalition, the people \nof Afghanistan suffered incalculable pain, deprivation \nand losses through three distinct periods. Between \nthe communist coup in 1978, followed by the invasion \nof our country in 1979, and the fall of the communist \nregime, more than 1 million Afghan men, women and \nchildren were killed, more than 2 million were made \norphans or left with severe war wounds, and more than \n5 million were forced out of their villages and towns \ninto refugee camps in neighbouring countries, mainly \nin Pakistan and Iran, as a result of the brutality of the \noccupation and the communist regime and in the course \nof our resistance against that occupation. We fought for \nour freedom and independence \u2014 our holy jihad \u2014 and \nwe won, in the process helping the national freedom \nand independence movements in Eastern Europe.\n\nThe international community that had supported our \nstruggle for several years abandoned us when the defeat \nand withdrawal of the Red Army became apparent. \nExploiting the vacuum and internal strife created during \nthe early 1990s, the foreign-backed Taliban movement \nrose to power and quickly controlled more than 90 per \ncent of Afghan territory. Then, equally quickly, they \nremoved their masks and revealed their true identity, \nholding the Afghan nation hostage and embarking on a \nperiod of particularly cruel and barbaric violence and \ncruelty under the guise of Islam. With their backward \nviews, violence and brutal suppression of the rights and \nfreedoms of the Afghan people, especially women, they \nturned our country against itself. The international \ncommunity did not mobilize to take action against the \nTaliban regime until the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the \nUnited States, including in this city.\n\nAt the end of 2001, when, with the military backing \nof the United States-led international coalition, we were \ngetting ready to drive the Taliban regime from power, \n\n\n\f\nAfghanistan was in near-total isolation from the region \nand the world community. The Afghan people were a \nterrorized population, without rights or freedoms and \nwithout protection from the Taliban regime\u2019s brutality. \nSevere poverty and disease were endemic, with little \nor no access to health-care services. The education \nsystem, which completely excluded women and girls \nand had fewer than half a million male students \nattending schools and universities, was a catastrophic \nfailure. The average annual per capita income was \nabout $100 and the country lacked a single national \ncurrency. Our roads, bridges, irrigation networks and \nother components of critical national infrastructure \nwere completely destroyed. Afghanistan was without \na national army or a national police force, and all our \nother State institutions had been reduced to nothing. In \nshort, Afghanistan was a failed State, ruled by a proxy \nmilitant group that provided shelter to international \nterrorists, thus posing a real danger to regional and \ninternational peace and security.\n\nThe situation in Afghanistan during that period \nwas indeed bleak. The Afghan people had little hope for \ntheir own or their children\u2019s future. However, following \nthe Al-Qaida terrorist attacks in the United States, the \nAfghan people came together and, with support from the \nUnited States and a multitude of other friends and allies \nin the international community, removed the Taliban \nfrom power and embarked upon a new era of hope, \nreconstruction, development and progress \u2014 a new \nera marked by an entirely different reality. Primarily \nas a result of our own sacrifices and the considerable \nsacrifices and support of our international friends and \nallies during our 12-year partnership, Afghanistan once \nagain has become the home of all Afghans, men and \nwomen, where they enjoy equal rights and freedoms \nunder our democratic Constitution.\n\nToday Afghanistan is a forward-looking young \ndemocracy with functioning State institutions, an elected \nPresident, an elected Parliament and elected provincial \ncouncils in each one of our 34 provinces, backed up by a \npowerful civil society movement. Afghan independent \nmedia, with approximately 50 independent television \nchannels, more than 100 community FM radio stations \nand hundreds of print publications, are arguably among \nthe freest in the region. Today there are more than \n20 million mobile-phone users across Afghanistan, \nan increasing number of them accessing information \nand using various platforms on the Internet. Per capita \nincome has increased from $100 a year to $600 a year, \nour national currency has been consistently stable, \nand our trade ties with the outside world are rapidly \nexpanding.\n\nToday in the new Afghanistan the number of children \nattending school stands at well over 10 million, 40 per \ncent of them girls, and there are hundreds of thousands \nof young men and women attending some 70 public \nand private colleges and universities. More than 70 per \ncent of our people today have access to basic health-\ncare services. That, among other things, has increased \naverage life expectancy from approximately 40 years to \nmore the 60 years in just one decade.\n\nWe have built thousands of kilometres of roads, \nirrigation canals, bridges and other pieces of our \ncountry\u2019s critical physical infrastructure, thereby \ncutting travel time and facilitating trade and movement \nwithin the country and with neighbouring countries. \nAfghanistan today is a proud and active member of \nthe international community, while managing its ever-\nexpanding relations and cooperation with countries and \norganizations throughout the world, through a network \nof some 70 diplomatic and consular missions.\n\nThe examples of rejuvenation and development, \nprogress and achievements that I have just described \nrepresent the true picture of today\u2019s Afghanistan. \nConsidering that 12 years is not a very long time in \nthe history of a country, especially a country such as \nAfghanistan, which has gone through more than 35 \nyears of war and destruction, those achievements and \ngains are nothing short of a historic transformation. \n\nI have drawn that clear contrast between the \nAfghanistan of 10 years ago and the positive reality of \ntoday for two main reasons: first, to underscore a model \nof collective action and international cooperation in \nsupport of one country\u2019s efforts to establish peace, \nsecurity and development; and, secondly, to counter \na narrative of doom and gloom for Afghanistan by \nthose who are ignorant about our progress, or who \nharbour ill-will towards us. The new Afghanistan is \nindeed currently going through a critical period of \nsecurity, economic and political transition that comes \nwith its difficulties and challenges but that is helping \nus to consolidate our fledgling democratic order and \nstrengthening our national sovereignty, independence \nand ownership of our own affairs.\n\nThat is the vision of the Afghan people and \nGovernment for the years leading up to the completion \nof the transition in 2014 and into the transformation \ndecade of 2015 to 2024. In the security area it is our \n\n\n\f\nmore than 350,000 brave and professional soldiers \nand police officers \u2014 not foreign soldiers \u2014 who are \ndirectly responsible for the security of more than 90 per \ncent of the Afghan population. The transfer of security \nresponsibilities from the international forces to Afghan \nnational security forces, launched in the summer of \n2011, will be completed throughout the country by \nthe end of 2014. Our forces have demonstrated their \ncourage, commitment and effectiveness in successfully \ntaking over from their international partners. It is \nthrough the enormous and selfless sacrifices of our \nproud and patriotic national security forces on a daily \nbasis that security in most cities and towns that have \ngone through transition has improved and the Taliban \nhave been beaten back. We are fully confident that, with \nthe continued financial assistance of the international \ncommunity for equipment and other requirements and \nneeds, as pledged at the Chicago NATO Summit in May \n2012, Afghan national forces will be able to provide \nsecurity to the Afghan people and defend the country \nagainst external threats.\n\nParallel to our ongoing efforts to enhance the \ncapacity and capabilities of our national security \nforces, the Afghan Government is pursuing a political \nprocess of peace and reconciliation with the Taliban. \nThe key principles and conditions for that process \nare clear: respect for Afghanistan\u2019s Constitution, \nwhich guarantees full and equal rights to Afghan \nmen and women; the preservation and enhancement \nof the advances made over the past decade; and the \nrenunciation of violence against the population.\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Pakistan, a major neighbour, \ncan play a key role in supporting our peace process. \nWe have been heartened by the recent successful visit \nto Islamabad by President Karzai and the positive and \nconstructive dialogue that took place between the two \nGovernments during that visit. We look forward to \nfurther steps and progress in the weeks and months to \ncome. Pakistan\u2019s essential role in advancing the Afghan \npeace process is a clear example of the support that \nAfghanistan\u2019s neighbours and other countries in the \nregion, especially Muslim countries, can provide to the \nAfghan peace process.\n\nAs far as the economic component of transition \nis concerned, the presence of a large international \nmilitary force over the past 10 years has generated \nemployment and income opportunities for thousands of \nour citizens, so it is natural that there will be an adverse \nimpact resulting from the withdrawal of those forces. \nIn addition to our best efforts to fulfil Afghanistan\u2019s \nrole as the trade, transit and economic integration \nroundabout in the heart of Asia region for the benefit \nof all people of the region, the Afghan Government is \nkeen to reduce the negative economic impact of the \ninternational military withdrawal and to strengthen our \nnational economy in at least three ways. \n\nThe first is by focusing on the development of the \nagriculture and agribusiness sector, in which more than \n70 per cent of our population is directly or indirectly \nengaged, and where there is enormous potential for \ngrowth and employment generation. \n\nSecondly, Afghanistan is estimated to hold trillions \nof dollars of natural resources, including minerals and \nhydrocarbons, representing a guaranteed source of \nwealth and income for generations to come. We already \nhave several State-owned and private companies \u2014 from \nChina, India, the United Kingdom, Canada, Turkey, the \nUnited Arab Emirates and other countries, in addition \nto Afghan companies \u2014 expressing a keen interest in \ninvesting billions of dollars in copper, iron ore, gold, \nrare-Earth minerals, oil and gas. We are actively \nseeking to attract additional foreign investment to this \nsector, while remaining duly diligent to make sure that \nour natural riches serve the goal of a strong legitimate \nnational economy and improved prosperity and welfare \nfor the Afghan people.\n\nThirdly, the Tokyo Conference last July pledged \nmore than $16 billion through 2015 to help the Afghan \nGovernment fill its projected fiscal gap. Conference \nparticipants also committed to providing additional \nfinancial assistance to Afghanistan beyond 2016 at \nor near the levels of the past decade. That generous \nfinancial support will be critical in tiding us over the \nnext few years.\n\nIn addition to the security and economic transitions, \nwe have a crucial political transition coming up next \nyear, namely, the presidential and provincial council \nelections. Next year\u2019s presidential elections will mark \nthe first time in our history that one elected President \nwill transfer power to another elected President \nthrough a peaceful democratic process. The Afghan \nGovernment is doing everything possible to ensure \nfree, fair and credible elections, so that the Afghan \npeople can choose who the next President will be. A \nsuccessful presidential election will entrench our \ndemocratic process and greatly contribute to our efforts \ntowards lasting peace, security and prosperity.\n\n\n\f\nAs we go forward in implementing the transition \nagenda and preparing for the transformation decade, \nanother key foundation of our long-term success will \nbe the strategic partnerships we have forged with some \nof our closest friends and allies over the past few years. \nSince October 2011, when we signed our first long-term \nstrategic partnership agreement with the Republic of \nIndia, we have entered into similar partnerships with the \nUnited States, Germany, Australia, France, the United \nKingdom, Italy, Norway, Finland, Denmark and Poland. \nWe have also concluded or are currently negotiating \nsimilar partnerships with the European Union, Turkey \nand the United Arab Emirates. In that regard, I should \nlike to reiterate the Afghan Government and people\u2019s \nappreciation for the solid and broad-based expression of \nlong-term political support for a peaceful, prosperous, \ndemocratic Afghanistan by more than 100 countries \nand organizations at the historic international Bonn \nConference, kindly hosted by the German Government \nin December 2011. \n\nWith the United States, we are negotiating a \nseparate bilateral security agreement that will define \nthe parameters of the long-term security and defence \ncooperation between our two countries. I should like \nto reiterate our long-standing principled position that \nany bilateral security agreements that Afghanistan \nsigns with other countries, including the United States, \nwill be purely for the purpose of ensuring peace, \nsecurity, development and the consolidation of our \nyoung democracy, and not directed at our neighbours \nor any countries in the region. Afghanistan belongs to \nits region. As recent history has clearly demonstrated, \nthe peace, security and stability of Afghanistan, as the \ncentre of the heart of Asia region, has a direct impact \non the peace, security and stability of the entire region, \nand vice versa. We want Afghanistan to serve its \nrightful role as a key land bridge in our vital region \nfor the flow of people, goods and investments. In that \ncontext, the Istanbul Process on Regional Security and \nCooperation for a Secure and Stable Afghanistan, which \nwe launched together with our Turkish friends and all \nother participating and supporting States in November \n2011, is of vital importance for confidence-building \nand promoting results-oriented cooperation. \n\nTwo follow-on ministerial meetings, in Kabul in \nJune 2012 and in Almaty in April of this year, have \ntaken the Process to the level of maturity. It has now \ndeveloped into a meaningful forum for discussion on \nspecific confidence-building measures and enjoys \nconsiderable momentum. As the permanent co-Chair \nof the Process, the Afghan Government is particularly \ngrateful to the People\u2019s Republic of China for hosting \nthe next ministerial meeting next summer.\n\nIn addition to improving cooperation and confidence \non a whole range of other issues, all countries in our \nregion, and our allies and friends in the international \ncommunity, must continue decisively to confront \nthe single biggest challenge that still endangers our \ncollective peace and security and undermines the \nwelfare of our people, namely, the continuing menace \nof terrorism and extremism and their sanctuaries and \nsupport systems in the region. We will not achieve the \nfull potential of our citizens or realize true and lasting \npeace and security in Afghanistan or the wider region \nuntil we have dealt decisively with the brutality and \nevilness of the terrorists who try to harm us every day. \nFortunately, we are more hopeful now than in the past \nabout a gathering common approach against terrorism \nand extremism in our region. \n\nThis year\u2019s General Assembly session is taking place \nat a time in which the United Nations has seen a number \nof conflicts continue, while new ones have taken shape. \nIn Syria, we watch the ongoing immeasurable suffering \nof the great people of that country. Afghanistan calls \nfor an immediate halt to the violence there, which has \ntaken the lives of more than 100,000 people, forced \nmore than 2 million Syrians to become refugees and \nleft 6.8 million people in urgent need of humanitarian \nassistance. We strongly support a political solution, \nreached through a broad-based national dialogue that \nmeets the aspirations of all Syrians. Moreover, the \ninternational community must provide the support \nnecessary to address the humanitarian needs of those \naffected by the conflict, including the millions who \nhave sought refuge in neighbouring countries. \n\nSpeaking of long-standing conflicts, none is more \nevident than the decades-long strife between Palestine \nand Israel. Following years of deadlock and impasse, \nwe see that renewed efforts for a peaceful settlement \nhave emerged with the resumption of direct negotiations \nbetween the two sides. That is an important development, \nwhich we hope will result in durable peace, enabled by \nthe establishment of an independent Palestinian State. \nWe also hope to witness the inclusion of the State of \nPalestine as a full Member of the Organization.\n\nIn conclusion, as I stand before the Assembly, I \nfeel more strongly than ever that our shared vision of a \nworld free from violence, conflict and destitution will \nbe achieved only if we put our differences aside and act \n\n\nas one. If we adhere to the principles of understanding, \nsolidarity and cooperation, we will be able to secure our \ncollective future, as evidenced in the historic successes \nwe have achieved in Afghanistan over the past 12 years.\n\nThe United Nations has been a reliable partner in \nhelping us come this far. As we prepare to embark upon \nthe transformation decade, we expect the Organization \nto continue its support through a renewed approach that \nreinforces Afghanistan\u2019s leadership and ownership. Let \nme also assure the Assembly that, as we in Afghanistan \nwork to preserve our gains and consolidate our young \ndemocracy in the crucial years ahead, we will remain \nan active Member of the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Defining the post-2015 \nstrategy for development is among the most important \nlong-term multilateral agendas existing today. The task \nis complex, but the mission \u2014 to make our common \ndevelopment sustainable \u2014 should be clear. It is not just \na synonym for the protection of the environment. The \nmission is to make sure that our societies, economies, \nenvironment and partnerships will serve us all and \nserve the generations to come.\n\nBy 2030, our population will be 9 billion people, \n65 per cent of whom will live in cities, forming \nconsumer societies with ever-growing demands but \nusing the same or a declining pool of natural resources. \nCivil societies and other non-governmental players have \nmore influence than ever on our values and decisions. \nWe are racing against climate change. Our perceptions \nof progress, equity, inequality, affluence and resource \nmanagement are changing as we speak. The post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda has to reflect these changes.\n\nAs we face a turning point in our history and the \nstate of the Earth, it is only with a fundamental shift in \nmindset that humanity will succeed in a transition to \nglobal sustainable development. We have to accelerate \nprogress towards the goals set out in the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. However, we know that by 2015 \nwe may not be able to meet all the targets we set in \n2000. Therefore, the next important step is to create \na single agenda through which we will complete the \nunfinished business and make sure that the results \nwill last even in the light of the tremendous challenges \nfacing humankind.\n\nWe should aim at eradicating extreme poverty \nin a single generation. The transformation to \nsustainable development is costly; however, it would be \nincomparably more costly to miss the chance. We should \nlearn from past mistakes and find better alternatives. \nWe all need economic growth. We all need justice, \nrespect for human rights, gender equality, dignity, good \ngovernance and successfully implemented national \ndevelopment plans. We all deserve to live free of want \nand from fear of devastating conflicts. Our objective \nshould be not a zero-sum game but a win-win outcome. \nWe all share the consequences; therefore we should be \naware of our common responsibility as well.\n\nThe decisions we make today will also need to be \nrelevant in 15 years. When our successors look back \nin 2030 on the agenda we are about to decide on, they \nshould acknowledge the purpose, priorities and targets \njointly set. They should be convinced that our action \nhad the right impact and made this world a better place. \nI thank the Member States for the confidence they \n\nhave shown in Hungary by entrusting us to co-chair \nthe Open Working Group on Sustainable Development \nGoals. We will do our best to achieve a consensual, \nforward-looking, win-win formula as the outcome of \nthe negotiating process.\n\nHungary attaches the utmost importance to the \nissue of water and sanitation. We believe that it needs \nto be addressed in an integrated way to achieve a \nhuman rights-based social development prosperity and \necological balance. Water is a source of life, health, \nprosperity and a shared future, but it can also be a \nsource of risk.\n\nIn order to take stock of the various international \ndevelopments in the field of water, Hungary has \ndecided to organize the Budapest Water Summit, to \nbe held in our capital from 8 to 11 October. Hungary \nis a downstream country with about 95 per cent of all \nfluvial waters originating beyond our State borders. We \nhave accumulated precious know-how in flood control, \ndrinking water, wastewater treatment and irrigation, \njust to list a few. The Summit will be accompanied by \na science forum, a youth forum, a civil society forum, \na business leaders\u2019 forum and Expo, and a philanthropy \nround table. We look forward to welcoming Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon and the United Nations agencies \nactive in the field of water, as well as other international \nand national leaders to the conference. More than 100 \ncountries and international institutions have confirmed \nthey will be represented in Budapest. The Summit \nwill adopt the Budapest Statement, and we hope that \nit will, as a synthesis document, greatly contribute to \nand facilitate the discussions and negotiations on the \nsustainable development goals.\n\nThe appalling situations in various parts of the \nworld leave no doubt as to the interdependence and \nmutually reinforcing nature of democracy, peace and \nsecurity, development and human rights. A cross-policy \napproach that takes account of those interrelationships \nshould be integrated into the work of the various bodies \nand forums of the United Nations.\n\nHungary welcomes the measures that the United \nNations system is introducing to mainstream human \nrights. Likewise, it encourages national initiatives \nand contributions to the protection of human rights. \nHungary remains dedicated to the promotion of human \nrights and fundamental freedoms. It was in this spirit \nthat the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Hungary \nestablished the annual Budapest Human Rights Forum, \nintended to apply an interrelated philosophy to address \ncurrent human rights challenges. The next Forum is \ndue to take place in November and will be dedicated, \namong other things, to the relationship between human \nrights and sustainable development.\n\nHungary is committed to disarmament and \nnon-proliferation efforts, which are fundamental for \nmaintaining global peace and security. We urge all \ncountries to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention. \nWe also support the establishment of a zone free of \nweapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, as \nforeseen by the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties \nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons.\n\nMy country was greatly honoured to chair the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s International \nConference on Nuclear Security in July and sincerely \nhopes that the results of that Conference will contribute \nto a safer world.\n\nOn the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty \n(CTBT), I am confident that its entry into force will \ngreatly strengthen global peace and security. Only \na treaty in force will confine the chapter on nuclear \ntesting to the history books. We therefore need to \nfurther intensify our respective efforts. I and my \nfellow article XIV Coordinator Mr. Marty Natalegawa, \nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, will make an \nattempt to bring us closer to that goal. I look forward \nto our co-coordinatorship of the CTBT for the period \n2013-2015 with a view to accelerating the ratification \nprocess.\n\nThe use of chemical weapons in Syria was a \ncrime against humanity. The international community \nhas finally embarked on action to ensure that similar \nattacks will never be repeated. We urge that the \nperpetrators of all war crimes be brought to justice. \nWithout justice there is no reconciliation. Without a \nchance for reconciliation, there is no lasting settlement. \nWe welcome the United States-Russia agreement on \nthe framework for the elimination of Syrian chemical \nweapons as well as the consequent resolutions adopted \nby the Executive Council of the Organization for the \nProhibition of Chemical Weapons, and the Security \nCouncil. We look forward to a timely, transparent and \nfull-scale implementation under the watchful eyes of \nthe international community.\n\nHungary is ready to provide chemical and biological \nexperts on the ground to facilitate those international \n\n\n\f\nefforts. We urge the Syrian authorities to take full \nresponsibility to ensure that their chemical weapons are \nstored securely until inspection and destruction, and do \nnot fall into the hands of any other State or non-State \nactor. Syria should live up to its commitments, including \nby providing full access to the international inspectors.\n\nWe hope that these developments will bring us \ncloser to a lasting and sustainable political solution, \nwhich should remain the backbone of our efforts in \nthe Syrian crisis. Well over 100,000 lives have already \nbeen lost and 5 million people displaced in this conflict. \nMost regrettably, it was only after a terrible chemical \nattack last August that the Security Council became \nready to fulfil its duties and embarked on action. I urge \nall partners in the international community to seize \nthis momentum and reinvigorate the process leading \nto the long-overdue \u201cGeneva II\u201d international peace \nconference on Syria.\n\nLast, but not least, my country is shocked by and \nstrongly condemns the surging terrorist attacks against \ncivilians at the Westgate Mall in Kenya, students in \nNigeria, and Christian, Muslim and other communities \nin Pakistan, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Our \nsolidarity and sympathy go to the innocent victims.\n"

        "file_text": "Once again, we have \nwitnessed outrageous acts of terrorism against innocent \npeople, most recently in Kenya, Iraq and Pakistan. \nOur thoughts go out to the victims and their families. \nIt is the primary responsibility of all Governments \nto protect their citizens. A few weeks ago, the world \nwitnessed the use of chemical weapons in Syria. It \nis hard to find words strong enough to express our \ncondemnation. International law has been violated, war \ncrimes committed and globally shared values have been \nshattered. Those responsible must be held accountable \nand should answer to the International Criminal Court.\n\nThe devastation inflicted on the Syrian people \nmust end. A country is in ruins. Innocent lives are lost \nevery day, more than 6 million people are displaced \nand stability in the region is threatened. The Syrian \nGovernment has not lived up to its responsibility \ntowards its own citizens. It has retaliated with \nunabated violence instead of choosing a path of reform, \nreconciliation and improved rights for its people. The \ncrisis calls for firm action to be taken by the international \ncommunity. Syria must comply with its international \nobligations, and all parties to the conflict must respect \nhumanitarian and human rights law. We welcome the \nadoption of Security Council resolution 2118 (2013) and \ncall on the Council to ensure that Syria fully meets its \ncommitments. The Geneva communiqu\u00e9 (S/2012/522, \nannex) must also be honoured and a \u201cGeneva II\u201d \nconference convened urgently.

Within these \nwalls, the history of international relations continues to \nbe written and brave new steps to be taken. The latest \naccomplishment is the adoption of the Arms Trade \nTreaty. Iceland is proud to have been the first State to \nratify this landmark treaty. We call on all States \u2014 in \nparticular arms exporters \u2014 to do so as well, so that it \nenters into force without delay.\n\nIn the year 2000, world leaders gathered in this city \nand made a historic decision by adopting the Millennium \nDeclaration. Since then, the Millennium Development \nGoals have served us well. For almost 15 years, they \nhave influenced and guided the development priorities \nof nations and organizations. They have increased \nawareness of heartbreaking poverty and inspired new \npolicymaking. The Millennium Development Goals \nare indeed central to Iceland\u2019s development policy, and \nmy Government is firmly committed to shouldering \nour responsibility in a globalized world. As new goals \nare defined, the focus should remain on eliminating \npoverty, achieving gender equality, improving health \nand providing education for girls and boys.\n\nThe pressure on our ecosystem calls for urgent \naction to combat pollution and land degradation, as \nwell as a balanced consideration of conservation and \nthe utilization of natural resources. It is a challenge to \nensure food security when land and water resources are \nthreatened. Our duty is to share experiences and know-\nhow to restore land and improve land management \u2014 to \nchange deserts into blooming fields.\n\nFurthermore, climate change and disasters such as \nthe one in Fukushima have taught us that a real energy \ntransformation is needed. Safe, clean and renewable \nenergy is the way of the future. Iceland has undergone \na true energy revolution. Today, almost all of our \nelectricity and heating needs are met with renewable \nenergy. That success story is a source of a productive \npartnership between Iceland and the United Nations, \nand now also the World Bank.\n\nOur world is wealthy. That wealth is not only \npreserved in the minerals of the Earth, the power of the \nrivers and the rich living marine resources. Our greatest \nwealth is people \u2014 the knowledge, the experiences, the \nconstant journey of the human mind to explore and \ninvent new solutions.\n\nIceland makes use of those assets in its development \ncooperation. We are proud to offer the world our \n\n\n\f\nexpertise where it can make a real difference \u2014 for \nthe development of geothermal energy, sustainable \nfisheries management, the restoration of fertile land \nand the promotion of gender equality. More than 2,500 \nexperts from all parts of the world have benefited from \nthe activities of the four United Nations university \ntraining programmes in Iceland since the first one was \nestablished 35 years ago. Iceland will focus on those \nsame four topics in the post-2015 process. Let me \nemphasize that the process must be conducted in a true \ndemocratic spirit. It must be inclusive and allow for all \nMember States to participate.\n\nAs I glance around the Assembly Hall, I am \ninspired by the history and success of the Organization, \nwhich represents the immense diversity and talent of \nhumankind, and inspired by the potential for future \npositive action that the rich fabric of representatives \nfrom all Member States represents. But success should \nnot blind our vision or cloud our judgement. The flaws \nof the Security Council have been sadly exposed in the \ncase of Syria. Furthermore, the lack of organizational \nreform undermines the credibility of the United Nations.\n\nMuch work remains undone in many areas. As \nlong as people are mistreated for their views, race \nor religion, or even cast as outlaws for their sexual \norientation or gender identity, human rights obligations \nare not honoured. We are alarmed that recent legislation \nin some countries is violating the fundamental \nprinciples of equality and the freedom of expression. \nThe responsibility to change that and to ensure the \nprotection and promotion of human rights rests with us \npoliticians. By speaking from this rostrum, each and \nevery one of us pledges to uphold those common values \nof the United Nations.\n\nThe promotion of gender equality and the \nempowerment of women is another urgent task. In \n2015, we will celebrate the twentieth anniversary \nof the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in \nBeijing. We call on all Member States to renew efforts \nto implement the Beijing Declaration and Platform for \nAction. Iceland has been advocating for celebrating the \nanniversary through a 12-month campaign, focusing \non each of the 12 themes of Beijing. We note that \nUN Women is planning its strategy along those lines.\n\nA prominent element in the Beijing Declaration is \nthe importance of the active engagement of women for \ndemocratic development. The women of the Arab world \nhave given that objective a powerful new meaning in \nthe past three years. Women assumed their rightful \nplace and have called on their leaders to show real \nleadership. They call for respect for human rights and \nthe equal treatment of women and men. They call for \nthe freedom to express their views and to determine \ntheir own future through democratic processes.\n\n\nIt is regrettable that developments in the region have \nbeen overshadowed by political discord and continued \nviolence. We deplore the loss of lives and condemn all \nviolence. We also call on the Governments in the region \nto demonstrate their commitment to democracy with \nconcrete actions.\n\nThe developments in the Middle East cannot be \nseparated from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As \nUnited States President Obama said, the Palestinian \npeople have a right to live with security and dignity \nin their own sovereign State. Israel\u2019s security depends \nupon the realization of a Palestinian State, and stability \nwill be served only through a two-State solution and \na secure Israel. We welcome the renewed peace talks \nbetween the State of Israel and the State of Palestine \nand applaud United States Secretary Kerry for his \ncommitment in that regard. We must respect the right \nof the Palestinian people to self-determination as well \nas Israel\u2019s right to exist in peace with its neighbours. \nBut time is running out.\n\nThe continuing settlement activities, in violation \nof international law, threaten to make the two-State \nsolution impossible. Therefore, the Government of \nIsrael must end all settlements in the West Bank, \nincluding East Jerusalem. We denounce the oppressive \npolicies of Hamas and condemn the indiscriminate \nrocket fire from Gaza. We also call upon Israel to end \nthe blockade of the territory.\n\nRespect for international law is fundamental \nfor relations between States. If differences arise, we \nshould always seek agreements through consultations, \nnegotiations or other means for peaceful resolution. \nThe principle of the rule of law, which is among the \nfounding principles of the United Nations, is vital to us \nall \u2014 big nations and small.\n\nOne international agreement that Iceland holds in \nhigh regard is the United Nations Convention on the \nLaw of the Sea. It was a great achievement when that \nimportant Convention was adopted 30 years ago, and \nit has proved its relevance by the test of time. The \n\n\n\f\nLaw of the Sea Convention demonstrates how the \ninternational order can best work and prescribes how \ndifferences should be settled through peaceful means. \nThe Convention provides a basis for sound resource \nmanagement. However, meeting that objective is \ndifficult for many States. The international community \nshould do much more to support developing countries \nto better conserve and utilize their resources and reform \ntheir management policies. As a steadfast advocate \nof the Convention, Iceland is firmly committed to its \nprovisions. We protest in the strongest terms when \nstakeholders resort to threats of coercive measures \nwhen differences arise.\n\nIcelanders know better than anyone that the health \nof the ocean and its resources must be preserved. It \nis fundamental for our existence and livelihood. The \nconservation, sound management and sustainable use of \nnatural resources are principles that we follow strictly \nin our policies. We are sincere and serious in living \nup to the responsibility that comes with safeguarding \nthe riches of the Earth. For the same reason, the eight \nArctic States have developed productive regional \ncooperation. As the world witnesses the rapid changes \nin the Arctic, we who live in that corner of the world \nknow how urgent it is to act and plan for the future. \nThe delicate environment must be protected, economic \nopportunities developed and the needs of the people \nwho live in the Arctic respected.\n\nAs caretakers of the Arctic, we take our global \nduty very seriously. It was therefore a great pleasure \nand an honour for me to host the Secretary-General in \nIceland last summer. During his visit, I demonstrated to \nhim how the global impact of climate change melts the \nglaciers in the north. Following our trip to the central \nhighlands, the Secretary-General observed that we had \nnot only seen the ice disappear, we had also heard the \nmost powerful sound of ice melting away.\n\nDuring his stay, the Secretary-General gave us \nIcelanders an insight into the work of the United \nNations \u2014 how, every single day, the United Nations \nis making a difference in the lives of countless \npeople around the world, helping refugees, providing \nhumanitarian assistance and saving the lives of \nchildren. The United Nations is a force for good in the \nworld. Together we can make a real difference; united \nwe protect the environment, preserve peace and save \nlives. The more united we are, the better the world will \nbecome.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, \nI would like to congratulate Mr. John Ashe on his \nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \nits sixty-eighth session and wish him every success \nin fulfilling this highly responsible duty. We are also \ngrateful to Mr. Vuk Jeremi. for his able presidency of \nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.\n\nThis year\u2019s general debate is taking place during \na period of serious threats and challenges to peace, \nsecurity and sustainable development. Environmental, \neconomic and social indicators demonstrate that \nthe models for progress and development need to \nbe modified and adapted. The theme of the current \ngeneral debate, \u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: \nsetting the stage\u201d, is timely and topical in providing \n\nan opportunity for evaluating the progress achieved so \nfar and identifying new ways of overcoming existing \nobstacles.\n\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \nwhich were adopted to address extreme poverty and \nmultiple other forms of deprivation and for defining \nfuture development priorities, are of key importance in \nmaking future positive differences in the world.\n\nAzerbaijan recently became a donor country and \ncontributes to the sustainable development efforts of \ncountries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. This is a \nbrand-new chapter in the history of my country and its \nactivities in the international arena. A national entity, \nthe Azerbaijan International Development Agency, \nwhich was established for that purpose, has already \ncarried out various assistance programmes in more \nthan 20 countries. The Heydar Aliyev Foundation \nhas also conducted various humanitarian and social \nprogrammes.\n\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the \nUnited Nations recently commended Azerbaijan\u2019s \nachievements in combating hunger and recognized that \nthe country has accomplished the first MDG, namely, \ncombating undernourishment. Moreover, gender \nequality, the empowerment of women and the fight \nagainst HIV/AIDS have also been identified as areas \nof progress.\n\nOne of the key elements that Azerbaijan is \nconsidering in the context of the post-2015 agenda is \ninformation and communications technology (ICT), \nwhich is a driving force of development and progress. \nTo achieve the objective of ensuring improved access \nto ICT, efforts must be intensified to enhance regional \nsynergies for promoting investment in ICT capacity-\nbuilding, refocusing tools and content so as to address \nthe particular needs of populations and thus better \ndeploying ICT in the service of sustainable development. \n\nIn that connection, Azerbaijan has put forward \na proposal to establish the Eurasian Connectivity \nAlliance, a regional platform in support of improved \nconnectivity and greater cooperation in the field of \nICT. We are encouraged by Member States\u2019 support for \nthat initiative through the adoption of resolution 67/298 \nin September and look forward to further cooperation \nwith interested Governments and other stakeholders.\n\nThe world is still witnessing violations of the \nfundamental norms and principles of international law. \nHundreds of thousands of people throughout the world \ncontinue to suffer from acts of aggression, military \noccupation, ethnic cleansing and a prevailing culture of \nimpunity for the most serious crimes of concern to the \ninternational community.\n\nTwenty years ago, in 1993, the Security Council \nadopted four resolutions \u2014 resolutions 822 (1993), 853 \n(1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993) \u2014 condemning the \nuse of force against Azerbaijan and the occupation of its \nterritories. In those resolutions, the Council reaffirmed \nrespect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of \nAzerbaijan, reconfirmed that the Nagorno Karabakh \nregion is an integral part of Azerbaijan, and demanded \nthe immediate, full and unconditional withdrawal of \nthe occupying forces from all the occupied territories.\n\nThe resolutions also made specific reference to \nviolations of international humanitarian law, including \nthe violent displacement of a large number of civilians \nin Azerbaijan, attacks on civilians and the bombing of \nits territory.\n\nA series of Security Council presidential statements \non the issue adopted between 1992 and 1995 are phrased \nalong the same lines. All in all, the aforementioned \nresolutions, which are clearly the most authoritative and \nbinding rulings on the problem, acknowledge that acts \nof military force were committed against Azerbaijan \nand that such acts constitute a serious violation of \ninternational law.\n\nTo our deep regret, the Security Council\u2019s principled \ndemands, including, in the first place, the withdrawal \nof occupying forces from the occupied territories of \nAzerbaijan, have still not been implemented, and the \nmediation efforts conducted for more than 20 years \nwithin the framework of the Organization for Security \nand Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), have yet to yield \nresults. Against that background, with a view to \ndeflecting the attention of the international community \nfrom the urgent need to address the main problems \ncaused by its continuing aggression against Azerbaijan, \nArmenia has been undertaking efforts to distort the \nactual situation and downplaying the relevance of \nSecurity Council resolutions and misinterpreting their \nprovisions. Moreover, Armenia\u2019s continued claims of \nannexation and the consistent measures it has been \nundertaking in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan \nwith a view to further consolidating the status quo of \nthe occupation and preventing the return of hundreds \nof thousands of internally displaced persons to their \n\n\n\f\nhomeland represent an open challenge to the conflict-\nresolution process and pose a serious threat to \ninternational and regional peace and security.\n\nOn our initiative at the United Nations in 2005 \nand 2010, OSCE-led fact-finding and fact-assessment \nmissions visited the occupied territories. Both missions \ndocumented the fact of illegal activities in those \nareas, involving, inter alia, the insertion of settlers, \nthe extensive redrawing of boundaries, the changing \nof original geographic names, and the discriminatory \ntreatment of cultural property and sacred sites. However, \nthe missions\u2019 recommendations remain just on paper. \nMoreover, the latest reports on the transfer of Syrian \nArmenians into the Nagorno Karabakh region and \nseven other adjacent occupied districts of Azerbaijan, \nalong with other illegal activities, including efforts to \noperate flights into and out of those territories, provide \nyet more evidence of Armenia\u2019s deliberate policy of \nannexing Azerbaijani land.\n\nIn that regard, it is critical that the international \ncommunity continue to insist on the need for an \nimmediate and unconditional end to all actions that \nare seriously obstructing the prospects of a negotiated \npeaceful settlement to the conflict. Armenia\u2019s policy of \nannexation has absolutely no chance of succeeding. The \nNagorno Karabakh region was, is and will always be an \ninalienable part of Azerbaijan. The only way to achieve \na durable and lasting solution and to establish civilized \nrelations between the two neighbouring States is to \nde-occupy Azerbaijani territories, fully re-establish \nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan, \nand comply immediately with the inalienable right \nof refugees and internally displaced persons to \nreturn to their homes. That is what international \nlaw and the relevant Security Council resolutions \nrequire, something that can in no way be introduced \nas a bargaining chip during the conflict-settlement \nprocess. Above all, Azerbaijan will never compromise \nits territorial integrity or the rights and freedoms of \nits citizens. Without prejudice to its rights under the \nCharter of the United Nations, in particular those set \nforth in Article 51, Azerbaijan has embarked upon, and \nremains committed to, the conflict-settlement process.\n\nWe have no doubt that the Azerbaijani and \nArmenian communities of Nagorno Karabakh will \none day live side by side in peace and dignity in this \nregion of Azerbaijan. It is therefore essential and \nvital to continue efforts towards peace, agreement \nand coexistence between the two communities of the \nNagorno Karabakh region. We consider those aspects \nto be an important part of the entire reconciliation \nprocess, which should be given the attention it deserves. \n\nAzerbaijan highly appreciates the principled \nstance of the States Members of the United Nations \nthat has been expressed on issues that are important \nfor Azerbaijan and pertaining to its sovereignty and \nterritorial integrity. We count on the continued resolve \nof the international community to defend the purposes \nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations, as \nwell as its strong solidarity with the just position of \nAzerbaijan.\n\nWe note the encouraging developments in the \nMiddle East peace process with the resumption of direct \nnegotiations between Israel and Palestine. The current \nsituation of insecurity in the whole region necessitates \nprogress in the peace process as never before. It is \nimperative that the parties demonstrate responsibility \nto sustain international efforts towards achieving the \ntwo-State solution and avoid actions that would risk \nundermining that objective. The economic, financial \nand humanitarian situation in Palestine requires \ncontinued international attention and assistance, \nparticularly in order to ensure humanitarian aid for the \nregion. \n\nIn June, Azerbaijan hosted a conference of the \nMinisters for Foreign Affairs of the Organization of \nIslamic Cooperation on the establishment of an Islamic \nfinancial safety net in support of Palestine, as well as \na donors conference in support of the city of Al-Quds. \nStates members of the OIC and other international \norganizations attending the conferences pledged to \ncontribute to improving Palestine\u2019s economy, health \ncare and education, as well as two infrastructure \nprojects. \n\nWe welcome yesterday\u2019s adoption of Security Council \nresolution 2118 (2013), regarding the safeguarding and \ndestruction of Syria\u2019s chemical-weapon stockpiles. \nWe hope that the unanimous and strong position \ndemonstrated by the Council will contribute to finding \na political solution to the conflict in Syria, putting an \nend to the suffering inflicted on the Syrian people and \nensuring that all parties concerned comply with their \nobligations and commitments under international law. \nAzerbaijan strongly condemns the use of chemical \nweapons in Syria, particularly the resulting killing of \ncivilians. Resolution 2118 (2013) affirms that the use \nof chemical weapons constitutes a serious violation of \n\n\ninternational law and qualifies such an act as a threat \nto international peace and security. By endorsing the \nGeneva communiqu\u00e9 of 30 June 2012 (S/2012/522, \nannex) and calling for the convening of an international \nconference on Syria, the Security Council paved the \nway for achieving a peaceful transition, stability and \nreconciliation. It is imperative that all parties cease \narmed violence, engage constructively in the political \nprocess and commit to the implementation of the \nGeneva communiqu\u00e9.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to express our hope \nthat during the sixty-eighth session of the General \nAssembly, Member States will be able to take \nsuccessful steps towards a stronger and more effective \nUnited Nations. We look forward to the continued \ncommitment and engagement of the United Nations \nsystem, both in reinforcing the implementation of \nnational development goals by individual countries and \nin ensuring the implementation of the decisions and \nresolutions adopted by the Organization.\n"

        "file_text": "I \ncongratulate Mr. John Ashe on his election as President \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. \nI convey my deep gratitude and appreciation to the \nSecretary-General for his work to strengthen the \nrole and effectiveness of the United Nations, fully \nsupporting the principles of the Charter of the United \nNations.\n\nI take this opportunity to emphasize my country\u2019s \nalignment with the positions of the European Union, \npresented by the President of the European Council, \nMr. Herman Van Rompuy, in his address (see \nA/68/PV.8).\n\nGreece remains fully committed to the objectives \nof the United Nations, whose universal ideals have \nnever ceased to inspire us. We are deeply committed \nto our collective work for sustainable peace, prosperity \nand safeguarding human dignity. In that spirit, we lend \nour full support to the efforts to reform and strengthen \nthe Organization in order to meet the challenges of the \ntwenty-first century.\n\nWe welcome the special event on the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and the High-Level \nPolitical Forum that took place this week and highlighted \nthe broad themes of international development and \ncooperation. \n\nThe effective management of migration can have \na positive impact on the countries of origin and of \ndestination. The High-Level Dialogue on International \nMigration and Development to be held on 3 and 4 October \npresents an important opportunity to develop a global \nagenda for the effective and inclusive management of \nmigration and to reaffirm the necessary political will. \nGreece is committed to participating actively in joint \nefforts to that end.\n\n\n\f\nGreece and the other countries of southern Europe \nare under great pressure with regard to the issue of illegal \nimmigration, which weighs heavily on our financial and \nadministrative capacities. The effective management \nof migration represents for our country a key political \noption in that it relates directly to safeguarding and \nrespecting human rights, social cohesion and public \nsecurity, and to maintaining the economic stability \nof our countries. On the basis of our experience of \nrecent years, we have reviewed our national action \nplan to reform the system of asylum and immigration. \nFurthermore, migration and mobility issues will be \namong the priorities of the Greek presidency of the \nEuropean Council in the first term of 2014.\n\nThe promotion of human rights is a priority interest. \nGreece will lend its full support to strengthening the \nHuman Rights Council with a solid mandate. Greece is \ndetermined to contribute actively to the mission of the \nHuman Rights Council and is presenting its candidature \nfor the 2017\u20132019 term. Greece is strongly devoted to \nthe decisive role of the United Nations in peace and \nsecurity. In spite of financial restraints, we remain \nfirmly committed to peacekeeping operations, to which \nwe contribute personnel and resources, including to the \nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. We support \nefforts to prevent conflicts and promote the peaceful \nsettlement of disputes. Moreover, we attach particular \nimportance to cooperation between the European \nUnion and the United Nations in the field of crisis \nmanagement, and we welcome the work undertaken to \nfurther strengthen that cooperation.\n\n(spoke in English) \nThe relaunching of peace negotiations between \nIsrael and the Palestinian Authority, facilitated by the \nUnited States, provides an important opportunity to \nreach a final settlement to this long-standing problem, \nto the benefit and stability in the wider region, based \non a two-State solution with a secure Israel and a \nsovereign, contiguous and viable Palestine living side \nby side. Prime Minister Netanyahu and President \nAbbas must be praised for their leadership and courage \nto engage in the peace talks. Now is the time to take \nbold and concrete steps towards peace.\n\nGreece is very concerned with the ongoing \ncrisis in Syria, which jeopardizes stability in a very \nfragile region. Greece and the European Union have \nunequivocally condemned the use of chemical weapons, \nand we strongly support the United States-Russian \nFederation initiative for the collection and destruction \nof Syria\u2019s chemical arsenal. We welcome the diplomatic \nbreakthrough expected to be achieved by the Security \nCouncil on the destruction of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons. \nIt is our fervent hope that it will be a crucial turning \npoint in the Syrian crisis, providing vital momentum \ntowards a \u201cGeneva II\u201d-type process that can take us to \na viable and inclusive political resolution of the Syrian \ncrisis.\n\nGreece has always been a firm supporter of a \nEuropean future for the Balkan region. The process \nof European integration means leaving behind old, \ndivisive mentalities and moving towards an era of close \ncooperation, on the basis of shared values and principles. \nDemonstrating political courage, Belgrade and Pristina \nconcluded an historic agreement in April, which is a \nmajor development towards consolidating peace and \nstability in the Western Balkans and advancing the \nEuropean integration of both sides.\n\nWe seek to develop our relations with the former \nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia on the basis of the \nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and \nwithin the framework of good neighbourly relations. \nGreece is committed to the ongoing United Nations-\nled negotiation process and to finding a solution on \nthe issue of a name. We therefore continue our efforts \nto reach a mutually acceptable name for all uses, erga \nomnes, that will leave no grey areas and allow for a clear \ndistinction between our neighbouring country and the \nregion of Macedonia in northern Greece. The solution \nof the name issue will enable both Greece and its \nneighbour to develop multidimensional and productive \ncooperation at the bilateral and regional levels. It will \nalso contribute to the stability and prosperity of South-\nEast Europe and boost the country\u2019s Euro-Atlantic \naspirations.\n\nThirty-nine years after the Turkish military invasion \nof the island, the Cyprus problem remains first and \nforemost an issue of illegal military occupation of well \nover one third of the territory of a Member State of the \nUnited Nations and European Union. A comprehensive \nagreed settlement of that major international problem is \na top priority for the foreign policy of Greece. In that \ncontext, Greece greatly values the Secretary-General\u2019s \nmission of good offices, in particular his ongoing efforts \nto successfully relaunch the intercommunal negotiating \nprocess. We also fully support President Anastasiadis\u2019 \nrenewed constructive package proposal.\n\nWe hope that Ankara will decide at long last to \npursue a new policy of normalization of its relations \n\n\n\f\nwith the Republic of Cyprus. Such a Turkish policy \nwould decisively facilitate the relaunching of \nintercommunal negotiations on a just and viable \nsolution to the Cyprus issue within the framework of \nthe relevant Security Council resolutions, in line with \nthe acquis communautaire and approved by the Cypriot \npeople through a referendum. The new developments \nin the energy sector regarding the exploitation of \nhydrocarbons can serve as a factor for development, \npeace and stability throughout the region.\n\nRelations with our neighbour Turkey are set on \na positive course. Institutionalized cooperation at \nthe highest governmental level, as well as increasing \ntourism and economic cooperation, can create further \npotential for the future. Nevertheless, critical factors \nneeded to promote substantial and promising prospects \nfor our relationship with our eastern neighbour are full \nrespect for international law and international legality \nand, within this framework, a just and viable solution \nto the Cyprus issue.\n\nThe Greek people have succeeded in restoring \nthe country\u2019s credibility. Greece has already \nachieved the highest structural primary surplus in the \nEurozone \u2014 5 per cent of gross domestic product. Greece \nhas achieved a peacetime historical first \u2014 a fiscal \nadjustment of 19 per cent of gross domestic product \nin the four years from 2009 to 2013. We have done so \nin spite of six years of recession. We have carried out \nnecessary structural reforms in public administration, \nthe investment sector and the labour market, and our \nprivatization programme is already yielding results. But \nall of that has, of course, come through great sacrifices \nborne by the Greek people and at a very high social \nand political cost. Defending democracy and the rule of \nlaw against forms of racist, xenophobic conduct and all \nforms of social violence is a fundamental engagement \nof the Hellenic Republic.\n\nI also wish to say a few words about the priorities \nof Greece\u2019s upcoming presidency of the Council of the \nEuropean Union in the first half of 2014. Coming at \na time of unprecedented economic challenges for the \nUnion, our presidency will carry forward the vital \ndebate on the future of Europe \u2014 a debate that will \nintensify as we approach next year\u2019s European elections.\n\nAll the issues that humankind is facing and that are \nbeing dealt with by General Assembly at this session \nhighlight the need to enhance the role of the United \nNations and to further consolidate the institutions of \nglobal economic and political governance. The hopes of \nthe international community are oriented towards the \nUnited Nations. Our Organization has to send a strong \nand clear message of peace, security and prosperity \nto the peoples of the world, particularly the younger \ngeneration.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, on behalf \nof the people and the President of the Bolivarian \nRepublic of Venezuela, Mr. Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Moros, I \nwould like to convey to General Assembly President \nJohn Ashe our congratulations on his recent election to \nlead this organ of the United Nations. \n\nAs is known, President Maduro Moros is not here \nat this session of the General Assembly because of a \nwhole range of delays, obstacles, conditions imposed \nand lack of guarantees for him and members of his \ndelegation, imposed by the Government of the United \nStates in flagrant violation of the obligations incumbent \nupon it under the Headquarters Agreement. Despite \n\n\n\f\nthat, we have come here on behalf of the people of the \nliberator, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, to speak the truth and to ask \nsome questions, firmly but respectfully, as we learned \nfrom our leader, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez Fr\u00edas, who passed away \nin March. In that regard, on behalf of my people, I \nshould like to express our gratitude for the heartfelt \ntribute paid to President Ch\u00e1vez Fr\u00edas last March (see \nA/67/PV.67).\n\nHow happy we would be to be here if we were \nreally in a place where we realized the noble ideals \nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The \nCharter talks about saving succeeding generations \nfrom the scourge of war, but the truth is that various \nmilitary interventions have been decided upon or have \nbeen allowed here that have engulfed countries and \nwhole regions of the world in long wars and instability. \nThe Security Council has been taken hostage by the \nhawks of war, and when they can, they justify their \nattacks from there; when they cannot, they simply bang \non the table and still do whatever they want, which is \nwhat they are doing when they declare that there will be \nfuture bombings in the Syrian Arab Republic.\n\nThe Charter also states that the purpose of the \nOrganization is to preserve international peace and \nsecurity. But let me ask: How do some members of the \nSecurity Council think we can achieve that purpose by \narming and protecting terrorist groups such as Jabhat \nAl-Nusra and Al-Qaida, which are obscurantist forces? \nMany of those groups are linked to horrible acts such as \nthe destruction of the Twin Towers in this very city. They \ndeny the existence of anybody who thinks differently \nfrom them \u2014 whether they be Christians, Muslims \nor Jews \u2014 and profess special hatred and rejection of \nwomen. Why are such groups supported? Why do some \nmembers of the Security Council sponsor such terrorist \ngroups, window-dressing them as political opposition \nand even allowing them to give press conferences at this \nvenue? What would representatives of Governments \nwith ongoing internal armed conflicts say if the violent \ngroups they faced were to be given space and a voice \nhere at Headquarters to justify their downfall?\n\nThe Preamble of the Charter also sets out another \nnoble goal: to promote social progress and raise the \nstandard of living in a broader concept of freedom. \nIn reality, however, poverty, hunger and injustice are \ncontinuing to grow and the standard of living and the \nstandard of freedoms are falling lower and lower. That \nis because what is imposed on us is a model of excluding \nothers \u2014 a neo-fascist model \u2014 a neo-liberal model.\n\nIn the meantime, countries such as Venezuela \nhave chosen the path to consolidate real democracy \nwith a socialist system, including the people, and that \nhas enabled us to reach the Millennium Development \nGoals. Yet we are constantly attacked and demonized \nand our political and social stability is being disrupted. \nThat is what is happening at this very moment with \nthe anti-democratic opposition in our country, which \nis being supported by media corporations in the region \nand from the whole world.\n\nParagraph 4, Article 2, of the Charter of the United \nNations emphatically states that \n\n\u201cAll members shall refrain in their international \nrelations from the threat or use of force against the \nterritorial integrity or political independence of \nany state\u201d. \nYet the President of the United States \u2014 and there is \nthe additional irritant that he is a Nobel Peace Prize \nlaureate \u2014 is threatening to bomb this or that country if \nit does not comply with his country\u2019s unilateral demands, \nwhich can even include removing a Government that \nthe United States Government does not like. Perhaps \nthat could explain why, despite the fact that the Charter \ntalks about the equality of large and small nations, the \nPresident of the United States said just a couple of days \nago that the United States was \u201cexceptional\u201d. Does that \nmean that they are not equal with the other 192 States \nMember States represented here?\nThe gap today between the noble ideals of the \nCharter and what is happening by act or omission \nhere in the Organization is truly alarming. Why does \nnobody in the General Assembly venture to propose \nthat sanctions be imposed for open violations of the \nCharter on the Government that has an illegal detention \ncentre in the military base at Guant\u00e1namo, in occupied \nCuban territory, where torture and cruel and degrading \nand inhuman treatment is being meted out to persons? \n\nWhy does nobody discuss sanctions against \nthe President who has admitted to illegal espionage \nactivities against Heads of State and Government \nrepresented here? That was a point courageously \nmade by the President of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff (see \nA/68/PV.5).\n\nWhy do we not consider the use of unpiloted \nplanes \u2014 so-called drones \u2014 which have taken the \nlives of tens of thousands of innocent victims, including \n\n\n\f\nchildren and old people, in North Africa, the Middle \nEast and parts of Asia to be crimes against humanity? \n\nWhy do we not impose sanctions against a \nGovernment that for more than 50 years has maintained \nan illegal and criminal economic blockade against the \nworthy Cuban people, and flouted decisions adopted by \noverwhelming majorities in the Assembly in favour of \nending the embargo?\n\nWhy do we not implement the resolutions adopted \nby the plenary so that the State of Palestine can be \nestablished as a peaceful, just and lasting solution to \nthe ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict? \n\nWhy does the United Kingdom not agree to start \nnegotiations with Argentina to resolve in a peaceful \nway demands over the Malvinas Islands? Might it \nperchance be because the elite of the United States and \nsome of its allies are exceptional?\n\nWe raise those questions for consideration when it \ncomes to the future of humankind, on behalf of the people \nof Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar \u2014 the people of Venezuela \u2014 who \nlove peace, equality and freedom. \n\nVenezuela has come before the General Assembly \ntoday to condemn a kidnapping. The Organization has \nbeen kidnapped. The peace and dignity of the world \nare being held hostage in New York. The kidnapper has \nmany faces. It changes names and sometimes even flags, \nbut it continues to be the same old imperalism. Eight \nyears ago, Commander Hugo Ch\u00e1vez Fr\u00edas \u2014 a tireless \ndefender of genuine peace, not the peace imposed by \nbombs, and of participatory democracy and a leader \nfor unity among peoples \u2014 called here for a genuine \ntransformation of the United Nations. Seven years ago, \nhe said that there was a whiff of sulphur here (see A/61/\nPV.12). Today, alas, I have to say once again that there is \nstill a whiff of sulphur coming from those who consider \nthemselves exceptional.\n\nThose words are truer now than ever before. The \ncourageous revelations of one young man offered a \ngreat service to humankind \u2014 let us call it a wake-up \ncall. As a result, he is now being persecuted politically \nand cannot walk freely in the streets of Manhattan. We \nhope that Edward Snowden will one day be able to walk \nfreely among a future generation of Americans who \nhave taken back their civil rights and helped to ensure \npeace in the world. That young man has shown us how \nthe privacy of every human being has been violated by \nthe most complex and sophisticated spying system that \nhumankind has ever been able to come up with.\n\nThanks to those revelations this year, we have \nwoken up to discover that George Orwell\u2019s 1984 is \nnow here. And what is the United Nations doing about \nthat? Who is setting limits on so much arbitrariness \nand running roughshod? Those are yet more questions \nthat find no answers from the General Assembly or the \nSecurity Council of the Organization, which is now \nalmost 68 years old.\n\nWe would like to suggest that the Secretary-General \nset up a body within the United Nations to ensure for \nevery inhabitant in the world the right to privacy and \nthe right to communicate without interception. Much \nhas been said here calling for peace, but that has often \nfallen on deaf ears. Let us hope that we will all learn \nhow important it is to listen to the calls of the people for \npeace, and employ that in tirelessly seeking to elevate \nhuman dignity as our guiding star.\n\nPresident John Kennedy spoke from this rostrum \n50 years ago, the last time he would do so at the United \nNations before being assassinated. How good it would \nbe if his current successor, and many people here, \nwere to re-read just some of what he said. Whatever \ndifferences we may have had with that historic figure, \nensuring peace requires that we seek out areas of \nagreement such as this:\n\n\u201cFor the value of this body\u2019s work is not \ndependent on the existence of emergencies \u2014 nor \ncan the winning of peace consist only of dramatic \nvictories. Peace is a daily, a weekly, a monthly \nprocess, gradually changing opinions, slowly \neroding old barriers, quietly building new \nstructures. And, however undramatic the pursuit of \npeace, that pursuit must go on.\u201d (A/PV.1209, p. 5)\nLet us hope that the leaders of the United States and \nthose that follow them blindly will think deeply about \nthe meaning of what Kennedy said and realize that if \nthey really want to be exceptional, they have to find \nexceptional ways of bringing about lasting peace in the \nworld.\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean we are \nshowing that with exceptional decisions and actions we \ncan build a world of peace. Unity in diversity is what \nwe have in our regional organizations: the Bolivarian \nAlliance for the Peoples of Our America, the \nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States, \n\n\n\f\nthe Union of South American Nations, the Common \nMarket of the South and Petrocaribe. All those are tools \nfor democratizing our societies that promote socially \ninclusive economic development and ensure political \nstability. Despite various internal disputes and conflicts \nbetween fraternal countries, we have been able to find \nmechanisms for the peaceful settlement of conflict. We \nhave demonstrated that without military intervention, \ndrones or economic blockades, we can build and \npreserve genuine democracy and move forward in \ncombating hunger, poverty and inequality.\n\nThe Venezuelan nation is proud of being part of a \nregion that is free of weapons of mass destruction. We \nreaffirm our commitment to encouraging the complete \nelimination of nuclear weapons and chemical and \nbacteriological weapons as a way of ensuring that life \ncan continue on planet Earth.\n\nIn his various statements before the Assembly, \nCommander Ch\u00e1vez Fr\u00edas called for improving the \nmeans for addressing problems and resolving conflicts \nin a transparent manner. He also pointed out that, in \nthe face of today\u2019s reality, there was a crucial need \nto consider whether the Headquarters of the United \nNations should be here in this country where the \nGovernment does not respect the Organization, much \nless the sovereignty of each and every State Member. \nThe United Nations should be in a place where there \nis respect for all Members; where the political will \nflourishes, without pressure or fear, to end conflict in \nthe world through dialogue; where the path forward \nis genuine social development and the elimination of \nhunger and poverty; and where what matters is how to \nstop war, not how to justify it.\n\nLet us take the United Nations to the South, where \nthe antithesis to exclusion \u2014 solidarity \u2014 has often \ntaught us that we are in fact all equal. For now, we \nwelcome the proposal of President Evo Morales Ayma \nthat we should meet in the Organization\u2019s various other \nheadquarters in different parts of the world. Beyond the \nshadows that seem to darken the future of the human \nrace, from Latin America and the Caribbean we are \nsaying and showing that another world is possible \nwhere all of us can, in peace and dignity and with \njustice, enjoy lives worth living.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, let me \nconvey the sincere condolences of the people and the \nGovernment of Liechtenstein to all those affected by \nthe abhorrent terrorist attack in Kenya. Our thoughts \nare with the victims and their families.\n\nFor the second year in a row, the Assembly is \nmeeting under the shadow of the crisis in Syria. It is the \nchallenge of our time. No other situation in the recent \npast has so dramatically tested the United Nations \nability to respond. And none has so starkly illustrated \nthe limitations and the weaknesses of our multilateral \nsystem. Thousands of people have been killed in a \nbrutal war, many of them women and children, and \nmany of them victims of war crimes and crimes against \nhumanity. Regional stability has been eroded. Millions \nof people are depending on humanitarian assistance, \nwhich is often impossible to deliver. Humanitarian \naccess to those most in need, including the sick and \nthe wounded, is being systematically denied owing \nto cynical political calculations. The humanitarian \nagencies have become a pawn in that perverted game.\n\nSadly, it took a particularly outrageous act to \ngenerate action in the Security Council: the use of \nchemical weapons, with hundreds of victims, including \ncountless children. We are encouraged to see that the \nCouncil has decided to ensure the destruction of all \nchemical weapons in Syria. That should also provide \nnew momentum to ensure that all remaining States join \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention. Indeed, it should \nbe a step towards the elimination of all weapons of \nmass destruction worldwide.\n\nThe use of chemical weapons in Syria has marked a \nwatershed in the conflict. Nevertheless, that issue must \nnot divert our attention away from the core problem: \nthe fighting in Syria continues unabated, with blatant \ndisregard for the civilian population and international \nhumanitarian law. Weapons and ammunition cross the \nborders more easily than humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe recent breakthrough on the issue of chemical \nweapons shows that political progress is possible. \n\n\n\f\nHopefully, that will create the momentum for the \nCouncil to finally live up to its responsibility: to end \nthe supply of weapons, pressure the parties to the \nconflict to accept a ceasefire, work towards a political \nsolution and prepare the ground for accountability for \npast crimes. There may be different views on who used \nchemical weapons in Syria, but everyone agrees that \nthat use constitutes a crime against humanity and a war \ncrime that must not go unpunished. It must therefore be \nput before a court of law, together with the countless \nother crimes committed, for an independent and \nimpartial investigation.\n\nSyria is our biggest collective failure with regard \nto accountability in recent history. The International \nCriminal Court (ICC) has been operational for more \nthan a decade now. During that time, we have not \nwitnessed any other situation in which crimes have \nbeen committed so systematically, on such a scale and \nfor such a long time without any adequate response \nfrom the international community.\n\nIt is well documented that crimes have been and \ncontinue to be committed by all sides. That is precisely \nthe type of crisis for which we established the ICC, and \nit is precisely the type of situation that led us to give \nthe Security Council the competence to refer situations \nto the Court. In its recent resolution 2118 (2013), the \nCouncil made a limited statement on accountability. \nMore determined and more concrete action must follow. \nA referral to the ICC will ultimately also contribute \nto a viable political future for the country, create \naccountability for those crimes, provide redress for the \nvictims and establish the truth.\n\nThe establishment of the International Criminal \nCourt has been the most significant development \nin international law for decades. Only the adoption \nof the Arms Trade Treaty earlier this year has come \neven close in terms of significance. With 122 States \nparties, the Court has attracted a strong following. But \nthe emergence of an effective international judicial \nmechanism also poses challenges. We have mandated \nthe Court to investigate and prosecute the most serious \ncrimes under international law. And we have asked it \nto focus on those perpetrators who bear the greatest \nresponsibility. Therefore, it cannot be surprising to \nanyone that the Court is dealing with individuals in \nleadership positions. We are satisfied that the Court \nfollows the evidence, and that it does not shy away \nfrom investigating and prosecuting those in powerful \npositions. It is therefore implementing its mandate and \nnot politicizing the work it does.\n\nRecent events in Syria have reminded us of the \nimportance of the amendments to the Rome Statute \nadopted in Kampala in 2010. We added provisions \nthat criminalize the use of poisonous and other gases, \nwhether they are used in international or in internal \narmed conflict. It is troubling that those provisions \nhave become relevant so quickly. But the biggest steps \nforward are amendments to crimes of aggression. They \ncomplement the prohibition of the illegal use of force \nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The \nmost serious forms of the illegal use of force by one \nState against another will become a punishable offence \nbefore the ICC. The Court will thereby help enforce \nthe core principle of the rule of law at the international \nlevel. With ratifications by Andorra, Cyprus, Slovenia \nand Uruguay earlier this week, we have come a \nsignificant step closer to our common goal, namely, \nthe activation of the Court\u2019s policy over crimes of \naggression in 2017. Liechtenstein was the first country \nto ratify the amendments, and we will continue to assist \nin the ratification process.\n\nLiechtenstein firmly believes in the responsibility \nto protect populations from crimes of atrocity. Clearly, \nwe have much work left to do in order to put that \nnorm into practice. Our inability to respond to the \ncrisis in Syria demonstrates a crucial weakness in the \nsystem: the use of the veto, or its threat, in a manner \nincompatible with the purposes of the United Nations. \nThat can make the Security Council irrelevant when it \nis most urgently needed. During this general debate, \nthe President of France suggested a common code of \nconduct for Permanent Members of the Security Council \n(see A/68/PV.5). We strongly agree with that proposal. \nAll five permanent members should be able to give the \nworld one public commitment, that is, that they will \nnot use their veto to block action aimed at ending or \npreventing crimes of atrocity. That would be crucial to \nenhancing the Council\u2019s effectiveness and credibility. \nUnfortunately, we have not yet reached the point where \nwe are able to bring the composition of the Security \nCouncil in line with the geopolitical realities of the \ntwenty-first century. But the Council is also struggling \nto adjust its working methods to new challenges in order \nto better include the perspective of non-members in its \ndecisions, which is a crucial ingredient for effective \nleadership. We will therefore continue our efforts to \n\n\n\f\npromote accountability and transparency in the work \nof the Council.\n\nThe rule of law and accountability have made \nsteady progress in the work of the United Nations. \nNevertheless, that progress remains abstract for \ncountless individuals who are vulnerable to atrocities. \nSexual violence in conflict has become a rampant \nphenomenon, with women and girls at particular risk of \nbecoming victims. The ICC has made the fight against \nthat scourge a priority. Most important, though, we \nmust do our part as States. Liechtenstein fully supports \nthe United Kingdom\u2019s initiative to take greater action \nto end sexual violence during conflict. The fight \nagainst sexual violence must also play a central role \nin the larger context of the women, peace and security \nagenda. All of that requires stronger emphasis on the \nneed to empower women. Many of our stated goals, \nfrom sustainable development to lasting peace, require \nthe full participation of women. Otherwise, they are \nsimply not attainable. In that regard, I am grateful for \nthe leadership of the Secretary-General. We should all \nrally behind his call to make the twenty-first century \nthe century for women.\n\nThe upcoming negotiations on the post-2015 agenda \nwill be a crucial test of our ability to tackle challenges \nthat will define the lives of future generations. We look \nforward to the leadership of the President of the General \nAssembly in that process. It is of course too early to \noffer a final assessment of the Millennium Development \nGoals. But we know that important unfinished business \nwill be carried over into the sustainable development \ngoals. Those new goals must be much more than just an \nextension of past efforts. They must aim at eradicating \npoverty and hunger once and for all, and finally ensure \nfull equality between men and women. They must \ntherefore be firmly rooted in human rights, respect for \nthe rule of law and principles of good governance. The \nsustainable development goals will ensure sustainability \nonly if they approach development in a holistic way. \nMost important, once we have agreed on our new goals, \nwe need to become more serious in our commitment to \nachieving them. Let us therefore develop and apply an \neffective monitoring mechanism to show the world that \nwe are indeed serious.\n\nThe post-2015 process will also be decisive in \nmoving the General Assembly back to the centre of \nmultilateral policy-making. Only the \u201cG-193\u201d provides \nthe legitimacy and universality required for decisions \nof global impact and for setting standards that apply to \nall. This is our General Assembly. Let us use it.\n"

        "file_text": "The rapidly changing \nsituation, growing tensions, radicalization, security \nchallenges and threats in various regions of the world \ntoday cannot but raise serious alarm and concerns \naround the world. In this regard, needless to say, those \nproblems enjoy special priority on the agenda of the \nGeneral Assembly at this session.\n\nThe war in Afghanistan, which has been ongoing \nfor more than 30 years, remains a serious source of \nthreats to regional and global security. The situation \nunfolding in Afghanistan, according to experts, is \ngenerally uncertain and unpredictable overall. In \nthese conditions, the drawdown of the International \nSecurity Assistance Force troops in 2014 may lead \nto an escalation of confrontation in the country, stir \nup terrorism, extremism and drug trafficking, and \naggravate the interregional standoff. Undoubtedly, it \nwill have a negative impact on the situation in the wider \nregion of Central Asia and contiguous regions.\n\nIt should be recognized that the world has adopted \nthe unambiguous view that there can be no military \nsolution to the Afghan problem. The only way out of the \nAfghan crisis is a political process through negotiations \namong the main parties involved, the achievement \nof consensus regardless of how difficult it might be, \nand active assistance provided by the international \ncommunity and the United Nations.\n\nUzbekistan adheres to an open and clear policy with \nrespect to Afghanistan on the basis of the principles \nof good-neighbourliness and non-interference in the \ncountry\u2019s internal affairs. Uzbekistan shall further \ndevelop mutually beneficial and friendly ties with \nAfghanistan on a bilateral basis, and support the \nGovernment elected by the Afghan people themselves. \nWe shall also continue to render practical assistance \nin restoring the economy of Afghanistan, taking \ninto account the fact that economic well-being is \nan indispensable condition for ensuring peace and \nprosperity in that country. These principles and \napproaches towards Afghanistan are enshrined in \nUzbekistan\u2019s foreign policy concept, which has the \nstatus of law.\n\nSecondly, today a new global development \nagenda is under consideration at the United Nations. \nIt must reflect the interconnection of human beings \nwith the environment and contribute to supporting \neconomic and social development while maintaining \necological sustainability. Uzbekistan attaches priority \nto sustainable development and ecological safety. \nWe have recently adopted an action programme on \nenvironmental protection for 2013-2017, which serves \nas confirmation of that priority. The Government of \nUzbekistan will allocate approximately $2 billion for \nimplementation of the programme aimed at further \nmaintaining decent conditions in the environment, the \nreasonable use of natural resources, and the introduction \nof the ecological basics of sustainable development in \nthe economic sectors.\n\n\n\f\nThe loss of the Aral Sea is one of the largest global \necological catastrophes in contemporary history. Each \nyear, it becomes more evident that the problem of the \ndrying up of the Aral Sea and, above all, its impact on the \nenvironmental, social and humanitarian situation, gene \npool and human health are assuming an increasingly \nbaneful and irreversible nature. We are grateful to \nthe United Nations, and to Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon in particular, for the keen attention paid to the \nproblem of the Aral Sea. That enormous support gives \nus the confidence that the countries of the region will \nnot be left alone in the struggle against that planetary \ncatastrophe.\n\nI would like to draw public attention today, first, \nto the issue of preventing the complete destruction and \nprotecting the remaining environmental system of the \nAral Sea region, ensuring minimum living conditions \nfor the people, and preserving the existing flora and \nfauna. Those key issues are the focus of the message \nof the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Chair \nof the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea, \nand created as an official document of the General \nAssembly (A/67/884, annex).\n\nSecondly, we take this opportunity to call \nupon international donors to extend assistance \nin implementing the programme of measures on \neliminating the consequences of the drying up of the Aral \nSea and averting a catastrophe in the ecological systems \nin the Aral Sea region (A/68/383, annex), which is fully \nconsonant with the Millennium Development Goals, \nparticularly, in achieving ecological sustainability, \ncombating diseases and improving motherhood and \nchildhood protections.\n\nThirdly, ensuring the reasonable use of water \nresources is an acute problem leading to a worsening \necological situation and shortage of potable water in \nour region and on a global scale. It is an open secret that \nthe Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers, the two major \ntransboundary rivers of Central Asia, have historically \nbeen a common good and a source of life for the nations \nof the region. The Aral Sea basin is supplied with water \nfrom the flow of those rivers.\n\nIn that regard, we cannot but be concerned about \nthe plans of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan to construct \nnew large hydropower stations with gigantic, \nglobal-scale dams: the Rogun hydropower station with \na 350-metre-high dam upstream in the Amu Darya \nRiver, and the Kambarata-1 hydropower station, with a \n275-metre-high dam upstream in the Syr Darya River. \nThe implementation of such plans, according to many \ncompetent specialists, would lead to the disruption of \nthe natural flow of the rivers, which is fraught with most \ndangerous ecological and socioeconomic consequences. \nThe already fragile water and ecological balance in \nCentral Asia will be radically disrupted. Moreover, the \nconstruction of these facilities is planned in areas where \nthere is a tectonic fracture with a potential seismicity \nof not less than 9-10 points on the Richter scale, which \ncarries a high risk of man-made catastrophes.\n\nTaking that into consideration, we firmly adhere \nto our principled position of the unacceptability of \nconstructing hydropower facilities on international \nwatercourses without the preliminary endorsement of \nall interested countries. It is necessary, in line with \ninternational legal practice, to conduct a mandatory, \nfair international expert examination of the Rogun \nand Kambarata-1 projects, under the auspices of the \nUnited Nations, to assess the possible impact of new \nhydropower facilities on the natural water regime, the \nenvironment, flora and fauna.\n\nUzbekistan\u2019s position is based on the norms of \ninternational law, in particular the provisions of the \nUnited Nations Convention on the Protection and Use \nof Transboundary Watercourses and International \nLakes of 1992 and the Convention on the Law of \nNon-navigational Uses of International Watercourses \nof 1997.\n\nThe year 2015 \u2014 the deadline for implementing \nthe Millennium Development Goals set in 2000 \u2014 is \napproaching. In that regard, it should be underscored \nthat the achievements of the Republic of Uzbekistan \nduring its years of independence in the economic \nsphere, social policy, addressing specific issues \nrelated to improving the well-being of the population, \nthe quality of education, health-care services and \necological sustainability have allowed our country \nto ensure priority implementation of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. I can offer figures and facts that \nreflect the current potential and development rates of \nour country.\n\nIn comparison with the year 2000, the gross \ndomestic product (GDP) of Uzbekistan grew by a \nfactor of 3.1 and the GDP per capita by a factor of \n2.6. The nominal salary grew by a factor of 22, the \naverage amount of pensions by a factor of 12.7, and \nreal income per capita by a factor of 8.4. During the \npast six years, the economic growth of Uzbekistan has \nsteadily exceeded 8 per cent. The State expenditures \n\n\n\f\nfor the social sphere and civil protection in Uzbekistan \ngrew more than fivefold. About 60 per cent of all State \nexpenditures go towards funding social development, \nincluding more than 34 per cent for education, and over \n15 per cent is spent on public health care.\n\nI am confident that Uzbekistan\u2019s continued \nparticipation in United Nations efforts in the sphere \nof sustainable development shall contribute to further \nraising the living standards of the people, achieving \nthe high goals of ensuring security and stability in the \nentire region.\n"

I also congratulate the members of his Bureau. \nI further wish to hail his predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremi., \nfor the outststanding way in which he fulfilled his term \nas President. I would also like to pay well-deserved \ntribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for all his \ninitiatives for peace and security throughout the world \nand for his personal involvement in seeking ways \nand means to bring peace and stability to the eastern \npart of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the \nentire Great Lakes region. His efforts are all the more \ncommendable given the fact that the enemies of peace \nare always on the lookout, ready to strike anyone, \nanytime and anywhere, as we have unfortunately been \nrecently reminded by the terrorist attack that brought \nsuch tragedy to the Republic of Kenya. On behalf of \nthe Congolese Government and people and on my own \n\n\n\f\nbehalf, I condemn that despicable act. We express our \ncondolences and solidarity with the brotherly people \nand leaders of Kenya.\n\nWe welcome the President\u2019s choice of theme for this \ngeneral debate, namely, \u201cThe post-2015 development \nagenda: setting the stage\u201d. He mentioned the equally \nrelevant need to draw lessons from the implementation \nof the Millennium Development Goals, consider new and \nemerging development challenges, create measurable \nindicators, establish new types of partnership and \nbetter integrate the economic, social and environmental \naspects of sustainable development. The importance of \nthe theme chosen and the relevance of the indicators \nthat accompany it are undeniable. Our thinking must \nbe even more rigorous, as we witness several troubling \nelements in the international environment.\n\nWith respect to organizing for the post-2015 \nperiod, the international community is increasingly \nwitnessing non-compliance on the part of certain \nMembers with the basic principles of international \nrelations, persistent selfishness on the part of States and \nconvulsions in the global economy. The consequences \nare manifold. They range from threats to peace to \ndeadly conflicts and from globalization driven mainly \nby the unbridled pursuit of profit to the aggravation \nof poverty. That comes in addition to the food crisis, \nfamines, diseases \u2014 including endemic diseases that \nhad once disappeared and are now reappearing \u2014 and \nenvironmental destruction, which is the main cause of \nclimate change and its deplorable effects.\n\nTo remedy the situation, the General Assembly \nhas established several bodies, and I welcome their \ncreation: the Open Working Group on Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, the Intergovernmental Committee \nof Experts on Sustainable Development Financing \nand the high-level political forum to promote the \nimplementation of recommendations and decisions on \nsustainable development. My hope is that that process \nwill be consistent with the ongoing transformation \nof the Economic and Social Council and, beyond \nthat, of the entire United Nations system, in order to \nbetter integrate the three dimensions of sustainable \ndevelopment, namely, the economic, social and \nenvironmental dimensions, in the new post-2015 \nagenda.\n\nThe new programme that we are called upon to \ncreate must be universal, ambitious and able to meet the \nhuge challenges facing humankind. It must bring about \npositive change, based on the principle of common \nbut differentiated responsibilities. In that respect, it is \nimportant to utilize the contribution of women, youth \nand civil society in both the design and the execution \nof the agenda. We should also draw lessons from the \nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals.\n\nWith regard to climate change as an important issue \nto resolve in the post-2015 period, allow me to recall \nthat, under the final document of the United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development (resolution \n66/288), States pledged to abandon unsustainable long-\nterm patterns of consumption and adopt sustainable \nways of managing natural resources as the basis for \neconomic and social development and the very future \nof humankind. Climate change is a threat to humankind \nand fundamental human rights, particularly for \nvulnerable populations and especially those from the \nAfrican continent and island countries. Seeking to limit \nits impact is, for each of our countries, a responsibility \nthat we must shoulder as a duty towards our people, a \nservice to the human race and an act of international \nsolidarity.\n\nRecognizing that fact, the Democratic Republic \nof Congo, a country of exceptional biodiversity, has \nalways sought to manage its natural resources with a \nview to the future. The management policy for of our \nforest ecosystems is aimed at that. The Grand Inga \nproject has also been designed along those lines. We \nshould emphasize, in fact, that that project should \neventually enable us to produce enough electricity to \nmeet the energy needs of nearly half of Africa. It will \nalso be clean and renewable energy, consistent with the \nrequirements of sustainable development.\n\nToday we must begin to set the stage for the post-\n2015 period. In that context, I express the hope that \nproposals will be made during this session to translate \ninto reality our common desire to promote the economic, \nsocial and environmental dimensions of sustainable \ndevelopment. Such proposals should cover our local, \nnational and regional development programmes. They \nshould also encourage bold international cooperation \nand reflect the will of each of our States to contribute \nto international peace and security.\n\nWithout peace, no progress is possible. Without \nthe minimum conditions for the safety of persons and \nproperty, all development is hypothetical. That is all the \nmore unacceptable since a breach of the peace is the \nresult of aggression. That is the sad recent history of \nmy country.\n\n\n\f\nIt is also important to remember other parallel \ntruths that are often overlooked or hidden. Because we \nacted in solidarity by welcoming Rwandan refugees to \nour territory, the Congolese population in the eastern \npart of the country has been deprived of peace \u2014 a \nfundamental right of all persons \u2014 and they continue \nto count their dead. The most recent episode of the \nunending tragedy occurred when bombs crushed the \nwomen and children of Goma last July. It was truly a \ntragedy unequalled in history and which cannot leave \nany heart untouched. It is time to ask ourselves what will \nremain of international humanitarian law if welcoming \nrefugees in distress, which is a humanitarian act par \nexcellence, becomes sufficient reason to justify the \neruption of war. \n\nThe recent bombing of Goma was all the \nmore reprehensible as it was perpetrated while the \nGovernment of the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo was in the process of implementing the Peace, \nSecurity and Cooperation Framework of Addis Ababa, \nincluding talks with the armed group responsible for \nthe bombings. Nevertheless, I wish to reaffirm my \ncountry\u2019s determination to comply with all of the \ncommitments contained in the Framework agreement. \n\nFrom that perspective, my Government has already \nundertaken the following definitive actions: the \nestablishment of the National Follow-up Mechanism to \nimplement the commitments of the Democratic Republic \nof the Congo; the acceleration of security sector \nreform, especially the army, police and justice sectors; \nfurther progress in decentralization, by adopting the \nnecessary implementation laws; the reform of public \nfinance management; and the restructuring of the \nIndependent National Election Commission. This last \nwas immediately implemented in order to prioritize the \norganization of local, municipal, provincial, senatorial \nand provincial governor elections. A national dialogue \nhas been organized, starting on 7 September, with the \ngoal of seeking national cohesion to better respond to \nall of the challenges facing the country.\n\nBeyond those efforts on the part of the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, the dawn of sustainable peace \nin the region depends on two main conditions \u2014 ending \nimpunity in all its aspects, and the diligent execution \nof their commitments by the other signatories of the \nFramework agreement. Therefore, my country again \nurgently appeals to the Organization to deal with all \nMember States with equal rigour and to require that \neach one strictly respect the principles of the Charter of \nthe United Nations. It is clear that denouncing violations \nof those principles is a good thing, but punishing those \nwho violate the principles is preferable by far, especially \nwhen those violations are ongoing and recurrent.\n\nI cannot conclude my remarks without expressing \nmy thanks to the Southern African Development \nCommunity, the International Conference on the Great \nLakes Region, the African Union and the European \nUnion for their essential role in maintaining peace in \nour region. I also thank the United Nations, in particular \nthe members of the Security Council, and all of those \nStates that have, for many years, remained at our side \nin order to ensure peace in the Democratic Republic \nof the Congo. We are all the more thankful to them, as \nthey have participated in one of the breakthroughs of \nthe post-2015 development agenda aimed at ensuring a \nbetter world for all.\n\nWe must be convinced that beyond our differences \nlies a common future. Our diversity must be seen as \nthe essential source of wealth that it is. It is high time \nthat we, the international community, find the ways \nand means to enable millions of people to not simply \nlive, but to live a life of dignity in a world where peace, \nsecurity and justice are a reality for all.\n"

        "file_text": "On behalf of \nthe Government of San Marino, I wish to congratulate \nHis Excellency Mr. John Ashe on his election as \nPresident of the of the General Assembly at its sixty-\neighth session. His long experience as Ambassador of \nAntigua and Barbuda and his in-depth knowledge of \nthe Organization are precious resources for the United \nNations. The Republic of San Marino supports the \nessential elements of his programme, mentioned in his \ninaugural address (see A/68/PV.1), and ensures its full \ncooperation in all work of the General Assembly. \n\nMy country also wishes to express special thanks to \nHis Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \nenergy, commitment and extraordinary determination \nto the benefit of the United Nations. We appreciate \nthe sensitivity demonstrated by the Secretary-General \ntowards all Member States, without distinction, and \nhis constant presence in all international politically \nrelevant and emergency situations. His visit this year \nto our Republic on the occasion of the Investiture \nCeremony of Their Excellencies the Captains Regent \nmarked a significant moment in the history and public \nlife of our small State, and was an honour for the San \nMarino people.\n\nThe theme chosen this year\u2019s session \u2014 \u201cThe post-\n2015 development agenda: setting the stage\u201d \u2014 places \nat the heart of our debate the need to pursue the \nMillennium Development Goals and to comply with \nthe obligations undertaken. It also serves to reaffirm \nthat it is only through the determined commitment of \nthe Organization that those Goals can be effectively \nachieved.\n\nWe believe that significant progress has been made \nin achieving many of the Goals, such as the eradication \nof extreme poverty, access to drinkable water, \ncombatting HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, and \nthe improvement of the health conditions of women \nand children. However, we are well aware that the full \nachievement of those objectives is still far off. Despite \nthe progress made, we are deeply concerned for regions \nin the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa, that require \nurgent and effective action, as well as for those countries \nexperiencing conflicts and post-conflict situations \nwhere the population lives in extreme conditions.\n\nSan Marino, like many other countries, believes that \nin setting the fundamental objectives of the post-2015 \nagenda, due account must be taken of the challenges \nthat in the course of the past years \u2014 that is, since the \nadoption of the Millennium Declaration \u2014 have become \nmore urgent. Among the challenges, peace and security, \nthe elimination of inequalities and environmental \nsustainability are, in our view, top priorities, not only \namong States but also within States, owing to their \nmagnitude and urgent nature.\n\nPeace is the indispensable condition for building \nand fully implementing a development model centred \non the human individual. Therefore, dialogue and \nnegotiation, as tools to resolve conflicts, should be \npursued with greater effort and determination by the \nentire international community, which considers this \nsearch to be a fundamental mission of the Organization.\n\nSimilarly, when crimes against humanity are \ncommitted \u2014 crimes that the Secretary-General has \nrecently denounced and documented, after a strong \ncondemnation \u2014 united action to eliminate chemical \nand nuclear weapons is needed in order to avoid \nresponding to violence with violence. Too many violent \nconflicts have recently defined the internal life of some \nStates and the relations among them. There are far too \nmany dead, in particular civilians, to talk of satisfactory \nconditions of peace. But peace can be founded only \non respect for human rights, social justice and the \nemancipation of the weakest segments of society.\n\nThe Republic of San Marino reasserts its own \ncommitment to the goal of a world free of any form \nof racism and racial discrimination, where the freedom \nof expression and association, and above all the \nfreedom of religion, are guaranteed and the personal \nfulfilment of individuals is ensured. To that end, we \nshall be guided by the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights. Furthermore, San Marino praises the high-level \nmeetings marking the first part of the session of the \nGeneral Assembly, because the themes discussed are \nnot only urgent but also extremely important.\n\nThe Republic of San Marino has always paid special \nattention to the most vulnerable groups, such as women, \nchildren, the elderly and the disabled. Today, women are \n\n\n\f\nstill the victims of discrimination and violence in many \nparts of the world, including in the most developed \ncountries. In the poorest regions of our planet, maternal \nmortality remains a challenge. Moreover, women are the \nmost vulnerable to HIV infection. Trafficking in women \nis far from being resolved. Women are often subject \nto abuse and to humiliating and degrading treatment, \nincluding polygamy, child marriage, kidnapping and \nsexual violence, including domestic violence. Women \nliving in conflict and post-conflict situations are often \nsubject to sexual violence, mass rape, torture, summary \nexecutions.\n\nThe advancement of women\u2019s rights and the \nelimination of all barriers to their full participation in \npolitical, economic and social life must be top priorities \nfor the United Nations, along with the promotion of their \neconomic opportunities and equality in all sectors.\n\nThe United Nations has the duty to protect children, \nthe most vulnerable victims of violence, abuse and \nexploitation. In the most poverty-stricken areas of the \nworld, the infant mortality rate is still unacceptable \nand a very high number of children suffer from chronic \nmalnutrition, which is the main cause of child mortality. \nMy country hopes for the universal ratification of the \nConvention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional \nProtocols and their full implementation.\n\nThe international community must strive for the full \ninclusion and participation of people with disabilities in \nthe economic, social and cultural life of the community. \nDespite the significant steps forward taken over the \nlast years in terms of equality and non-discrimination \nagainst disabled persons, much remains to be done for \nthe implementation of the Convention on the Rights \nof Persons with Disabilities, through the adoption of \nlegislative measures and national and international \npolicies. The Republic of San Marino welcomes the \nconvening of the High-level Meeting on the Realization \nof the Millennium Development Goals and Other \nInternationally Agreed Development Goals for Persons \nwith Disabilities (see A/68/PV.3) and fully supports its \noutcome document (resolution 68/3).\n\nIn particular, it must be stressed that the protection \nof disabled persons can be more easily achieved if the \nsocial and economic policies of individual States and \ninternational organizations pay due attention to the \ninstitution of the family as the natural environment \nin which human beings are born and develop their \nawareness of the rights and duties regulating coexistence \namong people.\n\nMy country\u2019s priorities include environmental \nsustainability and the prevention of and response to \nnatural disasters. Over the last years, certain regions \nof the world have been shaken by unprecedented \nnatural disasters. In Asia, Latin America and Africa, \nin particular in the Horn of Africa, local communities \nhave suffered from extreme conditions, experiencing \nthe tragic consequences of their vulnerability and of \nfood and health uncertainty.\n\nOur thanks go to the Secretary-General, the Office \nfor the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the \nCentral Emergency Response Fund for their prompt and \ncrucial intervention in favour of populations affected \nby natural disasters. However, individual Member \nStates must do more and give rapid and effective \nsupport to populations in emergency situations, both by \ninvesting in the most vulnerable regions so as to build \nthe capacities necessary for preventive action and by \nproviding them with the moral and financial support \nnecessary to cope with disasters.\n\nThe Republic of San Marino attaches great \nimportance to the issue of preventing and responding to \nnatural disasters. Despite its small size, it ranks fifty-\nfirst on the list of donors to the Central Emergency \nResponse Fund.\n\nLastly, the finalization of the post-2015 development \nagenda cannot be separated from a discussion on the \nstrengthening of global governance mechanisms, since \nthe achievement of the new development goals will be \nthe result of cooperation among all Member States. \nSan Marino believes that the United Nations has the \nduty to retain its leadership role in global governance \nmanagement.\n\nMy country is a traditional sponsor of the annual \ndraft resolution entitled \u201cThe United Nations in global \ngovernance\u201d, to be submitted in 2013 for the third time. \nIt reiterates the need for a more inclusive, transparent \nand effective approach to solving the world\u2019s problems \nand recognizes the central role to be played by the \nUnited Nations in global governance.\n\nIndeed, the highly democratic nature and the \nuniversal character of the United Nations grant it \nindisputable legitimacy and a patrimony deriving from \nthe cultural diversities and the traditions it represents. \nThis leads to an approach focusing on humankind and \nthe promotion of human rights in which the needs of the \nentire international community are taken into account. \nIndeed, global problems require global solutions.\n\n\n\f\nAgainst that background, our Organization must \nadapt. The political role and authority of the General \nAssembly, and reform of the Security Council, are the \ncore issues of such a reform process. The demands \nmade today by the peoples of North Africa and the \nMiddle East require a review of working methods \nand the decision-making process in order to ensure \nthat solutions are reached in the context of which the \ninterests and positions of all parties concerned are duly \ntaken into account.\n\nThe Republic of San Marino has always believed \nin the power of dialogue, democracy and respect for \nothers. That is why, in its centuries-old history, it has \nnever fought any war. Drawing on that experience, \nwe believe that \u2014 and this is our contribution to the \ngeneral debate \u2014 the Millennium Development Goals \nand the definition of the post-2015 development agenda \nneed to be set within this perspective.\n"

        "file_text": "I will \nbegin with a simple question: what is the key challenge \nfacing today\u2019s world? I believe that it is the fact that \nhumankind\u2019s societal evolution has not kept pace with \nglobalization. We are constantly lagging behind. Our \nfailure to adjust quickly and effectively has given rise \nto a range of political, economic and social problems. \nThat mismatch between technological and societal \ndevelopment has been the norm since the beginning of \nthe industrial revolution, in the late eighteenth century. \nFurthermore, these days it represents a far more serious \nthreat than ever before. The pace of globalization has \nbeen steadily accelerating, and therefore we have had \nto adapt much more quickly.\n\nWe need a mechanism that will enable us swiftly \nand effectively to address this problem. Such a \nmechanism could appropriately be called \u201ca new global \nworld order\u201d.\n\nToday we can hardly say that we have a global order \nat all, as the notion of order implies stability, which \nwe do not have at present. The old rules are not being \nobserved, and new ones have not been established. \nWe permanently find ourselves stricken by various \nglobal crises. The great Powers seek to provide global \ngovernance by means of clubs whose membership \nis limited to themselves. Other countries wager on \nregionalism, and medium-sized and small countries see \ntheir rights infringed at every turn. \n\nOverall, the current geopolitical situation is \ncharacterized by an increasing dynamic of multilevel \ncompetition as well as by the global governance crisis. \nWhat is even more alarming is that all of this is taking \nplace against a backdrop of increasing global inequality. \nIt is clear that if we cannot arrive at an order by design, \nanarchy will come to us by default.\n\nLet me state that Belarus has no clear-cut recipe as \nto how to build a new global order. After all, this can \nhardly be done quickly and simultaneously. The great \nGoethe once said: \n\n\u201cMan is not born to solve the problem of the universe, \nbut to find out what he has to do and to restrain \nhimself within the limits of his comprehension\u201d.\nLet us try to proceed with precisely this logic in \nmind. We are convinced of the need to move forward \nfirst and foremost in areas where there is a particular \nurgency to do so.\n\nWe believe that we should start by strengthening \nthe role of the State in today\u2019s world. The industrial \nrevolution once made the State strong and the idea \nthereof appealing.\n\nIndeed, the history of the past two centuries has \nnot been a narrative of military power. Rather, it has \nbeen a story of the growing force of the principle of \nself-determination, that is, the aspiration of nations to \nestablish their own States, which can then effectively \npromote the interests of their citizens. It is no wonder \nthat in times of crisis and uncertainty, the great leaders \nof the past saw the strengthening of the State\u2019s role as \na solution. United States President Franklin Roosevelt, \nfaced with the Great Depression, thought that only \na strong State could address the problems of the \n\u201cforgotten man\u201d.\n\nOver the past several decades, globalization, \nespecially in its unregulated phase, has clearly reduced \nthe role and importance of the State. We find ourselves \nin a paradoxical situation. On the one hand, global \nprocesses have curtailed State power. On the other \nhand, tackling the growing transnational challenges \nsparked by globalization requires strong States. What \ndo we mean by this?\n\nLet us start from the premise that we all live in \na very diverse world. States, reflecting this range of \ndiversity, assume very different forms in their domestic \nand internal organization. History has shown that it is \nimpossible to boil all States down to the same level.\n\nWe are convinced that it makes sense to assess \nStates, and let me here resort to philosophy, on their \ncontent rather than their form. In other words, a strong \nState is an accountable State, in both domestic and \nforeign policy, regardless of its form.\n\n\n\f\nLet us then build relations based on the notion \nof content rather than form. Indeed, why does the \ndomestic political situation of, say, Belarus or Cuba \nserve as a basis for some countries to pursue policies of \nsanctions and persecution \u2014 policies that contravene \ninternational law \u2014 against those States? After all, \nit was the people of those countries who determined \ntheir form and they do not wish another, because their \nGovernments pursue accountable policies. By and \nlarge, the people have no objections to them in terms \nof content.\n\nThe call for a strong State, of course, has nothing in \ncommon with a call for dictatorship. Franklin Roosevelt \nsaid: \n\n\u201cHistory proves that dictatorships do not grow out \nof strong and successful Governments, but out of \nweak and helpless ones\u201d.\nState weakness is no longer a humanitarian \nconcern but a problem of international security. It is a \nguarantee that we will fail to cope with the mismatch \ngenerated at the global level by the different paces of \nthe globalization and societal adaptation processes.\n\nWe deem the next area of focus to be efforts to \nensure global convergence. It is worth pointing out \nthat such attempts have often been undertaken in the \npast. Unfortunately, the areas of application were \ninappropriate from the start. Convergence basically \noccurred in the context of attempts by the mighty of \nthe world to impose their own political and economic \nmodels on other countries. That was outright coercion. \nAs a result, all such attempts have backfired.\n\n\nIn today\u2019s world, completely different approaches \nare needed \u2014 approaches aimed at unity and stability \nrather than disunity and anarchy. We need social \nconvergence. To put it simply, we must work to create \na robust middle class in every State, without coercion. \nAfter all, all countries have an interest in a sizeable \nnational middle class. History has clearly shown that \nsuccess in that area will ensure the domestic stability \nof a State and foster its interest in pursuing a foreign \npolicy of international stability. We are convinced that \nthe benefits produced by the middle class at the national \nlevel can have a similar impact at the international level. \nA large number of middle-income countries worldwide \nwould be the best safeguard to ensure a truly multipolar, \nfair and stable world. Such a group of States would \nseek neither diktat nor dominance over others. What \nis more, having just recently emerged from the grip of \npoverty and domestic instability, many countries have \nfully realized the importance of global development \nand of solidarity aimed at the least developed countries.\n\nBuilding on that understanding, Belarus is keen \nto rekindle the topic of middle-income countries at \nthe international level. In May, we held a regional \nconference on middle-income countries in the context \nof sustainable development. We witnessed immense \ninterest in that event. Likewise, Belarus welcomes the \nhigh-level international conference on middle-income \ncountries held in June in Costa Rica. Those and other \nrelevant events point to the need for more focused \nwork within the United Nations system on cooperation \nwith middle-income countries. At the same time, a \nnumber of ongoing trends are working to prevent the \nstrengthening of the middle class in those States. The \nunfettered globalization ardently carried out by the so-\ncalled market fundamentalists has served to increase \ninequality in the world and hollow out the middle class. \nMany, in both developed and developing countries, \nare already confronting the resulting political and \neconomic consequences.\n\nWe pin our hopes for improvement on the ongoing \neffort at the United Nations to design a post-2015 \nUnited Nations development agenda. The world is \nfast approaching the 2015 completion deadline set for \nthe Millennium Development Goals. My country\u2019s \ncurrent view is that the key lesson to be drawn, even \nat this stage, is that there can be no lasting progress \nin today\u2019s world in any individual area if other areas \nare neglected. That is because everyone and every thing \nin the world \u2014 people, economies and threats \u2014 has \nbecome highly interconnected. For instance, one cannot \nsucceed in tackling migration without addressing \npoverty, conflicts and environmental disasters. That \nperception, in turn, points to the need to set the stage \nfor a comprehensive post-2015 development agenda. \nIt is highly commendable that the United Nations, \nits Member States and many other stakeholders have \nalready been actively engaged in the preparatory \nprocess. Likewise, it is gratifying that everyone views \nthe paradigm of sustainable development as the basis \nfor the future agenda. That is the proper course, as \nsustainable development \u2014 based on its economic, \nsocial and environmental components \u2014 is the best \napproach to meeting the global development challenges \nin a truly comprehensive manner.\n\n\n\f\nBelarus shares the view that the sustainable \ndevelopment goals should be at the heart of the next \nagenda. We see the need to develop such goals in as \nmany areas as possible. It is particularly crucial that \nthey address those areas not covered by the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, such as, for example, migration, \nenergy and employment. We believe that each and every \ngoal must be achieved through appropriate thematic \nglobal partnerships among States, international \norganizations, civil society and the private sector. A \ngood example of that is the global partnership against \nslavery and trafficking in persons initiative, which is \nnow being successfully implemented. We hope that a \ncomprehensive approach to development will help in \ncontrolling globalization and, more important, ensure \nthat it is fair. After all, it must work in the interests of \nall rather than of a few. Drawing on a historical analogy, \none can argue that the post-2015 development agenda \nrepresents our future, comprehensive \u201cnew deal\u201d \u2014 like \nthe one launched by Franklin D. Roosevelt. The United \nNations serves as the indispensable platform \u2014 thanks \nto its unquestionable legitimacy, universal membership \nand comprehensive scope \u2014 for the international \ncommunity to appropriately reconcile and subsequently \nimplement its interests in terms of the new deal.\n\nThe greatest danger in geostrategic uncertainty is \nnot the uncertainty itself; rather, it is the desire to take \naction in a complex setting using yesterday\u2019s logic, \nnamely, a business-as-usual attitude. We are certain \nthat only by shaking off such an approach will we be \nable to forge a global order to benefit all people on \nEarth.\n"

        "file_text": "It was \nin my country, in Ypres, during the First World War, \nthat chemical weapons were used in a conflict for the \nfirst time. We can all recall the dreadful suffering of \nthousands of those soldiers. Almost 100 years later, \nthat same suffering is being inflicted on thousands of \nSyrians. Despite the international Geneva Protocol of \n1925, the history of the world \u2014 a shared history \u2014 is \nrepeated, from Ypres to Damascus.\n\nThis is the second year that I have addressed the \nGeneral Assembly from this rostrum. In one year, so \nmany hopes have been raised and fulfilled but, at the \nsame time, so many additional war crimes have been \ncommitted. A year ago, I spoke of 30,000 Syrian \ndeaths. Today there are 120,000. And that conflict is \nnot the only one. While we are talking here, atrocities \ncontinue in various parts of the world.\n\nAll of us here must show as much courage as the \nmen and women who are fighting in the streets for their \nfreedom and dignity. Within the United Nations, we \nhave everything we need to act, while those who are \nfighting often have nothing but their courage to live on. \nIf a veto must be cast, it should be a veto on tyrants and \ntheir crimes.\n\nNo one can end a famine or stop a tyrant alone.\nPeace is a shared responsibility. That is why there is \nno alternative to multilateralism and politics, if we \nseek to improve the lot of humankind. That is what \nmotivates Belgium\u2019s commitment, which is political, \nfinancial and at times even military, as the fifteenth \nmost significant contributor to the United Nations.\n\nMy country is also of the view that among \nour responsibilities we have the responsibility to \nprotect \u2014 that is to say, the responsibility to prevent and \nfight the particularly atrocious crimes of genocide, war \ncrimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. \nBelgium fully supports the actions of the United \nNations in that regard. In 2014, we will organize an \ninternational conference in Brussels on the prevention \nof genocide.\n\nWhen we work together, we achieve results. Mali is \nproof of that. But let us not forget that nothing is ever \n\nsettled forever. For it to last, peace must be continuously \nnourished. I would like to commend in particular the \nrecent efforts of the international community in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. The population \nof the north-east of the country has for years suffered \nmassacres, mass rapes, the forced recruitment of \nsoldiers, including of child soldiers, pillage and forced \ndisplacement. Just yesterday, witnesses told me of \nmartyred children. That is shameful.\n\nThe efforts of the Secretary-General and the \nSecurity Council to strengthen the mandate of the \nUnited Nations Organization Stabilization Mission \nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo are bearing \nfruit. The Intervention Brigade is playing an active \nrole in protecting the population. The Addis Ababa \nFramework offers a genuine possibility for the \nstabilization of the entire region. However, let us make \nno mistake: agreement at Kampala is essential for the \nprocess to be successful. Pragmatic solutions must \nalso be found \u2014 without, however, accepting general \namnesty or allowing for impunity for war crimes and \ncrimes against humanity.\n\nBelgium stands ready to contribute to such solutions. \nThe territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic \nof the Congo must also be respected. All external \ninterference must cease. Belgium urges the Congolese \nauthorities to implement the structural reforms needed \nin the army and the police, so as to re-establish the \nrule of law throughout the national territory and to \nguarantee the prosperity of the Congolese people.\n\nGoing to war, building walls and curtailing rights \nis always easier than building bridges and keeping \nthe peace. It is easier to build walls than to organize \na democratic system or build hospitals and schools. \nIn our contemporary globalized world, conflicts can \nbe resolved only by political solutions. That is why \nBelgium supports the efforts of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, \nJoint Special Representative of the United Nations \nand the League of Arab States, as he seeks to bring \nthe parties to the negotiating table. In that regard, I \nwelcome the American-Russian initiative to hold the \n\u201cGeneva II\u201d conference.\n\nIt is not death that metes out justice; it is respect \nfor the law. It is the law that organizes human societies, \nprotects the weak and prevents violence. Law is \nessential because a world without rules \u2014 whether in \nterms of civil interactions, trade or finance \u2014 leaves \nhumankind face to face with its worst enemy: itself. \nRespect for the law is a foundation of the life we share. \nLaws must be respected, including in situations of \nconflict. I am referring in particular to humanitarian \nlaw, so that victims can receive assistance and care.\n\nBelgium has echoed and tirelessly backed the calls \nfrom humanitarian agencies for the obstacles to their \nactivities to be lifted. We demand that access to health \ncare be improved on the ground everywhere, including \nin Syria. All parties must respect international \nhumanitarian law. My country participates actively \nin efforts to provide assistance to populations that \nhave been victims of fighting. The onset of winter \nand the sharp rise in the number of victims, refugees \nand displaced persons mean that the international \ncommunity must step up its efforts further still.\n\nThe law must also stop impunity. Peace cannot ever \nbe built on amnesty for the worst crimes, or turning a \nblind eye thereto. Together with 56 other States, Belgium \nhas called for the situation in Syria to be referred to the \nInternational Criminal Court. The work of the Court is \ncontributing to bringing about an era of responsibility. \nAll States should cooperate with the Court.\n\nThe law must also make it possible to bring \ndictatorships and oppression to an end. In 2010, all \nthose who defend democracy welcomed the advent of \nthe Arab Spring. I am not one of those who today have \nturned their backs on that hope. Let us not forgot all \nof the women and men in Tunisia, Libya, Egypt and \nelsewhere who wish to live in peace. We must support \nthem and promote the holding of free elections. We \nshould encourage them to draft constitutions that \nguarantee fundamental rights, justice and equality. We \nshould also recall that winning an election or exercising \nauthority following elections does not give someone \nthe right to oppress minorities. True democracy means \nrespecting and protecting minorities.\n\nThe law must guarantee individual freedoms. \nFreedom means, for example, the right of young women \nto study and to choose their partners for themselves \nor to remain single. Freedom also means the rights \nof women to move in public as they please. Freedom \nalso means to right to practice one\u2019s religion or to \npractice none at all. Freedom also means the right of \nheterosexual and homosexual couples to walk hand in \nhand in the street or in other public spaces. I am proud \nthat Belgium guarantees those fundamental freedoms. \nI am also proud that my country promotes efforts to \nspread such freedoms everywhere in the world.\n\n\n\f\nWhile I am speaking of continuing our efforts \nand making them lasting, I would like to mention the \nresumption of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. It is \nabsolutely vital that we seize the opportunity afforded \nby our American friends. A solution must be arrived at \nnow, based on the coexistence of two States, with the \nState of Israel and an independent State of Palestine \nliving side by side in peace and security. We have also \nmade it very clear that we are against colonization. \nIn that context, Belgium is ready to host a conference \nin Brussels aimed at ensuring that private economic \npartners provide support for the peace process. We \nbelieve that there can be no economic plan, however, \nunless there is a political plan with a concrete timetable.\n\nPeace and security also depend on harmonious \nprosperity, whose benefits must be shared equitably \naround the globe and among its citizens. According to \nscientists, the world\u2019s ecological footprint now exceeds \nthe world\u2019s capacity for regeneration by about 50 per \ncent. That situation is untenable and affects everything \non the planet. \n\nI welcome the United Nations initiative to convene \nHeads of State and Government here in New York for \na forum on sustainable development. It is here that \nless developed and developed countries can solve the \nhuge challenge of sustainable development together. \nEvery country has problems that are either shared or \ncomplementary and interconnected. By that I mean \nextreme poverty, desertification, the exodus for \necological reasons of millions of people, the exhaustion \nof natural resources and climatic warming.\n\nDespite the progress that has been made, \nmuch remains to be done to meet the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. Hunger, poverty and unequal \naccess to education and health care are intolerable \ninjustices. We must continue to mobilize to fight them. \nThat is why Belgium asks that the efforts made under \nthe rubric of post-2015 development be merged with the \ngoals of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment in a single negotiation framework within \nthe United Nations. That single framework should \nbring together the economic, social and environmental \naspects that are becoming facts of life for all of us.\n\nI would like to touch on one final subject, that is, \nespionage and cybercrime. Our colleague President \nDilma Rousseff asked a true question for today (see \nA/68/PV.5). Is it permissible to ignore privacy laws in \nthe name of security and the fight against terrorism, \ntwo areas that are basic for all peoples? I support \nthe call by the President of Brazil for protecting the \nprivate lives of citizens everywhere, in particular \non the Internet. She proposed the establishment of a \nmultilateral framework designed to effectively ensure \nthe protection of data online. The Internet must not \nbecome an invisible battleground. It should remain an \ninstrument of freedom and development for all, a place \nwhere all can communicate in peace and security.\n\nIn 2014, along with other nations, Belgium will \nsolemnly commemorate the centenary of the First \nWorld War. We will do it out of duty to the memory \nof the young men from more than 50 countries who \ncame to die on the battlefields of my country in order \nto liberate us. They were not even 20 years old. We will \nalso commemorate the war\u2019s centenary in order to teach \nyoung people of today, so that they too can become \nmilitants for peace.\n"

        "file_text": "I congratulate you, \nMr. President, on your election to the presidency of the \nGeneral Assembly. I also wish also to thank you for your \ncontinued strong support for small island developing \nStates (SIDS) issues, which you have championed for \nmany years and have once again demonstrated, this \nweek, in the process and lead-up to the United Nations \nThird International Conference on Small Island \nDeveloping States, to be held in the Pacific next year.\n\nFrom economic woes to outright poverty, from \nsocial instability to acts of violence and ethnic or \nreligious conflict, and from the devastation of natural \ndisasters to deadly acts of terrorism, no country is \nspared or completely shielded. The events in Kenya, \nIraq, Pakistan and here in the United States over the past \nweek demonstrate the multiple risks we face in today\u2019s \nworld. Our sympathies go to the Governments and \npeople of those countries, and our deepest condolences \nto the people who lost family and friends in those tragic \nevents.\n\nWhile the Organization continues to grapple with \nvarious serious problems that require collective, United \nNations-led action for their resolution, perhaps the \ngreatest threat we face today is climate change. Climate \nchange is a security risk of far greater proportions than \n\n\n\f\nmany people are prepared to admit. For some low-lying \nPacific island countries, climate change may well lead \nto their eventual extinction as sovereign States. \n\nThe singular importance and urgency of climate \nchange to our region was given added prominence today \nwhen Pacific Forum leaders met with Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon. Our Chair, the President of the Republic \nof the Marshall Islands, presented to the Secretary-\nGeneral the Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership, \nwhich is an effort by our region \u2014 the most likely to be \nfirst and worst affected by climate change \u2014 to launch \na new wave of more determined leadership across the \nglobe, aimed at accelerating the reduction and phasing \ndown of the world\u2019s greenhouse-gas pollution before it \nis too late.\n\n\nThe root causes of climate change and the means for \naddressing them are widely known. We in the Pacific \nknow already from bitter and harsh experience, as will \nmany other parts of the world, what the consequences \nof climate change are, and they will only become more \nsevere if not enough is done. \n\nSadly, what is evident to us in the climate change \nnegotiations is the continued triumph of vested interests \nin preventing and delaying the action that should be \ntaken. In a diverse world of different capacities and \ncapabilities, those least able to mitigate and adapt to \nthe impacts of climate change look to Member States \nin leadership roles to rise to the challenge and lead by \nexample, to ensure that the post-2020 climate change \nconvention currently being negotiated will effectively \naddress the mounting fears of countries like mine of \nthe catastrophic effects of climate change if it is not \ntackled collectively and with determination. As world \nleaders, we have the responsibility for fashioning a new \nagreement that will reassure low-lying islands that we \nhave their interests and priorities at heart. Let us rise to \nthe occasion and be part of the solution.\n\nIn June, during the historic event of the signing of \nthe Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), Samoa announced that \nit would sign the Treaty at the highest political level \nduring the Treaty event at the General Assembly\u2019s \ncurrent session. We kept that promise, and I signed \nfor Samoa in a special ceremony two days ago. We \nwelcome the fact that more than 100 nations, including \nthe United States, have now signed the Treaty. \n\nFor small island countries like Samoa, it takes \nonly a few small arms and light weapons in the wrong \nhands to cause instability. Indeed, within our own \nPacific region, such so-called small arms have fuelled \nconflicts, disrupted the lives of communities and \nimpeded countries\u2019 development. The Arms Trade \nTreaty, when fully implemented, will greatly help small \nisland States like mine in their efforts to sustain our \ncommunities\u2019 security and stability. Our signing of the \nATT is also further testimony to our firm commitment \nto general and complete disarmament, since it will \ncontribute significantly to saving lives, stopping human \nrights abuses and avoiding crises, and is an important \nstep in reducing and eventually eliminating altogether \nthe human cost of conventional arms.\n\nSamoa remains fully committed to the peacekeeping \nwork of the United Nations, one of the Organization\u2019s \nmost effective and successful mandates. For more than \n10 years, Samoa has been contributing civilian police \nofficers to peacekeeping operations in countries such \nas South Sudan, Timor-Leste, Liberia, the Sudan and, \nin the Pacific, the Regional Assistance Mission to \nthe Solomon Islands. We will be in a better position \nto increase our contribution to peacekeeping missions \nafter a United Nations selection, assistance and \nassessment team has completed its evaluation, which is \nplanned to take place before the end of 2013, of eligible \nofficers from our police force.\n\nSamoa looks forward to next week\u2019s High-level \nDialogue on International Migration and Development. \nInternational migration poses both challenges and \nopportunities for countries of origin, transit and \ndestination. Its contribution to sustainable development \nwill therefore ultimately depend upon the willingness \nof source and destination countries to work out \nimaginative and humane arrangements that benefit \nboth those countries and migrants. Samoa is working \nclosely with New Zealand and Australia, through \ntheir seasonal-worker schemes, to ensure that those \nimportant initiatives result in mutual benefit for both \nthe sending and receiving parties in the arrangements.\n\nYesterday\u2019s High-level Meeting on Nuclear \nDisarmament (A/68/PV.11) highlighted yet again the \nurgent need for a treaty banning nuclear weapons, \ngiven the catastrophic humanitarian consequences \nof any use of such weapons. Such weapons represent \nthe great paradox of our time. While nations desire \npeace and talk of peace, far more of the national wealth \ngoes towards the development and acquisition of ever \nmore sophisticated and destructive weapons of mass \ndestruction. Our Pacific region was the scene of a great \n\n\n\f\ndeal of nuclear testing, with some islands still bearing \nthe scars of those tests. Our regional response was the \nSouth Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, the Rarotonga \nTreaty, to ensure that nuclear testing in the Pacific \nwould be a thing of the past.\n\nSamoa reaffirms its continued support for a \nnuclear-test-free world. Early agreement must be \nreached to ban nuclear testing and to cease the creation \nand manufacture of more nuclear weapons.\n\nWe place great faith in the rule of law and the vital \nprotection it offers to all States, especially to weak \nand small countries such as mine, with no armed force \nand not affiliated with any military grouping. The \nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) is an important \npart of the architecture of world peace based on the \nrule of law, and we are pleased to have been the second \nState party to ratify the two Kampala amendments to \nthe Rome Statute last year. With the deposit yesterday \nof the ninth instrument of ratification, we hope that \nthe Kampala amendments will come into force soon \nand that the ICC will become the first court since the \ninternational military tribunals in Nuremburg and \nTokyo to hold individuals responsible for crimes of \naggression.\n\nThe United Nations needs to adapt to the changing \ncontemporary international environment or risk being \nbypassed in favour of institutions and groupings that \nare more responsive to the needs of Member States. The \nHigh-level Political Forum is one such welcome reform, \nand Samoa is very pleased to have participated in its \ninaugural meeting this week.\n\nStill more fundamental reform is required to address \nthe existing imbalances in the current power structure \nof the Security Council through the enlargement of \nboth categories of membership and improvements to \nits working methods, so as to reflect the realities of \nthe present time and to enhance the Council\u2019s role and \neffectiveness.\n\nThe renewed efforts made and great courage \nshown in the process of restarting the stalled Middle \nEast peace plan for the Israeli and Palestinian peoples \nhas our strongest endorsement. It gives rise to hope \nthat the two-State solution, which is the only option \nwith realistic prospects for lasting peace, can still be \nachieved.\n\nThe number of areas of tension and trouble \nspots around the globe is increasing, and they are \ngetting deadlier. The availability of weapons of mass \ndestruction and, now, their use in Syria is unnerving. \nThe untold suffering brought about by the Syrian \ncrisis has touched many hearts, and the latest episode, \nwhere we watched in utter disbelief the use of chemical \nweapons to kill indiscriminately defenceless victims \nand even children, is incomprehensible.\n\nWe therefore welcome the joint proposal by the \nUnited States and Russia and the willingness of \nSyria to have its chemical weapons destroyed under \nthe competent United Nations authority. We expect \ntotal compliance, which is required for this initiative \nto succeed. As long as weapons of mass destruction \nsuch as chemical weapons continue to exist, some \nmegalomaniac will sooner or later resort to their use, \nwith deadly consequences for the world. The ultimate \nsafeguard is, of course, the destruction of all such \nweapons, whether chemical, biological or nuclear.\n\nThe United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment called for the convening in 2014 of a Third \nInternational Conference on Small Island Developing \nStates, to remind the international community that small \nisland developing States (SIDS) face unique challenges \nand vulnerabilities requiring dedicated support and to \nhelp build their resilience.\n\nSamoa is honoured to host that Conference in \nSeptember 2014, on behalf of the Pacific small island \ndeveloping countries. The Barbados interregional \nmeeting endorsed \u201cThe sustainable development of \nsmall island developing States through genuine and \ndurable partnerships\u201d as the overarching theme of the \nConference. A renewed global partnership will help \nSIDS to manage a multitude of risks, so that they can \npursue inclusive economic growth, social development \nand environmental sustainability.\n\nSamoa has also proposed to utilize the Conference \nas a platform to launch specific, concrete SIDS \npartnerships as the most effective means to implement \nsome of the group\u2019s challenges and as a legacy of the \nConference.\n\nIn advancing the SIDS development agenda, \nthe Samoa Conference strategically provides a \nwindow for SIDS as a group to agree on their \npriorities and to consolidate their positions ahead of \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon\u2019s leaders\u2019 summit on \nclimate change in 2014, the post-2015 United Nations \ndevelopment agenda now under discussion, and the \nnegotiations for a successor climate-change treaty post-\n2020, which are in progress.\n\n\n\f\nLet me conclude by conveying our gratitude to \nall our partners \u2014 developed and developing, big \nand small, Governments and non-governmental \norganizations, civil society and the private sector \u2014 for \ntheir dedicated support, which has helped my country \nto reach a new threshold in its journey as a State \nMember of the United Nations. Our new status as a \nnon-least developed country beyond January 2014 can \nbe sustained only with the support of Samoa\u2019s truly \ngenuine and durable partners.\n"

        "file_text": "It is with a heavy heart that \nI address the Assembly today. Just before I left Ghana \nto attend this general debate, I learned of the terrorist \nattack that took place in Nairobi. I was shocked and \ndeeply saddened to hear of the many lives that were lost \nto those senseless and cowardly acts of violence. As the \ndeath toll increased, so too did my grief, knowing that \neach additional number symbolized one more human \nlife. Those numbers symbolized individuals who \nmay have been strangers to those of us here but were \nof prime significance in the lives of the people who \nloved them \u2014 their parents, children, husbands, wives, \nfriends and colleagues.\n\nSoon enough, I got word that one of the people \nmassacred was a person of significance in my life \nand in the lives of so many other Ghanaians. Kofi \nAwoonor was a 78-year-old gentleman who had served \nhis country loyally as a poet and professor, ambassador \nto Brazil and Cuba, and Chairman of our Council of \nState, a presidential advisory body. Professor Awoonor \nhad once even been our country\u2019s envoy to the United \nNations. On this fateful day, however, Professor \nAwoonor was in Nairobi to perform his poetry at a \nwriters\u2019 conference. He had travelled there with his \nson, and they had decided before the day\u2019s scheduled \nevents to do what should have been one of the most \nordinary and uneventful of activities \u2014 to make a stop \nat a shopping mall.\n\nUnfortunately, what happened that day at the \nWestgate Premier Shopping Mall was anything but \nordinary. Professor Awoonor\u2019s life was taken from \nhim and those who loved him, just as the lives of \ndozens of others were taken away from them and their \ncommunities. Each of them had a unique story and \naccomplishments or aspirations for which they will \nbe remembered. Professor Awoonor\u2019s son, though \ninjured, was among the many who were lucky enough \nto escape the attack. It is a day they will never forget. \nThey will carry the scars, physical and emotional, with \nthem. We who watched from a distance should never \nallow ourselves to forget, because we have also been \nirrevocably marked by this tragedy.\n\nWhen independence was upon us and our \npossibilities felt endless, the world saw how brightly \nAfrica could shine. Then, for decades, that light was \ndimmed. There was a time when killing seemed almost \n\n\n\f\ncommonplace in Africa. Indeed, there are plenty of \ngraves that remain unmarked. There was a time when \nthe ruthlessness of dictators seemed to be the order of the \nday. For decades, the corruption, greed and depravity of \na few caused the suffering of an entire continent. We so \neasily could have succumbed to the wars, the poverty \nand the diseases, but we did not. We staggered our way \nthrough, year after year, and eventually we made it. We \nhave survived. \n\nLast year when I addressed the General Assembly \n(see A/67/PV.9), I began with the assurance that I had \ncome with good news from Ghana, with stories of \nsuccess from the African continent. This year, it gives \nme great pleasure to do the same \u2014 even on the heels \nof the dastardly terrorist attack \u2014 because I know \nthat today\u2019s Africa will not be divided or deterred by \nthe heinous crimes of those who wish to disrupt our \nprogress. I know that our borders will no longer be \nused to undermine the brotherhood and sisterhood of \nour citizens. \n\nThe days of massacres must remain in our past. \nOur rivers will no longer run red. Our children must be \nstudents now; we will no longer allow their childhoods \nto be stolen from them by those who wish to turn them \ninto soldiers. Africa is standing tall, walking confidently \ntowards political stability, walking confidently towards \neconomic prosperity, walking proudly towards ethnic \nand religious harmony and coexistence. There is no \nplace in today\u2019s Africa for hatred and intolerance and \nthe murder of innocent people \u2014 not anymore, not ever \nagain. So we will mourn our dead. We will console \nourselves and each other through our grief. We cannot \nallow terror to defeat us. That must strengthen our \nresolve. Our stride will not be broken.\n\nLast year from this stage, I also declared Ghana\u2019s \nresolve to be a beacon of peace and democracy in the \nWest African subregion. On behalf of the citizens whom \nI serve, I promised the world that Ghana would not \nallow its territory to be used in any manner whatsoever \nto destabilize other nations. Ghana has been steadfast \nin its cooperation with its regional neighbours to \nmaintain the security of those nations that are enjoying \nstability and to restore security to those, such as \nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Mali, that have recently emerged \nfrom turmoil. Currently, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is in a stage of \nrebuilding. The recent overtures towards reconciliation \nmade by President Ouattara are a major step towards \nbridging the country\u2019s political divide. After its own \nbout with terror, Mali made a solid return to democracy \nby conducting an election that all observers, even the \nsceptics and the cynics, hailed as being free, fair and \npeaceful.\n\nWest Africa has seen enough war and strife. We \nwant peace and security to persist in our subregion. \nGhana will continue to play its role in strengthening the \nEconomic Community of West African States to make \nsure that it is able to meet that objective.\n\nWith all that I have said in my statement today, I \nam sure it will not come as a surprise to anyone that \nGhana enthusiastically threw its support behind the \nArms Trade Treaty adopted by the General Assembly \nat the sixty-seventh session. International trade in \nconventional arms and ammunition must be regulated. \nWe like to mention how the world has become a global \nvillage, especially when speaking of technology, culture \nand travel. The ease of communication in that global \nvillage also exists for warmongers and terrorist groups, \nwho are using it to recruit new members, expand their \ncells, create intercontinental networks, obtain weapons \nand conceal their identities and locations. If we are to \nfight back, we must also work cooperatively. Nations in \nthe developed world must align themselves with nations \nin the developing world. We must form partnerships \nand work together. Ghana is prepared to do that. We \nhave signed the Arms Trade Treaty and we intend to do \neverything possible to see that it is ratified in a timely \nmanner.\n\nFledgling democracies tend to be fragile. Their \nlimits are still being tested; their characteristics are \nstill being defined. Democracy is not a one-size-fits-all \nventure, nor is it a one-time event. It is a system that \ntakes decades to build, a process that pushes a country \ntowards a perfection it will never reach, but countries \nmust try nonetheless. This past year, the limits of \nGhana\u2019s democracy were tested, and I am proud to \nreport that we passed with flying colours. \n\nThe results of our recent elections were contested. \nSince our return to constitutional rule, Ghana has \nconducted six successful elections. Last year\u2019s elections \nwere the first whose results were formally challenged \nand heard by the Supreme Court. What made that \nsituation noteworthy was the reliance of all parties \ninvolved on the rule of law. The proceedings were \ntelevised for the sake of transparency. The verdicts were \nreadily accepted, and there was not a single reported \nincident of violence.\n\n\n\f\nGhana\u2019s victory is not an aberration. Other \ncountries, like Kenya, have had similar experiences. \nThat indicates that democratic institutions in Africa are \ngrowing stronger. It indicates that the balance of power \nin African countries is shifting from the authority of a \nsole individual to the more equitable process of properly \ndesigned systems. Strong institutions are the hallmark \nof every nation\u2019s stability. They are crucial tools in the \nfight for human rights.\n\nIt is our intention to bring an end to youth \nunemployment. In Ghana today, we are about to launch \nthe Youth Jobs and Enterprise Development Fund, \na programme that will provide young people with \nentrepreneurial skills and access to the funds needed \nto establish businesses of their own or expand existing \nones, thereby creating new employment opportunities \nfor themselves. \n\nSix of the ten fastest growing economies in the \nworld today are on the African continent. However, \nthat growth has not yet been translated into sustainable \nemployment opportunities. Over the course of the past \ndecade, African economies created over 37 million \nwage-paying jobs, yet 63 per cent of workers remain \ntrapped in low-paying subsistence or self-employment \nendeavours. With those realities come the very real \npossibilities of income instability, exclusion from \nthe benefits of economic growth and social security \nbenefits tied to formal sector employment.\n\nAfrica has a fast-growing population, more than \n50 per cent of which is below the age of 35. That means \nwe must create more jobs for our growing numbers of \nyouth. They must have opportunities available to them. \nWe cannot do that unless we transform the economies \nof Africa. It all comes down to value. We must value \nour resources, including our human resource \u2014 we \nmust value our people. \n\nWe cannot continue to be exporters of raw materials \nand primary produce. We need to add value to our \nexports. We cannot continue to export raw cocoa beans \nin Ghana; what we need to do instead is process more \nof those beans into value-added products. We cannot \ncontinue to export unrefined gold; we need to add value \nto our gold exports. We cannot continue to export oil \nand gas; we need to integrate that industry into our \neconomy; we need to process petroleum products and \nproduce power with the gas. We cannot continue to \nexport bauxite and then in return import alumina to \nfeed our local aluminium smelter; we need to work \ntowards creating an integrated bauxite and aluminium \nindustry in Ghana.\n\nIn that way, by keeping the concept of value at the \nforefront of our economy, we can create new jobs for \nour young people. We can do that with local and foreign \ninvestors who share our vision. Often the rest of the \nworld wrongly assumes that we in Africa do not know \nour worth. But we do. It is not sympathy we want; it is \npartnership \u2014 and the ability to stand on our own feet. \nIt is not handouts we are in search of; it is opportunities. \nWe have already shown that with time and the right \nopportunity, Africa can make it.\n\nGhana achieved the Millennium Development Goal \n(MDG) targets for reducing poverty and hunger far \nahead of the scheduled date of 2015. We are on track for \nachieving MDGs 2, 3, and 6 as well. School enrolment, \ngender parity and the reduction of HIV/AIDS have \nall seen dramatic progress and statistical shifts as a \nresult of the work to reach our targets. While we are \nlagging behind in MDGs 4, 5, and 7 \u2014 infant mortality, \nmaternal health and environmental sustainability \u2014 the \nfigures show that there has been a vast improvement. \nSince 2000, the number of maternal deaths for every \n100,000 births has decreased by more than half, from \n740 to 320. We recognize that when we are talking \nabout human lives, even a 50 per cent decrease is too \nlittle; it is not enough. That is why in 2010 we launched \nthe MDG Accelerated Framework and Country Action \nPlan.\n\nWomen account for more than 50 per cent of \nGhana\u2019s population. We believe that empowering them \nthrough education and encouraging them to take full \ncontrol of their reproductive rights will help us not only \nto attain the MDGs faster, but also to build a better \nnation. It is not enough to put girls in school and allow \nthem just enough education to be deemed literate; we \nmust keep them in school. Removing teenaged girls \nfrom school for any reason, let alone to marry them off, \nis an unacceptable practice that must end. \n\nAfrican women have always been the backbone \nof our societies. Let us imagine the change they could \neffect in our countries if we would only help them to \nreach their full potential. As a President and a father, I \nowe it to my children \u2014 my sons and my daughter \u2014 and \nall the children of Ghana to create a country where \nthey may walk with their dignity intact and heads held \nhigh, standing shoulder to shoulder with the children of \nEurope, South America, Asia, North America and the \nrest of the world.\n\n\n\f\nGhana is encouraged by the new initiative to resolve \nthe Israeli-Palestinian issue. We are still firm in our \nbelief that an independent Palestinian State, existing \nside by side with a peaceful and secure Israeli State, \nis a desirable outcome that we must all support and \nwork towards. In working towards that goal, we must \nrealize that the continuous construction of settlements \nin Palestinian territory increasingly shuts the door on a \ntwo-State solution.\n\nGhana calls once again for the embargo against \nCuba to be lifted. It is a relic of the Cold War era and \nhas no place in our current global dispensation.\n\nWe have come a long way since the end of the last \nglobal war, yet the makeup of the Security Council \ndoes not reflect those developments. Ghana therefore \nsupports the reform of the Security Council.\n\nGhana will continue to pursue the principle of \nconstructive engagement in our relations with the \nother countries in the world. We are fully committed \nto promoting honest global partnership that is informed \nby mutual respect and reciprocity.\n\nIn closing, I would like once again to pay my \nrespects to those who have lost their lives in Kenya, \nSyria, Palestine, Egypt, Libya, Pakistan, Iraq, Nigeria, \nMali, Somalia, Turkey, India, the United States and all \nthe other places where terrorists have attacked just this \nyear alone. The reason we are all gathered here today is \nto find the ways and the means to create a better, more \npeaceful and prosperous world.\n"

The resolution could lead to \nthe elimination of chemical weapons and the exclusion \nof their use in Syria and pave the way for a political \nsolution of the Syrian crisis, putting an end to the \nsuffering of the Syrian people.\n\nIt is our strong belief that there is no alternative \nto the peaceful solution of conflicts. The resolution \nof conflicts requires political will and determination. \nThree months ago, on 18 June the Presidents of the \nthree co-Chair countries of the Minsk Group of the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \n\n\n\f\n(OSCE) \u2014 Russia, United States and France \u2014 made a \nnew statement on Nagorno Karabakh in the framework \nof the Group of Eight Summit in Enniskillen. \n\nIn Armenia, we welcomed that statement and \naffirmed that, like the co-Chairs, we continued to \nbelieve that the elements outlined in the statements of \nthe Heads of State of the co-Chair countries over the \npast five years can form the basis for reaching a fair and \nlasting settlement of the conflict. We share the position \nof the co-Chair countries that those elements should \nbe seen as an integrated whole and that any attempt \nto select some elements over others would make it \nimpossible to achieve a solution. We absolutely agree \nthat peoples should be prepared for peace, not war. \nUnfortunately, to date the Azerbaijani leadership has \nbeen doing just the opposite, increasing warmongering \nand anti-Armenian hate speech on a daily basis, even \nusing the lofty rostrum of the United Nations for its \npurposes.\n\nWe absolutely agree with the Heads of the three \nco-Chair countries \u2014 which are also three permanent \nmembers of the Security Council \u2014 that the use of force \nwill not resolve the conflict and that only a negotiated \nsettlement can lead to peace and stability. However, \nthrough its unprecedented accumulation of offensive \nweaponry at a massive scale, Azerbaijan seriously \nendangers regional and international security, despite \nits membership in the Security Council.\n\nUnlike Azerbaijan, Armenia has on several \noccasions reiterated its commitment to the principles \nof international law and, in response to the Enniskillen \nappeal of the Presidents of the United States, the Russian \nFederation and France, once again reaffirmed that \ncommitment, particularly with respect to the non-use \nof force or the threat of force, equal rights and the self-\ndetermination of peoples and territorial integrity.\n\nAzerbaijan keeps misinterpreting the 1993 \nresolutions of the Security Council \u2014 resolutions 822 \n(1993), 853 (1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993) \u2014 the \ncore requirement of which was the immediate cessation \nof all hostilities and hostile acts and the establishment \nof a durable ceasefire. Azerbaijan has not only failed \nto comply with the latter requirement, but further \nintensified its aggression and the military operations \nagainst Nagorno Karabakh and Armenia using \nmercenaries closely linked to notorious terrorist \norganizations. It is not surprising that since the \nceasefire agreement was signed in 1994, the mediators, \nthe three permanent members of the Security Council, \nhave never made another reference to those resolutions.\n\nAzerbaijan is acting as if the international \ncommunity shared its approach and as if it shared \nthe approach of the international community. In \nreality, Azerbaijan continuously rejects all proposals \nof the internationally mandated OSCE Minsk Group \nco-Chair countries. Baku has rejected all versions of \nthe Basic Principles of the settlement of the Nagorno \nKarabakh conflict proposed by the co-Chairs of the \nOSCE Minsk Group, including those presented at \nthe Kazan, Sochi, Astrakhan and Saint Petersburg \nsummits. Baku refuses not only the Basic Principles, \nbut also the confidence-building measures proposed \nby the co-Chairs on consolidation of the ceasefire, \nwithdrawal of the snipers from the line of contact and \nthe establishment of a mechanism for investigating \nceasefire violations. Azerbaijan not only obstructs \nconfidence-building measures, but also periodically \norganizes provocations on the line of contact with \nNagorno Karabakh and on the border with Armenia, \nwhich has resulted in new casualties.\n\nAt the previous session of the General Assembly \n(see A/67/PV.19), I spoke about the Azerbaijani \nleadership\u2019s release and glorification of an axe-murderer \nnamed Ramil Safarov, which was strongly condemned \nby the entire international community and by the \nhuman rights commissions of the United Nations and \nother international organizations. Even today, more \nthan a year after Safarov\u2019s release, the Azerbaijani \nleadership continues to declare that what they did is \njust and right and dares to criticize the stance of the \ninternational community. That clearly demonstrates the \ndeepening gap between the Azerbaijani leadership and \nthe international community in terms of perceptions of \nwhat is good and what is bad.\n\nMost recently, Azerbaijani authorities at the \nnational level have ostracized the eminent Azerbaijani \nwriter Akram Aylisli for publishing a novel in which he \ntalks about the pogroms against Armenians in Baku, \nSumgait and other parts of Azerbaijan. Aylisli\u2019s books \nwere publicly burned, and the writer had to leave the \ncountry after receiving death threats.\n\nJust last week the Azerbaijani leadership once \nagain came up with new threats against Armenia and \nNagorno Karabakh and made claims to Armenian \nterritories, including its nearly 3,000-year-old capital \ncity, Yerevan. Notwithstanding Azerbaijan\u2019s destructive \n\n\n\f\nstance, Armenia will continue to make efforts towards \nthe settlement of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict \nexclusively through peaceful means and on the basis \nof the purposes and principles and norms set forth in \nthe United Nations Charter and the provisions of the \nstatements made by the Presidents of the three co-Chair \ncountries\u2019 at L\u2019Aquila, Muskoka, Deauville, Los Cabos \nand Enniskillen.\n\nIn March, the Human Rights Council adopted \nby consensus a resolution initiated by Armenia and \nco-sponsored by over 60 countries on the prevention \nof genocide. The recognition, condemnation and \nprevention of genocide remain a priority for Armenia, \nand we will take the necessary actions to prevent new \noccurrences of the crime of genocide, while keeping the \nissue of responsibility for crimes against humanity and \nthe denial thereof high on its agenda. As the nation that \nsurvived the first genocide of the twentieth century, \nArmenia unequivocally welcomes the clear position \nadopted by the States Members of the United Nations \nthat precludes any possibility of immunity or pardon \nfor perpetrators of crimes against humanity.\n\nIn May 2013, Armenia assumed the chairmanship \nof the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, \na regional organization that is a key partner of the \nUnited Nations in our shared global quest to advance \nthe principles of fundamental freedoms, the defence \nand promotion of human rights and the continuous \nefforts for peace and security.\n\nCooperation between the two organizations is also \nwell established in the fight against racism, xenophobia, \nhate speech and intolerance. Those issues are also \namong the priorities established during Armenia\u2019s \nchairmanship, elaborated in response to the challenges \nthat Member States of both the United Nations and the \nCouncil of Europe are facing today.\n\nArmenia is committed to strengthening the \ninstitutional capacities of the United Nations. In that \nregard, we support the United Nations reform process \nand are ready to contribute to it. We believe that the \nreforms provide an opportunity to enhance the role of \nthe Organization in addressing the crucial issues facing \nthe world.\n"

        "file_text": "First, I would like to \ncongratulate you, Sir, on assuming the presidency of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session.\n\nI would now like to make a new pledge about \nthe situation in Syria. The use of chemical weapons \nhas caused profound shock and anger on the part \nof the people of Japan, including myself. Chemical \nweapons must never be used again. I hereby declare \nthat Japan will provide thorough support to, and the \ngreatest possible cooperation with, the international \ncommunity\u2019s efforts to dispose of Syria\u2019s chemical \nweapons. We feel righteous indignation about innocent \ncivilians continuing to be victims. Japan regards the \ncessation of violence, the initiation of political dialogue \nand the improvement of the appalling humanitarian \nconditions as issues of the utmost urgency. \n\nAt this very moment, the number of refugees \nis soaring. To them, Japan will provide still greater \nassistance. We will act in cooperation with the \ninternational community to extend a helping hand \nto internally displaced persons and refugees fleeing \nacross national borders. I take pride in the fact that \nJapan\u2019s non-governmental organizations and volunteer \norganizations are working around the clock to help \nthem.\n\nJapan will also continue to provide assistance to \nareas under the control of the opposition groups, where \nit is difficult for assistance from the international \ncommunity to reach. We are working to undertake the \ntraining of staff working at medical centres. We will \nalso deliver portable X-ray devices and other medical \nequipment to those areas.\n\nWith the escalating despair of refugees now as \nthey head for a harsh winter, I would like to announce \nthat the Government of Japan will provide and make \nimmediately available approximately $60 million in \nadditional humanitarian assistance to Syria and its \nsurrounding countries. We are determined to conduct \nsuch assistance in parallel with the process of political \ndialogue, notably the \u201cGeneva II\u201d conference, and to \nmove forward in cooperation with the international \ncommunity.\n\nOur nation, Japan, and its capital, Tokyo, have \nbeen granted the honour of hosting the 2020 Olympic \nand Paralympic Games, seven years from now. To \nreciprocate that good fortune we have come to enjoy, my \nobligation first of all is to rebuild the Japanese economy \nto be vibrant, and then to make Japan a dependable \nforce that works for good in the world. I pledge here \nthat I will make Japan a force for peace and stability \nin the world, just as it has been until now \u2014 or, rather, \nmake it an even greater such force than it has been thus \nfar, given the increasingly tragic state of the globe.\n\nJapan will newly bear the flag of proactive \ncontributor to peace, anchored in the undeniable record \nof and the solid appreciation for our country, which has \nendeavoured to bring peace and prosperity to the world \nwhile emphasizing cooperation with the international \ncommunity.\n\nThe balance of power in the world has been \nchanging rapidly, and technological innovations are \nnow removing all borders from both new opportunities \nand new types of threats. It is now impossible for any \none country, no matter which one it may be, to safeguard \nits own peace and security acting entirely by itself. \nThat is why Japan is working to garner trust from the \nworld as a creator of added value and a net contributor \nto regional and global peace and stability. Under those \ncircumstances, the role of the United Nations will \nbecome even more important than it is today. \n\nJapan has continually promoted the concept of \nhuman security, and the implications of the concept will \nsurely expand. Through the accumulated discussions \nover the nine years since the submission of a report \nby the Commission on Human Security, the resolution \non a common understanding on the notion of human \nsecurity was adopted, here at the General Assembly, \nin September 2012 (resolution 66/290). Guided by the \nwisdom of its forerunners, Japan is determined to \nfurther spread the concept and build actual practices.\n\n\n\f\nI will enable Japan, as a proactive contributor to \npeace, to be even more actively engaged in United \nNations collective security measures, including \npeacekeeping operations. I believe that Japan must \ncontinually cultivate our human resources so that they \nare appropriate for use in United Nations activities.\n\nFor Japan, whose national interests are firmly \nconnected to the stability of open seas, changes to the \nmaritime order through the use of force or coercion \ncannot be condoned under any circumstances. Japan \nhas great expectations that public spaces, ranging \nfrom outer space and cyberspace to the skies and the \nseas, will be rigorously preserved as global commons \ngoverned by rules and laws.\n\nJapan, as a country that understands the horror and \ndevastation wrought by atomic bombs, will utterly devote \nitself to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and \nthe total elimination of nuclear weapons. North Korea\u2019s \nnuclear and missile development cannot be condoned. \nJapan also maintains serious concerns with respect to \nother weapons of mass destruction that North Korea is \nlikely to possess. Pyongyang should listen to the unified \nvoice of the international community and rectify its \nown actions by taking a tangible step. We demand that \nNorth Korea return every Japanese national whom it \nhas abducted, without exception. While in office, I \nam determined to resolve that issue completely. The \nnormalization of diplomatic relations with North Korea \nremains unthinkable without the resolution of that \nissue.\n\nAs for the nuclear issue of Iran, Japan hopes that \nthe country\u2019s new Administration will move forward \nwith concrete actions. We are ready to continue to play \na role in resolving the issue.\n\nIn the Middle East region, a cornerstone for world \npeace and prosperity, Japan will continue its unique \ncontributions towards the Middle East peace process.\n\nJapan will also continue to extend cooperation to \nthe countries of Africa, which are certain to become a \ngrowth engine in the twenty-first century. Firmly rooted \nin our own experiences, that cooperation takes the \nfostering of human resources as its main emphasis and \nseeks to achieve sustainable growth while cultivating \nownership by Africa itself. In June, my Government \ninvited African Heads of State and Government and \nrepresentatives of international organizations to \nJapan, where it convened the fifth Tokyo International \nConference on African Development (TICAD V). On \nthat occasion, I was deeply struck by the eagerness \nexpressed by representatives of African nations for \nprivate sector investment. \n\nInvestment flow to Africa now exceeds the flow \nof assistance. I also heard from the African leaders \ntime and again that assistance should be utilized \nstrategically as a catalyst for attracting investment. \nThat is the evolution that discussions in the 20-year-\nlong TICAD process have witnessed and given rise to. \nTICAD V became a forum where we celebrated the \npath that Africa has walked down, and together we \nreconfirmed that Japan has been an enduring partner \nweaving dreams side by side with Africa.\n\nI hold the firm conviction that the future course \nof Japan\u2019s diplomacy will begin here, by sparing \nno pains \u2014 and with our regained strength and \ncapacity \u2014 to become actively engaged in meeting the \nhistoric challenges that today\u2019s world faces. I consider \n\u201csparing no pains\u201d to be nothing less than the basso \ncontinuo notes that set the basic tone for Japan\u2019s actions, \nbe they in diplomacy or any other field.\n\nAs a country with such intentions, strengths and \nachievements, Japan considers it extremely regrettable \nthat the structure of the Security Council is still frozen \nin a state that reflects the realities of some 70 years ago. \nSecurity Council reform must proceed without delay. \nJapan\u2019s aspirations to becoming a permanent member \nof the Council have not changed in the slightest.\n\nEverything begins with Japan refortifying its true \nabilities and its economy. The growth of Japan will \nbenefit the world. Japan\u2019s decline would be a loss for \npeople everywhere. How, then, does Japan aim to \nrealize its growth? Mobilizing the power of women will \nserve as both a source and outcome of growth, a point \nalmost self-evident at this gathering.\n\nThere is a theory called \u201cwomenomics\u201d, which \nasserts that the more the advancement of women \nin society is promoted, the more growth increases. \nCreating an environment in which women find it \ncomfortable to work and enhancing opportunities for \nwomen to work and to be active in society is no longer \na matter of choice for Japan. It is instead a matter of the \ngreatest urgency.\n\nHaving declared my intention to create a society \nin which women shine, I have been working to change \nJapan\u2019s domestic structures. However, that is not \nconfined merely to domestic matters. I would now \n\n\n\f\nlike to discuss how it is also an issue guiding Japan\u2019s \ndiplomacy. To begin with, I would like to state four \ncontributions through which Japan aspires to remain a \nleading member within the international community. \n\nFirst, Japan respects the activities of UN-Women \nand intends to become one of its leading contributors, \nand therefore an exemplary country in that area. Japan \nwill also work closely with the relevant international \norganizations.\n\nSecondly, as other like-minded countries have \nalready done, Japan also intends to develop a national \naction plan with regard to women, peace and security, \nin cooperation with people working at the grass-roots \nlevel. \n\nThirdly, Japan will cooperate closely with not \nonly UN-Women, but also the International Criminal \nCourt and the Office of the Special Representative of \nthe Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, \nMs. Zainab Hawa Bangura. It is an outrage that there \ncontinues to be sexual violence against women during \ntimes of armed conflict even now, in the twenty-first \ncentury. Japan will do everything possible to prevent \nsuch crimes against women and to support \u2014 both \nmaterially and psychologically \u2014 those people who \nunfortunately become victims of such acts.\n\nFourthly, Japan will submit once more at the next \nsession of the Commission on the Status of Women \na draft resolution that gives careful consideration to \nwomen in natural disasters, as they are likely to be \nvulnerable. Japan, which experienced a major natural \ndisaster two years ago, wishes to garner support for \nthe draft resolution, which embodies our outpouring of \nsupport for the matter.\n\nI would now like to make use of the examples \nof three individuals to clarify Japan\u2019s development \nconcept aimed at bringing about a society in which \nwomen shine, and also to shed light on some issues that \nmust be tackled. I will first introduce the examples of \na Japanese woman and a Bangladeshi woman, and then \nthat of an Afghan woman, as the third example.\n\nMs. Tokiko Sato was an expert at the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, responsible for \nimproving maternal, newborn and child health for \nover 15 years in a remote village in Jordan. Undaunted \nby the suspicious looks she initially received from \nthe villagers, Ms. Sato would speak with anyone, \nanywhere. Devoted to her ideas, including making \nuse of public entertainment to persuade the villagers, \nMs. Sato finally found herself accepted by the village \ncommunity. Ms. Sato\u2019s tenacity gradually transformed \nthe traditional idea that the one who decides the number \nof children is the husband, not the wife, into a mindset \nthat values the health of women.\n\nAs the Assembly is aware, my country played \na leading role in the establishment of the the Global \nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Japan \nintends to continue to make an appropriate contribution \nat the upcoming Fourth Replenishment, which seeks to \nsecure additional financing for the Fund. However, as \nfor the post-2015 development agenda, it would be most \nappropriate to broaden the focus to encompass those \ndiseases individually. \n\nJapan regards approaches that address individuals \nholistically as better able to meet their broader health \nneeds. That is why Japan decided to promote universal \nhealth coverage \u2014 \u201cUHC \u2014 on the occasion of TICAD \nV. To address health issues in the African region, \nwe have readied $500 million and are at present \nconcentrating on setting up training for 120,000 health \nand medical services providers. With regard to medical \ncare for all, there can be no doubt that the people who \ngive the human touch to the three letters in \u201cUHC\u201d are, \nin concrete terms, people like Ms. Sato, who without \nhesitation go into local communities. \n\nThe second person I would like to introduce is \nMs. Nilufa Yeasmin, a young Bangladeshi woman and \nthe mother of two. Her professional title is \u201cPoly-Glu \nLady\u201d. Poly-Glu is a made-in-Japan water purifier \nderived from a food that can be found in Japan in great \nabundance. One simply adds it to turbid water. Poly-Glu \nacts as an adsorbent, adhering to excess substances in \nthe water, and then falls to the bottom as a precipitate, \nleaving the water clear. It is necessary to teach people \nhow to use it correctly at the outset, and Ms. Yeasmin \nand other Poly-Glu ladies serve as both salespersons \nand instructors.\n\nAs members can see, as with what is called a \u201cbase of \nthe pyramid\u201d business, that endeavour is characterized \nby the expectations placed on the power of women. By \ncombining her income with her husband\u2019s, Ms. Yeasmin \nhas been able to send her children to an institution of \nhigher education. Poverty caused her to give up on the \ndream she had cherished as a little girl of becoming a \ndoctor someday. But I understand that now she proudly \nstates she has become a doctor of clean water. Can we \n\n\n\f\nnot say that Ms. Yeasmin has acquired self-esteem, the \nmost precious asset of all? My Government wishes to \ncreate as many Ms. Nilufa Yeasmins as possible. \n\nBy the way, the company that makes Poly-Glu is a \nvery small Japanese company. We will work to enhance \nthe assistance to such companies and organizations to \nallow their ideas to bear fruit.\n\nFinally, there is one more woman I would like to \nintroduce to everyone in the Hall today, but this Afghan \nlady is no longer with us. Her name is Ms. Islam Bibi, \nand on 4 July she was gunned down and assassinated. \nShe was 37 years old and is survived by three children. \nMs. Islam Bibi was a proud female police officer \nwith the Afghan police. She came to shoulder heavy \nresponsibilities through her nine years of service. She \nguarded polling stations to monitor elections and was a \ntrainer to young female officers coming after her. We \nhave much work to be done. However, we must proceed \nundaunted.\n\nUnder the auspices of the Law and Order Trust Fund \nfor Afghanistan, Japan has been one of the countries that \nhave always taken great pains to improve the capacity \nof the Afghan police force and cultivate female police \nofficers, whose number will finally reach 1,800 \u2014 still \nfar from enough. I have renewed my determination to \ncontinue to provide support in order to prevent another \ncase like that of Islam Bibi.\n\nI wanted to emphasize \u2014 through the real-life \nexample of Ms. Nilufa Yeasmin in Bangladesh \u2014 the \nnecessity of promoting women\u2019s participation in society \nand their empowerment. My Government has prioritized \nthat as its foremost policy and will continue to undertake \nhighly inventive efforts, including launching start-up \nbusinesses in Africa.\n\nThrough her actions, Ms. Tokiko Sato, the \nJapanese aid specialist, has highlighted the importance \nof maternal, newborn and child health, an MDG \nwhose attainment has been conspicuously slow. My \nAdministration will, as its second priority policy area, \nengage greater efforts towards women\u2019s health and \nmedical care.\n\nFinally, what I hoped to convey through the tragic \nexample of Islam Bibi is the importance of women\u2019s \nparticipation and their protection in the context \nof peace and security. Japan intends to promote \nmeasures to ensure women\u2019s participation at all \nstages \u2014 including in conflict prevention and resolution \nand in peacebuilding \u2014 and to safeguard their rights \nand the physical well-being of women who are exposed \nto danger in times of conflict.\n\nI would like to state here that in establishing those \nthree pillars, the Government of Japan will direct \nofficial development assistance in excess of $3 billion \nover the next three years, to target the pillars.\n\nIn conclusion, if we were to follow the wisdom \nof the so-called \u201cwomenomics\u201d theory, as mentioned \nearlier, the development concept aimed at cultivating \nthe power of women would generate greater peace and \nwell-being in the world. I wish to bring about a society \nwhere women shine, within Japan and in conflict \nregions and countries suffering from poverty. In that \ncontext, I do not consider the outlook to be optimistic. \nHowever, I know one thing: in Japan a considerable \nnumber of people are working unsparingly towards that \nend. They are the people who are making every effort to \nready themselves to be able to work together, in unity.\n"

        "file_text": "Thirteen years ago, the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) established \nhumanitarian principles for the twenty-first century. \nTogether, Member States and international organizations \nstood for the idea that the world\u2019s poorest nations and \npoorest people should not have to live without dignity \nand hope.\n\nThe world is a different place now. We have \nwitnessed the struggles of a global economy reeling \nfrom a financial crisis and, indeed, a recession. But \nwe have seen a billion people lifted out of poverty, \nmore children in schools, greater care for the sick. And \nwe have observed a generation born in a new age of \ninformation, ready to embrace ever-expanding frontiers \nof technology.\n\nBut the transformative effect is not yet complete. \nThe list of shortcomings is as long as that of the \nsuccesses, and as we think about the theme of \u201cThe \npost-2015 development agenda: setting the stage\u201d, we \nmust have the courage to go beyond business as usual. \nThe report of the High-level Panel on the Post-2015 \nDevelopment Agenda, A New Global Partnership: \nEradicate Poverty and Transform Economies through \nSustainable Development, has laid out an ambitious \nvision for the future, and I congratulate the eminent \npersons who worked to produce it.\n\nBut together we must now take an honest look \nat the MDGs, determine what worked and what did \nnot, and commit to forging a new global partnership \nfounded on mutual responsibility and trust. That will \nrequire developing nations to take greater ownership \nof the post-2015 agenda. One of the failings of aid has \nbeen the lack of attention to country-specific context \nin agreements. So now is the time for the developing \nworld to make its voice heard in order to shape the \ndebate and ensure that policies and programmes are \ndemand-driven. \n\nIt will also require Governments to empower those \nwhose lives we are trying to transform, to give them a \n\n\n\f\nstake in the process and a say in their countries\u2019 progress. \nIn Rwanda, we have found that empowering local \nleaders while demanding accountability is an effective \ncatalyst of development. But for decentralization to \nwork, the centre must remain stable. That is why we \ncontinue to place such emphasis on good governance. \nIt has inspired trust in our institutions and been a \nfoundation for our development. We know it is the best \nway to achieve inclusive and sustainable development.\n\nThere must also be a far greater focus on the role of \nthe private sector and recognition of its power to create \nprosperity. For that, we need a global environment \nwithout trade barriers and one that facilitates \ninvestment in infrastructure. Greater investment is \nparticularly needed in roads, railways and airports \nin order to connect domestic markets to regional and \nglobal ones. Investment is also needed in energy. \nElectricity, something taken so much for granted in the \ndeveloped world, is still a luxury for far too many people \nand businesses. Access to knowledge, information \nand technology will also play an important role. It is \nlevelling the economic playing field for developing \ncountries and is beginning to break the cycle of poverty.\n\nPost-2015 presents an opportunity to turn that new \nsense of possibility into a reality, to give people in \ndeveloping nations increased opportunity. In Rwanda \nwe are on course to meet all the MDG targets, but for us \nthey are the floor, not the ceiling. We remain tireless in \nour pursuit of progress, because we know all too well the \ncost of failure. Next April, Rwanda will commemorate \nthe twentieth anniversary of the genocide. Over three \nlong months, flickers of life went out all over the \ncountry, but today Rwandans are standing strong, \nhaving overcome adversity. In building a new nation, \nwe have a purpose that is shaped by a tragic past but \nfocused firmly on the future. And as within the larger \nAfrican and world community we move towards the \nnext chapter of global development, we must create \nstrong and meaningful partnerships that have a positive \nimpact on the lives of all. Together, we can make sure \nthat the post-2015 era is defined by opportunity and \noptimism, prosperity and progress, dignity and hope.\n\nOn another issue of critical importance, Africans \nsupported the global consensus against impunity and \nthe creation of an international justice system to fight \nit. We did so on the understanding that such a system \nwould promote peace and security within and between \nnations, and that it would uphold the principle of the \nequal sovereignty of nations. In practice, however, \nthe International Criminal Court (ICC) has flouted \nthose principles. It has shown an open bias against \nAfricans. Instead of promoting justice and peace, it \nhas undermined reconciliation efforts and helped to \nhumiliate Africans and leaders, as well as serving the \npolitical interests of the powerful. \n\nNowhere have the shortcomings of the ICC been \nmore evident than in the ongoing trial of Kenyan leaders. \nThe people of Kenya have shown their eagerness to heal \nthe wounds of their past, reconcile and move on. That \nis why they elected the current leaders who are on trial. \nThose efforts to reconcile their communities and move \nforward should be supported, and development of the \nnational judicial capacity to fight impunity should be \npromoted rather than undermined. \n\nThe General Assembly and the Security Council \nshould be examining this matter as well as the wider \nissues of universal jurisdiction that have already been \nbrought before them. That is the least we can do to \nuphold the principles of justice and the equality of \nnations, support reconciliation processes and respect \nthe dignity of Africans.\n"

And I take this occasion to reiterate \nour thanks to the Secretary-General, His Excellency \nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his leadership and dedication to \nthe United Nations.\n\nI would also like to take this opportunity to express \nour solidarity with and deepest condolences to the \nGovernment and people of Kenya in the wake of the \nrecent terrorist attacks there, which resulted in the loss \nof life and great pain to the people of that nation.\n\nBarely 800 days remain until the deadline for the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) is reached \nand a post-2015 development agenda launched. It is \nappropriate, therefore, that the Assembly has been \ninvited to focus its attention on the theme of \u201cThe post-\n2015 development agenda: setting the stage\u201d. A review \nof our experience to date will reveal that the world as \na whole has witnessed substantial progress towards the \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \nHowever, prospects vary significantly within and across \ncountries and regions, and a large number of countries \nare likely to come short in achieving the Goals.\n\nHealth and education challenges threaten the \nsustainability of hard-earned socioeconomic gains. \nToday, still more than 1 billion people live in extreme \npoverty and one in eight persons on the planet \u2014 among \nthem 200 million children \u2014 suffer from chronic \nundernourishment. In addition, we still have 57 million \nchildren who are out of school. This needs to be \nurgently corrected. We must also pay special attention \nto the quality of education in order to develop a \ngeneration of global citizens who are capable of rising \nto the challenges of the future. To this end, Guyana \nsupports the Secretary-General\u2019s Global Education \nFirst Initiative as an instrument for the development \nof meaningful solutions to the challenges regarding \naccess to and quality of education.\n\nIf we are to make this world a better place for \neveryone, we must also address the issue of inequality. \n\n\f\nIncome distribution continues to be skewed in favour \nof the rich nations and rich persons within nations. \nThis gap has grown dangerously wide. Needless to say, \ninequality leads to great discontent and social unrest. \nAt the heart of many of the conflicts we see today is \nthe widening gap between the haves and have-nots. \nSometimes this is not readily visible, as the fight \nfor social and economic justice is often clouded by \ninter-ethnic, interreligious and other types of conflicts.\n\nTo defend the gains that we have made and to \nexpand further, it is necessary for the United Nations \nto focus on narrowing the gaps in income, access to \nsocial services, infrastructure, land distribution and \nother critical areas. If there is one lesson to be drawn \nfrom efforts to achieve the Millennium Development \nGoals, it is that addressing inequality is crucial to the \nachievement of sustainable development objectives. The \napproach adumbrated in the resolution on a new global \nhuman order (resolution 65/120) remains relevant in the \nstruggle to eradicate poverty and inequality and indeed \nthe post-2015 development agenda.\n\nIn setting the stage for a post-2015 agenda, we \nmust build on and expand the gains made. To this end, \nwe must create an international environment that will \nfacilitate the achievement of the goals that we will set \nfor the future. Central to our efforts must be the focus \non world peace. Peace and development are inseparable. \nPeace will be realized only if international law and \nthe rights of nations and their sovereignty are always \nrespected and upheld.\n\nIt is in this regard that I wish to view the situation \nin the Middle East. At the moment, Syria is at the \ncentre of our collective concern. The war in that sister \nnation has taken thousands of innocent lives. It is an \nillusion to believe that military intervention will bring \npeace to that country. What is badly needed is political \ndialogue among the Syrian parties. The international \ncommunity also has an important role to play. We \nwelcome the agreement between Russia and the United \nStates that will facilitate the destruction of chemical \nweapons held in Syria. We call on all countries that \npossess such weapons to do the same. We hope too, that \nterrorist forces operating in Syria will withdraw. After \nall, they cannot be terrorists when they were fighting \nin Afghanistan and Iraq, but freedom fighters when \nfighting the Syrian Government. A terrorist is simply \na terrorist.\n\nIn the same way, let me say that a blow was struck \nagainst democracy when the coup took place in Egypt. \nHowever, the major world Powers, instead of condemning \nthe use of such means to change Governments, chose \nto remain silent. This gave tacit support to the coup, \nwhich has led to violations of human rights and loss \nof innocent lives, and may lead to more protests and \npossibly violence and death. Nevertheless, it is our \nfervent hope that the people of that great brotherly \ncountry and their leaders, regardless of their political \npersuasion, will find a peaceful way out of the present \ndifficulties.\n\nMoreover, peace in the Middle East will not be \nrealized until we have a just solution to the Palestinian \ntragedy. The Palestinian people have the right to their \nown country. We support them in their quest for the \nright to live in peace and in an independent, viable \nPalestinian State.\n\nTurning to our own region, allow me to underscore \nthat the blockade against our sister Caribbean country \nCuba has caused serious damage to that country\u2019s \neconomy and continues to be a major obstacle to \ndevelopment. We join the call for a lifting of the \nblockade and the removal of the burden that it places on \nthe Cuban people.\n\nThe adoption in April of the landmark Arms Trade \nTreaty opens the door to effective regulation of the \ninternational trade in conventional arms. For us in \nthe Caribbean, the Treaty bears relevance not only to \nthe safety and security of our citizens and to the fight \nagainst transnational crime, but also, in an important \nway, to our overall pursuit of sustainable development. \nThe funnelling of guns into our societies is a menace \nthat must be curbed in order to preserve our young \npeople and our future. As one of the first countries to \nratify the Treaty, Guyana urges all States to work to \nassure its early entry into force.\n\nWhile peace is vital to development, let me hasten \nto add that socioeconomic progress coupled with \ndemocracy is crucial to the preservation of peace. \nCentral to these principles are our people. They remain \nthe most important factor for development. That is \nwhy my country has been increasingly investing in \nthe development of our people. An examination of our \nnational budget will reveal that some 30 per cent of our \nexpenditure goes to the social sector. As a result, we \nhave managed to achieve several of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals well before the time envisaged. \nWe have achieved universal primary education and are \nclose to achieving universal secondary education. \n\n\n\f\nWe have also slashed poverty by more than half. \nMoreover, according to the Food and Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations, we are one of the \nfew countries in the world that have not only reduced \npoverty but also improved nutrition. The eradication of \npoverty and the promotion of sustainable development \nmust become a key principle and objective of global \neconomic governance and a guidepost for the action of \ninternational financial and trade institutions.\n\nWhile I speak of these achievements, I would \nbe remiss if I did not point out the grave challenges \nconfronting us even as we seek to build on the \nfoundations that have already been laid. We in the \nCaribbean have experienced major setbacks due to the \ninternational economic and financial crises that started \nin North America and Europe. While it appears that \nthose two regions are emerging from the crises, the \neffects continue to be devastating in the Caribbean. \nEven as we continue to grapple with the effects of the \nfinancial crisis, we are now faced with the graduation \nand differentiation imposed by some of our international \npartners. \n\nWe are told that as middle-income countries, \nmeasured by per capita gross domestic product (GDP), \nwe are no longer entitled to concessionary financing. \nThis is a recipe for reversing the gains made over the \nyears of hard work and sacrifice. We call for a rethink \nof that position and urge that greater consideration \nbe given to the special vulnerabilities of our region, \nwhere a country can see its entire GDP wiped out by \na single hurricane or, as in our country in 2005, when \n60 per cent of its GDP was wiped out because of floods. \nClearly what we need is increased cooperation with the \ninternational community and our development partners, \nand not less.\n\nAnother serious challenge to sustainable \ndevelopment is the impact of climate change. This is \neven more the case for small island developing States, \nwhich are represented in the Assembly. Some of them \nface an imminent passage to oblivion. Climate change is \nnot of our making but, sadly, as small island developing \nStates and low-lying coastal States, we remain the \nvictims of its most adverse impacts. Unfortunately, \ninstead of a reduction in the emissions of greenhouse \ngases, there has been a rise of nearly 50 per cent. This \nmarked failure to take decisive action poses a threat to \nall humankind. It is tragic that while we all know that \ndangers that lurk due to global warming and climate \nchange, we seem incapable of stopping ourselves. \nWe therefore welcome the initiative of the Secretary-\nGeneral to convene a summit on climate change, and \nhope that it will result in a strong political consensus \nfor addressing this paramount challenge of our time.\n\nWe welcome the observance of 2014 as the \nInternational Year of Small Island Developing States, \nand call on the international community to seize the \nchance to take a serious approach to meaningfully \nassist such States, in particular in relation to building \nresilience and disaster risk management. To that end, \na special fund must be established and made easily \naccessible.\n\nIn setting the stage for the post-2015 development \nagenda, we believe that we should intensify efforts \nto eradicate poverty. The United Nations must not \nallow that objective to be lost among the many other \ndemands that exist. The United Nations also has a role \nto play in ensuring that the poorer, smaller developing \ncountries are not always put at a disadvantage at the \nlevel of international economic discourse and action. \nIt is critical that this body pursue and encourage \nmultilateral approaches to international and global \nproblems. Experience has shown that even though \nthe multilateral approach is often slow, it is the only \napproach that can lead to lasting peace, democracy and \njustice in our world.\n"

        "file_text": "I would first like to \nbriefly express my pleasure at seeing the representative \nof Antigua and Barbuda, a country that is part of the \nCaribbean and is very dear to Brazil and our region, \nat the helm of the proceedings of this session of the \nGeneral Assembly. You can count on the permanent \nsupport of my Government, Sir.\n\nBefore I begin my statement, I would also like \nto voice the Brazilian Government\u2019s and people\u2019s \nrepudiation of the recent terrorist attack in Nairobi, and \nto convey our condolences to and express our solidarity \nwith the families of the victims and the people and the \nGovernment of Kenya. Wherever terrorism may occur \nand wherever it originates, we will always condemn it \nunequivocally and resolve firmly to deal with it. We \nwill never compromise with barbarity.\n\nI would like to draw the Assembly\u2019s attention to \nan exceedingly important and serious matter. Recent \nrevelations concerning the activities of a global network \nof electronic espionage have provoked indignation and \ndisgust in public opinion worldwide. For Brazil the \nsituation is particularly serious, since we have been a \nspecific target of that intrusion. Citizens\u2019 personal data \nhas been indiscriminately targeted and intercepted. \nBusiness information, often of major economic and even \nstrategic value, has been a focus of espionage activity. \nAnd communications of Brazilian diplomatic missions, \nincluding our Permanent Mission to the United Nations \nand the Office of the President of the Republic itself, \nhave been subject to interception.\n\nSuch meddling in the lives and affairs of other \ncountries is a breach of international law and as such \nis an affront to the principles that should govern \nrelations between them, and between friendly nations \nin particular. A nation can never promote its own \nsovereignty in a way that damages the sovereignty of \nanother. The right of one country\u2019s citizens to security \ncan never be ensured by violating the fundamental \nhuman and civil rights of those of another. It is even \nworse when private companies support such espionage \nactivity. The argument that the illegal interception of \ninformation and data is allegedly intended to protect \nagainst terrorism is untenable.\n\nBrazil knows how to protect itself. We repudiate \nand fight terrorist groups; we do not give them shelter. \nWe are a democratic country surrounded by democratic, \npeaceful countries that respect international law. We \nhave lived in peace with our neighbours for more than \n140 years. Like many other Latin Americans, I have \nfought arbitrary behaviour and censorship myself and \ntherefore cannot possibly fail to uncompromisingly \ndefend individuals\u2019 right to privacy and the sovereignty \nof my country. \n\nWithout the right to privacy there is no real \nfreedom of speech and opinion and therefore no genuine \ndemocracy. Without respect for sovereignty there is \nno basis for normal relations among nations. What we \nhave before us is a serious violation of human rights \nand civil liberties through the invasion and capture of \nconfidential secret information pertaining to business \nactivities and, above all, a case of disrespect for the \nnational sovereignty of my country. We have registered \nour protest with the Government of the United States \nand we have demanded explanations, apologies and \nguarantees that such procedures will never be repeated.\n\nFriendly Governments and societies that seek \nto build a truly strategic partnership, as in our case, \n\n\n\f\ncannot possibly allow recurring illegal actions to take \nplace as if they constituted a normal, ordinary practice. \nThey are unacceptable. Brazil will redouble its efforts \nto adopt legislation, technologies and mechanisms to \nprotect us adequately from the illegal interception of \ncommunications and data. My Administration will \ndo everything within its reach and powers to defend \nthe human rights of all Brazilians and all the world\u2019s \ncitizens, as well as to protect the fruits of the ingenuity \nof Brazilian workers and companies.\n\nThe problem, however, goes beyond the bilateral \nrelationship of two countries. It affects the international \ncommunity itself and demands a response from it. \nInformation and telecommunication technologies \ncannot become the new battlefield among States. \nThe time is ripe to create the conditions to prevent \ncyberspace from being used as a weapon of war through \nespionage, sabotage and attacks against the systems and \ninfrastructure of other countries. The United Nations \nmust play a leading role in the effort to properly regulate \nthe conduct of States with regard to those technologies. \nIt should also consider the importance of the Internet \nand social networks as part of our efforts to build \ndemocracy worldwide.\n\nFor that reason, Brazil will present proposals for \nthe establishment of a multilateral civil framework \nfor the governance and use of the Internet, as well \nas measures to guarantee the effective protection \nof the data and information that traverse it. We must \nestablish multilateral mechanisms for the worldwide \nweb that are capable of ensuring key principles. The \nfirst is freedom of expression, individual privacy and \nrespect for human rights; secondly, multilateral, open \ndemocratic governance, conducted with transparency \nwhile stimulating collective creativity and the broad \nparticipation of civil society, Governments and the \nprivate sector; thirdly, the principle of universality, \nwhich ensures social and human development along with \nthe construction of inclusive and non-discriminatory \nsocieties; fourthly, cultural diversity, without the \nimposition of beliefs, customs or values; and fifthly, the \nneutrality of the web, which must be governed only by \ntechnical and ethical criteria, rendering unacceptable \nany restriction of it for political, commercial, religious \nor any other purposes. Harnessing the full potential of \nthe Internet therefore requires responsible regulation \nthat will simultaneously guarantee the freedom of \nexpression, security and respect for human rights.\n\nThe choice of the post-2015 development agenda \nas the theme for this session of the General Assembly \ncould not be more appropriate. The fight against \npoverty, hunger and inequality constitutes the greatest \nchallenge of our time. For that reason, Brazil has \nadopted a socially inclusive economic model based \non generating employment, strengthening small-\nscale family agriculture, expanding credit, increasing \nthe worth of salaries and developing a vast social \nprotection network, particularly through our family \nstipend programme. In addition to those achievements, \nwe have lifted 22 million Brazilians out of extreme \npoverty in only two years through out plan to free \nBrazil of extreme poverty. We have drastically reduced \nchild mortality. A recent UNICEF report indicates \nthat Brazil has achieved one of the most significant \nreductions in the child mortality in the world.\n\nChildren are a top priority for Brazil. That is \nreflected in our commitment to education. We are the \ncountry that has most increased public investment in \neducation, according to the latest Organization for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development report. We \nhave also just approved legislation that earmarks 75 per \ncent of all petroleum revenue to education and 25 per \ncent to health services.\n\nIn the debate on the post-2015 development \nagenda we must focus on the results of the Rio de \nJaneiro United Nations Conference on Sustainable \nDevelopment as key drivers. The major step taken in \nRio de Janeiro was to place poverty at the very centre \nof the sustainable development agenda. Poverty is \nnot a problem exclusive to developing countries, and \nenvironmental protection is not a goal to achieve only \nafter poverty is overcome. The meaning of the post-\n2015 agenda is the development of a world in which it is \npossible to grow, to include, to conserve and to protect. \nBy promoting social mobility and overcoming extreme \npoverty, as we are doing, we have created an immense \ncontingent of citizens with improved quality of life, \nincreased access to information and greater awareness \nof their rights \u2014 citizens with new hopes, new desires \nand new demands.\n\nThe demonstrations last June in Brazil were an \ninseparable part of our process of building democracy \nand of social change. My Administration did not repress \nthem; on the contrary, it listened to and understood the \nvoices from the streets. We listened and understood \nbecause we ourselves came from the streets. We \nourselves came of age and developed through the great \n\n\n\f\nstruggles of Brazil. The street is our ground, our base. \nThe protesters did not ask for a return to the past. \nRather, they asked for further progress towards a future \nof greater rights, more participation and more social \ngains.\n\nIn Brazil, it was during this decade that we \nexperienced the greatest reduction in social inequality \nin the past 50 years. It was during this decade that we \ncreated a system of social protection that has allowed \nus to nearly eradicate extreme poverty. We know all \ntoo well that democracy generates the desire for more \ndemocracy, that social inclusion creates demands for \nfurther social inclusion, and that quality of life awakens \npeople\u2019s yearning for even more quality of life. For us, \nall the progress achieved thus far is just a beginning. \nOur development strategy demands more, as desired by \nall Brazilians.\n\nIt is not enough to listen. We must act. We must \ntransform this extraordinary energy into achievements \nfor everyone. I have therefore launched five major \npacts: a pact against corruption and for political \nreform; a pact for urban mobility, geared towards \nthe improvement of public transportation and urban \nreform; a pact for education, our great passport to the \nfuture, which will be supported by royalties from oil \nrevenues and the petroleum social fund; a health pact \nthat provides for doctors to assist Brazilians in the \npoorest and most remote regions of the country; and \na fiscal responsibility pact, to guarantee the economic \nviability of this new stage in our history.\n\nAlthough the most acute phase of the crisis is behind \nus, the situation of the world economy remains fragile, \nwith unacceptable levels of unemployment. According \nto statistics from the International Labor Organization, \nthere are more than 200 million unemployed people \nthroughout the world. That phenomenon affects \npopulations of both developed and developing countries. \n\nThis is the right time for us to strengthen the trends \nfor growth in the world\u2019s economy, which is showing \nsigns of recovery. Emerging countries alone cannot \nensure the resumption of global growth. More than ever \nbefore, it is necessary to engage in concerted action \nin order to reduce unemployment and re-establish \nmomentum in international trade. We are all in the \nsame boat.\n\nMy country is restoring growth despite the impact \nof the international crisis of the past few years. We \nhave relied on three key elements: first, a commitment \ntowards sound macroeconomic policies; secondly, \ncontinuing and upholding successful social inclusion \npolicies; and thirdly, the adoption of measures aimed \nat increasing our productivity, and therefore our \ninternational competitiveness. We are committed to \nstability and inflation-control, to improving the quality \nof public spending and to upholding proper fiscal \nperformance. \n\nWe reiterate our support for a reform of the \nInternational Monetary Fund. The governance of \nthe Fund should reflect the weight of emerging and \ndeveloping countries in the world economy. Delaying \nsuch adaptive reform will further reduce the Fund\u2019s \nlegitimacy and effectiveness.\n\nThe year 2015 will mark the seventieth anniversary \nof the United Nations and the tenth anniversary of the \n2005 World Summit. As such, it will be an occasion \nfor us to carry out the urgent reform that we have been \ncalling for since that first summit. We must avoid a \ncollective defeat of coming to 2015 without a Security \nCouncil capable of fully exercising its responsibilities in \ntoday\u2019s world. The limited representation in the Security \nCouncil, in view of the new challenges of the twenty-\nfirst century, is a source of grave concern. Examples of \nthat concern include the huge difficulty in providing a \nsolution for the ongoing Syrian conflict and the state of \nparalysis in addressing the Israeli-Palestinian question. \nThe recurrent polarization among permanent members \non important issues has led to a dangerous inaction. The \nCouncil must be urgently endowed with voices that are \nboth independent and constructive. Only by expanding \nthe number of permanent and non-permanent members \nof the Security Council and by including developing \ncountries in both categories will it be possible to \nsolve and overcome the current representativeness and \nlegitimacy deficits from which the Council suffers.\n\nThe general debate provides us with an opportunity \nto reiterate the fundamental principles that guide my \ncountry\u2019s foreign policy and inform our stance on \npressing issues on today\u2019s international agenda. We \nguide ourselves and our actions through a defence of a \nmultilateral world governed by international law, where \nthe peaceful solution of conflicts holds sway and where \nthe pursuit of a fair and solidarity-based order prevails \nboth economically and socially.\n\nThe crisis in Syria has caused unrest and breeds a \nsense of anger. Two and a half years of lives lost and \ndestruction have caused the greatest humanitarian \ndisaster of the century.\n\n\n\f\nBrazil\u2019s population of Syrian descent is an important \ncomponent of our nationality identity, Our country \nis thus deeply involved with the plight of the Syrian \npeople. It is necessary to prevent the killing of innocent \npeople \u2014 women, children and the elderly \u2014 and to \nsilence weapons, whether they be conventional or \nchemical or whether they be used by the Government \nor by the rebels. There is no military way out. The \nonly solution is through negotiation, dialogue and \nunderstanding.\n\nSyria\u2019s decision to accede to the Chemical Weapons \nConvention and enforce it immediately was an important \ndevelopment. As such, the measure is decisive for \novercoming the conflict and helps build a world free of \nchemical weapons. I would like to stress that the use of \nsuch weapons is heinous and unacceptable under any \ncircumstances. We therefore support the agreement \nreached between the United States and the Russian \nFederation to eliminate Syria\u2019s chemical weapons. It \nis incumbent upon the Syrian Government to fulfil the \nagreement in its entirety and do so in good faith and \nin a spirit of cooperation. Under all circumstances and \nin any case, we repudiate unilateral interventions in \nviolation of international law and without authorization \nby the Security Council. Unilateral intervention would \nonly further worsen the lack of political stability in the \nregion and would increase human suffering. \n\nLikewise, lasting peace between Israel and Palestine \nhas taken on a new and pressing dimension given the \nsweeping changes that the Middle East is currently \nundergoing. The time has come to meet the legitimate \nPalestinian aspiration for an independent and sovereign \nState. The time has also come for us to bring about a \nbroad international consensus for a two-State solution. \nThe current talks between Israelis and Palestinians \nshould yield practical and significant results in favour \nof an agreement.\n\nThe history of the twentieth century shows that \nabandoning the multilateral system is a prelude to \nwar, with the ensuing trail of human destitution and \ndevastation. The history of the twentieth century \nalso shows that promoting the multilateral system \nbears fruit on the ethical, political and institutional \nfronts. May I therefore renew an appeal for a broad, \nvigorous convergence of political will that will uphold \nand reinvigorate the multilateral system, of which the \nUnited Nations is the main pillar.\n\nWhen the United Nations was founded, the peoples \nof the world rallied around the hope that humankind \nwould be able to overcome the wounds of the Second \nWorld War and the hope that, yes, it would be possible \nto build, from the rubble of destruction and massacre, \na new world of liberty, solidarity and prosperity. We all \nhave the responsibility not to let such a generous and \nfruitful hope die. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, \nI warmly congratulate Mr. John Ashe on his election as \nPresident of the General Assembly. I wish him every \nsuccess in his endeavours. I also wish to convey my \ngreetings to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon and to \ncommend him and his team for the remarkable efforts \nthey continue to exert in the realization of the lofty \npurposes and principles that have been at the heart of \nthe United Nations since its inception.\n\nI have the honour to speak before the Assembly \ntoday on behalf of my country, the new Libya, which \nis forging ahead towards democracy, establishing \nState institutions, the rule of law, development and \nprosperity, despite the range of political, economic, \nsocial and cultural difficulties and obstacles we face \nas a result of the burdensome legacy left behind by the \ndictatorial regime. I wish to assure the international \ncommunity, and the United Nations in particular, \nthat Libya is working tirelessly, with confidence and \ndetermination, to establish State laws and institutions, \nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms \nand the peaceful transfer of power, as well as to forge \npositive partnerships with development partners that \nare fully respectful of the interests of all countries, \nincluding non-interference in the internal affairs of \nother States, and to promote peace and security in \naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations and \ninternational laws and norms.\n\nThe people of Libya will always highly appreciate \nthe important role played by the United Nations in the \nestablishment of Libya, beginning with resolution 289 \n(IV), of 21 November 1949, on the independence of \nLibya, through to the Security Council\u2019s adoption of \nresolutions 1970 (2011) and 1973 (2011), to protect Libyan \ncivilians and support the revolution of 17 February 2011. \nThat positive role continues through the United Nations \nSupport Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), which is making \ncommendable and praiseworthy efforts to provide \ntechnical advice and training, raise awareness and \nbuild capacity in various sectors in order to advance the \ndemocratization process, achieve justice and national \nreconciliation and rebuild modern State institutions. \nUNSMIL has been crucial in launching and supporting \na national dialogue, which will start in a few days. The \nCouncil of Ministers is now considering a draft law on \nvictims of rape and violence during the dictatorial era \nand the liberation war. \n\nIn response to the relevant Security Council \nresolutions, we are cooperating with the International \nCriminal Court (ICC) in order to expand the scope of \ninvestigations into those who committed crimes against \nthe Libyan people, through the implementation of the \nmechanisms and rulings of the ICC and in line with \nnational legislation. We are looking forward to the \ncooperation of the countries concerned, in particular \nneighbouring countries, in surrendering and extraditing \nthe wanted individuals of the former regime.\n\nWe trust that an understanding will be reached \nwith the United Nations, and the Security Council \nin particular, with regard to security and the need to \nimpose control over our vast land and sea borders and \nto lift the ban on arms completely. Libya faces a broad \nrange of problems caused by illegal migration. This \nrequires efforts to be coordinated at the international \nand regional levels in order to find an urgent solution \n\n\n\f\nand curb the phenomenon of illegal migration, ensure \nrespect for the sovereignty of States, promote and \nensure the rights and dignity of the illegal migrants \nthemselves and enhance cooperation with international \norganizations.\n\nI would be remiss if I failed to express my \nsincere gratitude to the International Organization \nfor Migration for its cooperation with the relevant \ninternational institutions. I also wish to thank the \nEuropean Union for its assistance to Libya in curbing \nthe problem of illegal migration through its assistance \nto Libyan institutions in securing the vast borders.\n\nLibya faces a number of security threats, including \nthe illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs and psychotropic \nsubstances, illegal migration and arms smuggling. That \nis why we hosted a regional ministerial conference \non border security in March 2012, which included the \nadoption of the Tripoli action plan for border cooperation \nand the establishment of mechanisms and structures \nfor cooperation and the sharing of information and \nexperience in the field of border protection and control.\n\nIn addition, last spring, the Libyan city of Ghadames \nhosted a meeting of the Heads of Government of \nLibya, Algeria and Tunisia to strengthen joint security \noperations in addressing the challenges posed by \ndevelopments in the Sahel and Sahara regions.\n\nWe also contributed to the ministerial conference \non support to Libya in the areas of security, justice and \nthe rule of law, which was held in Paris in February \nat the initiative of the Libyan interim Government and \nwith the support of the French and British Governments. \nTwo action plans were adopted at that meeting on the \ndevelopment of the Libyan security and justice sectors.\n\nThe interim Government is sparing no efforts in \nreactivating the role of the Arab Maghreb group to \npromote political, development and security cooperation \nand to promote the interests of all countries in North \nAfrica and the Arab Maghreb. Libya is taking all the \nnecessary steps to get back on the path to development \nand to complete national projects in all sectors, which \nrequires substantial funds. It is crucial that we recover \nthe looted funds that were smuggled out of Libya. From \nthis rostrum, I reiterate the call that we made to all \nStates to cooperate with and help us locate and recover \nthose funds.\n\nWe also emphasize our request to the countries in \nwhich there are Libyan investments to ensure the right \nof the Libyan State to those investments and to prevent \nany compromise thereof, especially in some countries \nin Africa, Asia and Latin America, where coercive \nmeasures have caused significant damage to those \ninvestments.\n\nMy country attaches great importance to human \nrights issues and to the process of safeguarding and \npromoting those rights. Preventing any violations \nin this area is therefore a priority for Libya\u2019s interim \nGovernment. That is why our Government, in \ncoordination with the General National Congress, \nhas taken a number of steps to that end. They include \namending or repealing legislation that is inconsistent \nwith the international obligations of the Libyan State in \nthe field of human rights, as well as setting in motion \na process of constitutional review of legislation that \nruns counter to the provisions of the Constitutional \nDeclaration. We are also taking steps to ratify or accede \nto certain international human rights conventions, \nincluding the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities and its Optional Protocol. Preparations are \nunder way to accede to other international agreements, \nsuch as the Optional Protocol to the Convention against \nTorture and the International Convention for the \nProtection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. \n\nA further step includes developing a practical \nmechanism for the implementation Human Rights \nCouncil decision 19/39, in order to provide technical \nassistance and capacity-building to Libya through \ndirect cooperation between the Libyan Government and \nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \nfor Human Rights, with the assistance of UNSMIL. \nWe are also establishing a ministerial committee to \nfollow up on the situation of human rights in Libya, \nheaded by the Minister of Justice and including the \ndeputy ministers of the interior, defence and culture, \nas well as representatives of civil society. We are \nmaking every effort to prepare for the visit to Libya \nby High Commissioner Navi Pillay before the end \nof this year. We hope that the visit will reinforce the \nrelationship between Libya and the Office of the High \nCommissioner, in the mutual interests of both.\n\nLibya contributes very seriously to the international \nefforts to eliminate weapons of mass destruction \nand safeguard international peace and security, and \nwe cooperate fully with international institutions \nand organizations in this field. We reiterate the call \nto conclude an unconditional and legally binding \ninstrument to protect non-nuclear States from the threat \nor use of nuclear weapons, pursuant to the relevant \n\n\n\f\nGeneral Assembly resolutions and in line with the 1996 \nadvisory opinion of the International Court of Justice \non the Legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons \n(A/51/218, annex).\n\nI also reaffirm Libya\u2019s full support for international \nefforts aimed at establishing additional zones free of \nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction \nin various regions of the world. To contribute to \nthe achievement of that goal, Libya is working, in \ncoordination with its brothers in the League of Arab \nStates, to convene a successful conference on making \nthe Middle East such a zone \u2014 a conference that, \nunfortunately, has been postponed. We call upon the \nSecretary-General and other organizing parties to \nmake every effort, as stipulated in the 1995 resolution \non the Middle East and the outcome document of the \n2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on \nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to convene \nthe conference before the end of 2013. We call upon all \nStates concerned to participate in in the conference in \norder to ensure its success.\n\nLibya shares the concerns of the international \ncommunity concerning the scourge of terrorism, which \nis not exclusive to any particular religion, nationality \nor culture. We have acceded to most international \ninstruments on combating terrorism and are \ncooperating with other countries in order to conclude a \ncomprehensive convention on terrorism, in accordance \nwith resolution 66/105.\n\nThe Palestinian people have now been living in \ntruly tragic humanitarian conditions for more than six \ndecades, starting with their expulsion from their homes \nand continuing with the annexation of most of their \nterritory, the confiscation and levelling of their land and \nthe demolition of their homes \u2014 all in flagrant violation \nof international humanitarian laws and norms. The \ntime has now come for the international community to \nassume its responsibilities to put an end to this tragedy \nas soon as possible by taking urgent and decisive \naction to ensure the full protection of the Palestinian \npeople and to put an end to their daily suffering and the \ninjustice done to them. That should be done through \na comprehensive solution to the Palestinian issue \nthat ends the occupation and enables the Palestinian \npeople to regain their territory and establish their own \nindependent Palestinian State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif \nas its capital, and makes it possible for all Palestinian \nrefugees to return to their homes, in accordance with \nthe relevant international resolutions.\n\nThe tragic developments taking place in Syria make \nit incumbent upon the international community to put \nan end to that human tragedy and stop the bloodshed \nand destruction. We therefore call upon the Security \nCouncil to act in accordance with the concept of the \nresponsibility to protect in order to find a solution to \nthe problem, through consensus among its members, so \nas to save the Syrian people from the daily massacres \nand help them to achieve their legitimate demands.\n\nLibya once again calls upon the international \ncommunity and human rights institutions to put an end \nto the human tragedy being experienced by the Muslim \nRohingya minority in Myanmar and to accelerate the \nsetting up of an international investigation committee \nto bring those responsible for the tragedy before \ninternational justice, ensure the return of the displaced \nto their homes and provide compensation to the victims.\n\nA revolution took place in Libya to put an end to \ndespotism and dictatorship, a revolution that was the \nresult of deep and long suffering. I assure the Assembly \nthat, with the will of the people who brought about \nthat revolution, our Government will build State \ninstitutions, uphold the rule of law, protect its borders, \nfulfil its promises, honour its obligations towards \nneighbouring countries and work for the promotion of \npeace and security. The revolution will achieve peace \nand security. I wish the Assembly every success at this \nsession.\n"

        "file_text": "A year ago \nwhen we met in the General Assembly, we joined our \nvoices to deplore the fact that the Syrian civil war had \nclaimed over 25,000 lives. One year on, it has killed \nover 100,000 men, women and children. The number \nof refugees, which stood at 250,000 in September 2012, \ndoubled by December that year, then doubled again \nby March, and then it doubled again. Today, there are \n2 million Syrians outside their country, half of them \nchildren, and under current trends, their number is close \nto doubling again, and there may be 3.5 million refugees \nbefore the year is over. We cannot let this spiral of \ncriminal, sectarian violence pursue its dreadful course \nat the heart of the world\u2019s most unstable region. What \nwill the situation be when we meet again next year?\n\nAny further paralysis of the international \ncommunity over Syria is simply untenable. It was \nalready true this summer, but worse was yet to come. \nFive weeks ago in the outskirts of Damascus, there was \na new threshold of tragedy, a crime against humanity, \nand in response the stakes were raised. Today we are in \na new situation. \n\nThe European Union welcomes the diplomatic \nopening created in order to control and destroy \nSyria\u2019s chemical weapons. It is important in itself. We \nabsolutely must avoid a dreadful precedent being set \non the use of chemical weapons \u2014 an abhorrent crime \nagainst humanity. The role of the United Nations in \nthis respect is indispensable and has been underscored \ntime and again by the 28 Governments of the European \nUnion. \n\nFollowing the Secretary-General\u2019s report and the \ninventory of its arsenal provided by the Syrian regime, \nit is urgent for the Security Council, together with the \nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, \nto take the necessary decisions to ensure the swift and \nsecure destruction of Syria\u2019s stocks of poison gas and \nnerve agents. A clear resolution of the Security Council \nwould mark a turn, and I plea for its adoption. \n\nEliminating Syria\u2019s chemical arsenal is in itself \na major step. Potentially, it could also be important \nfor the wider dynamics in the region. Clearly, the \nconflict wrecking Syria reflects many of the deep-\nseated tensions rippling throughout the Middle East. It \nis fed by these tensions and fuels them as well. So a \nsolution for Syria will need to take the wider picture \ninto account. That is why any political opening matters \ndeeply; a breakthrough on chemical weapons could \nstart opening other doors. In the black wall of Syria\u2019s \ndoom, it will be a first crack.\n\nParadoxically, there is more scope for quiet hope \ntoday than there was even a few weeks ago. Because \nif commitments can be upheld and promises kept on \nchemical weapons, if lines of communication can reopen, \nif we can find an agreement within the international \ncommunity and at the Security Council \u2014 if we can do \nall this on chemical weapons, then chances are we can \ndo it elsewhere. \n\nThere must be ways to open up opportunities. But \nwhen new opportunities arise, we must seize them. \nOnly then will we see the outlook improve for Syria. \nNow is indeed the moment to work actively towards the \n\u201cGeneva II\u201d conference. The international community \nmust fully engage with all available diplomatic \nmeans. The first priority is to bring all parties to the \nnegotiating table. Those close to Damascus and those \nclose to the Syrian opposition must do all within their \npower to draw each side to the table. The European \nUnion is ready to provide all support needed to achieve \na political settlement. \n\nElsewhere in the region too, new opportunities must \nand can be seized, not least in the Middle East peace \nprocess, where prospects for progress look better than \nthey have for some time. All parties are returning to \nthe negotiating table with renewed seriousness. For the \nEuropean Union, the parameters are clear. Palestine and \n\n\n\f\nIsrael must be able to fulfil their legitimate aspirations \nas two States living side by side in peace and security. \nNow both parties must seize the moment. \n\nWe also hope that the expectations currently \nbuilding around the new Iranian leadership will \ntranslate into concrete steps in the interest of regional \nstability and for the nuclear talks, where all efforts \nto find a negotiated solution, through the work of the \nE3+3 led by High Representative Catherine Ashton, \nhave the European Union\u2019s full support. Both these \ndevelopments \u2014 with Israel and Palestine and with \nIran \u2014 can be mutually reinforcing with what is \ncurrently happening around Syria; there, all must be \ndone to forge the path to a political solution. \n\nOnce the \u201cGeneva II\u201d conference starts, we have to \nbe honest with ourselves. It will not be easy \u2014 ending \na war never is. It will require political will and a real \nsense of compromise. But we must recognize that the \ncost of hesitating, of not engaging, would be much \nhigher, and not only for the people of Syria. Every \nday counts. With every day of unforgivable violence, \nbitterness and trauma go deeper, radicalization and \nwarlordism gain ground, hatred and despair win. Every \nday, reconciliation in Syria and around Syria becomes \nharder. \n\nWe in Europe know that reconciliation is the \nhardest thing. The countries of our continent agreed \nto live peacefully together only after many wars, and \nmany civil wars, with huge numbers of victims \u2014 a \nprice we never want others to have to pay. And we know \nreconciliation is even harder inside a country than \nbetween countries. No longer waging war is one thing; \nliving again together is quite another. \n\nSyria \u2014 as a country and a nation \u2014 is being \ndestroyed beyond recognition. It will take time, \ncourage and perseverance to build an inclusive, united, \ndemocratic Syria, where all Syrians can feel they \nbelong and where all share a common future regardless \nof their identity and regardless of their religion. The \npromise of the Arab Spring must be met in Syria too, \njust as it must in Egypt and beyond. At heart, it is a \nshared yearning for democracy, for tolerance, for social \njustice \u2014 a powerful message in which we still believe. \n\nBut on this long path, the Syrians will need all the \nhelp they can get, just as others before, including we in \nEurope, received support when mending their nations. \nThe United Nations can play an important role in \nhelping the country to re-establish unity and in helping \nSyria eventually find justice and ensuring that there \nis no impunity and that individual perpetrators of war \ncrimes are held accountable. \n\nWe Europeans are ready to play our part in helping \nSyria to rebuild its nation, just as we are engaged today \non the ground in the humanitarian effort in Syria and in \nthe countries to which refugees have flown, not least in \nLebanon and Jordan, where the situation is extremely \nworrying. Our countries and institutions are working \nclosely with the United Nations High Commissioner \nfor Refugees to bring food, protection and shelter, as \nwell as medical help and education. By far the biggest \naid provider for Syria, jointly we have already provided \n\u20ac1.8 billion \u2014 some $2.4 billion \u2014 and we know that \nmore will be needed.\n\n(spoke in French)\nWe do so because Europe is ready to continue to \nplay its role in the world. To many countries, whether in \nAfrica, Latin America or Asia or from the Mediterranean \nto the Caspian, the European Union is a faithful partner \nin development, peace and security, for the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and world propserity through open \ntrade. We are a strong partner in the fight against the \nextremism and barbarism of which the events in Kenya, \nPakistan and Iraq are recent and tragic manifestations.\n\nDespite the financial crisis that is testing our \neconomies, we do not disengage from our responsibilities \nin the world. Despite the crisis, we have maintained all \nEuropean funding for development and humanitarian \naction in our common European budget, even as we \nreduce its size. Despite the crisis, we maintain our \npolitical and financial commitment against climate \nchange in Europe and the world, and we will lend our \nfull support to the international conference in Paris in \n2015.\n\nIndeed, despite the crisis, the European Union \nlaunched no fewer than five new European civilian \nor military missions over the past two years aimed at \nsupporting reconstruction in Mali and South Sudan and \nre-establishing security in the Sahel and along Libya\u2019s \nborders and off the coast of Somalia. Moreover, in \n2013 we renewed operational mandates in Afghanistan, \nGeorgia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \nIn crisis and conflict areas, the European presence \non the ground is composed of doctors, paramedics, \nagronomists and engineers; it also includes magistrates \nand police and military personnel \u2014 men and women \nwho assist their local counterparts in efforts to stabilize \n\n\n\f\na country, re-establish order and the rule of law, restore \nthe sense of justice and build confidence in the future.\n\n(spoke in English)\nEurope is not disengaging, despite the economic \ndifficulties that the past few years have brought. The \nglobal financial crisis, which started in this very city \nfive years ago, shook Europe and brought forth global \nimbalances that we have worked hard to address. We \nare putting our house in order and expect others to do \nso too. Internal imbalances need to be corrected and \nstructural reforms pursued in countries all across the \nglobe. For us, the results are starting to show. Today the \neurozone is in better financial shape than 12 months \nago. The existential threat to the euro area is over, and \nwe are now focusing fully on improving prospects \nfor employment and growth. We have launched far-\nreaching efforts, focused on the long term. It will take \ntime before results show, in terms of strong economic \ngrowth and jobs, but once they start doing so, as they are \nnow, they will be longer lasting. Next year, economic \ngrowth is projected for all but one of our 28 countries.\n\nOur political will to preserve Europe\u2019s unity cannot \nbe underestimated \u2014 we have shown it over the past \nfive years \u2014 for, ultimately, it is a political project that \nunites us: to bring together countries; to bring together \npeople.\n\n(spoke in French)\nIn the month of September 2013, here in New York, \nthe international community can and must make a \ncomeback. It is our common responsibility, shared by \nall of us present here today, to translate the positive \nsigns into concrete progress for peace and prosperity. \nI therefore call for negotiation, dialogue and the \nconclusion of international agreements based on the \nconviction \u2014 which is at the very foundation of this \nOrganization \u2014 that international political progress \nhappens through the free exchange of ideas among \ncountries.\n\nThat holds true for Syria, with regard to both \nchemical weapons and the \u201cGeneva II\u201d conference. It \nholds true for the Middle East peace process and for \nthe nuclear talks with Iran. But it also holds true for \nall the other great global challenges. It is from here in \nNew York that a new momentum can and must emerge \nfor the important upcoming global meetings on climate \nchange, in Warsaw in November, on free trade in Bali \nin December, or on financial regulation at the Group of \n20 in Brisbane next year. To exchange words that bring \nabout action is itself an act of hope, and it is precisely \nhope that we need.\n\nHope is in our hands.\n"

        "file_text": " It is with great pleasure \nthat I congratulate the President on his election to his \nhigh office to preside over the General Assembly at \nits sixty-eighth session, which is being held under the \ntheme: \u201cThe post-2015 development agenda: setting the \nstage\u201d. I wish to assure the President of the full support \nand cooperation of my delegation in the successful \ndischarge of his heavy responsibilities. I would also \nlike to commend his predecessor for the able leadership \nhe demonstrated during the previous session.\n\nLet me begin by condemning the terrorist attacks in \nKenya that claimed the lives of innocent civilians and \nleft many more injured. I wish to express my heartfelt \ncondolences to the people and Government of Kenya, \nas well as to the families of the victims of that callous \nattack. That incident once again demonstrates the need \nfor us to renew our commitment to fight terrorism and \nextremism in all its forms and manifestations.\n\nI am addressing the Assembly today not only on \nbehalf of my country but also as the representative of \nthe African Union (AU), which Ethiopia has the honour \nof chairing this year. It is a welcome coincidence that \nEthiopia, which played host to the founding Conference \nof the Organization of African Unity (OAU), 50 years \nago, has assumed the rotating chairpersonship of \nthat premier continental organization at a time when \nits golden jubilee is being celebrated. We were very \npleased to host the Special Summit of African Heads \nof State and Government, which marked the OAU/\nAU jubilee on 25 May, and I would like to take this \nopportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to all \nthose who sent delegations to Addis Ababa to take part \nin the celebration and conveyed messages of support \nand solidarity to the African Union. Since the fiftieth \nanniversary will be a year-long event, we would like \nto continue to mark the historic milestone during this \nsession of the General Assembly by reflecting on the \nrelations between the United Nations and the then \nOrganization of African Union and today\u2019s African \nUnion over the past half-century.\n\nWhen the Charter of the United Nations was \nsigned in 1945, much of Africa was under the yoke \nof colonialism. Since then, our continent has been \nliberated from the remnants of colonialism and other \nforms of subjugation. Today, it is gratifying to note \n\n\n\f\nthat African countries constitute one of the largest \ngroups in the General Assembly. I would like to take \nthis opportunity to express my profound appreciation \nfor the invaluable contribution of the United Nations \nto the decolonization process. However, we should not \nlose sight of the fact that not all the challenges we faced \nin that struggle have been definitively settled; nor can \nwe say that the process of decolonization has come to \nan end in all its forms. We should therefore renew our \ncommitment to completing the decolonization process \nin Africa.\n\nIn accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter, \nthe United Nations has indeed worked closely with \nthe African Union and other regional mechanisms \nto advance its primary objectives. Over the past \nfive decades and more, cooperation and partnership \nbetween the OAU/AU and the United Nations have \nsignificantly expanded and deepened in a wide range of \naspects and fields. We acknowledge with deep respect \nthe meaningful cooperation that the United Nations has \nprovided to the then OAU and now to the African Union \nin addressing our continent\u2019s multifaceted challenges. \n\nDespite that fact, we are also cognizant of the \nfact that a lot remains to be done to further enhance \nthe cooperation and partnership between the African \nUnion and the United Nations in the context of the \nchanging dynamics within Africa and in the world at \nlarge. I earnestly hope that this historic occasion will \nafford us a unique opportunity to reflect seriously \non our challenges and shortcomings with a view to \nstrengthening our cooperation and partnership so as to \nbetter respond to the changing environment. I believe \nwe should adopt a flexible and innovative approach \nin implementing Chapter VIII of the Charter in order \nto enhance our partnership and address our common \nchallenges.\n\nWe are celebrating the OAU/AU\u2019s golden jubilee at \na time when the stereotypical narrative of Africa as a \ncontinent afflicted by poverty, disease and conflict has \nslowly begun to change. In spite of so many persistent \ndifficulties, Africa has indeed turned the corner in \nreducing the number of conflicts plaguing the continent \nand in promoting democratic governance, as well as in \nfighting poverty through accelerated economic growth \nand development. With its enhanced peace and stability, \nrapid economic growth, natural resources and growing \nmiddle class, Africa is definitely on the rise, and that \nis attracting much attention from the rest of the world. \nThe twenty-first century will be an African one if we \ndo indeed harmonize our efforts to maintain \u2014 in fact, \nspeed up \u2014 the rapid economic growth that Africa has \nbeen registering for the last decade or so. We have every \nreason to be optimistic that an African renaissance is \naround the corner. \n\nThat positive development is unquestionably \nencouraging, but we recognize that we can achieve our \naspirations for a peaceful, prosperous and integrated \nAfrica only by bringing about structural transformation. \nThat is why we are capitalizing on the golden jubilee \ncelebration to chart a transformation agenda for Africa \nto be implemented over the next 50 years. At our \nmost recent session, in May, we also adopted our AU \nCommission\u2019s strategic plan for the period 2014-2017, \nwhose main objective is to lay a solid foundation for the \nrealization of our vision in the short and medium term.\n\nIt is indeed opportune that we are crafting our \ntransformation agenda when intergovernmental \nnegotiations on the post-2015 global development \nframework have begun in earnest. I am glad that the \nAssembly will debate that issue at this session, and I \ncommend the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons \non the Post-2015 Development Agenda, co-chaired by \nthe Presidents of Indonesia and Liberia and the Prime \nMinister of the United Kingdom, for presenting their \ncomprehensive report, A New Global Partnership: \nEradicate Poverty and Transform Economies through \nSustainable Development, to the Secretary-General. I \nhope that the report will provide valuable input for our \ndiscussions of the theme \u201cThe post-2015 development \nagenda: setting the stage\u201d during this session.\n\nAfrica considers this issue to be of paramount \nimportance and has formed a high-level committee of \nHeads of State and Government to develop a common \nposition and galvanize international support in order \nto ensure that the successes achieved thus far in the \nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \nare sustained and its development priorities beyond \n2015 are fully taken on board. As the able Executive \nSecretary of the United Nations Economic Commission \nfor Africa (UNECA) has aptly put it, what Africa needs \nis structural transformation, not structural adjustment. \nThe development agenda we are trying to set for Africa \nover the next 50 years is also aimed at achieving that \nfundamental objective, with a view to eradicating \npoverty and ensuring sustainable development. With \nrespect to the work of the Open Working Group on \nSustainable Development Goals, we intend to come up \nwith a well-thought-out African position as an outcome \n\n\n\f\nof the initiative of our troika: the African Union \nCommission, UNECA and the African Development \nBank.\n\nIn that context, we want to achieve a green \nrevolution in Africa and ensure food security for our \npeoples. The theme of the African Union in 2014 will \nbe \u201cAgriculture and food security\u201d and will promote \nthe Comprehensive African Agriculture Development \nProgramme, which will allow us to reinforce our \ncommitment to the transformation of the agricultural \nsector in Africa.\n\nWe are also convinced of the need for Africa \nto industrialize in order to accelerate its economic \ngrowth, generate employment, increase income and \ndiversify exports. That can be done on the basis of our \nfactor endowments and taking into account the need \nfor us to increase added value and exploit forward \nand backward linkages. It cannot be emphasized \nenough that overcoming poverty is impossible without \nstructural transformation and value addition, which \nmakes industrialization not an option but a must \u2014 an \nunavoidable necessity for Africa. Let me state here how \ngrateful we are to all those who have made partnerships \navailable to us to ensure that Africa develops the \ncapacity for modern and affordable energy, without \nwhich industrialization would be impossible to achieve.\n\nFurthermore, we would like to invest in \ninfrastructure, which has been neglected over past \ndecades, in order to promote intra-African trade and \nfast-track regional integration. We are also committed \nto redoubling our efforts to improve the overall well-\nbeing of our society. In particular, we believe that Africa \nshould reap the benefits of its demographic dividend \nby investing in its people. Educating our youth and \nupgrading their skills is critical to the effective use of \nour human capital. Therefore we very much hope that \nthe post-2015 global development framework will be \naligned to our development priorities and needs.\n\nWe in Africa certainly recognize that we cannot \nrealize our development aspirations in the absence \nof durable peace and security. That is why we have \nconcentrated tremendous efforts in addressing the \nscourge of conflicts on our continent. We are indeed \nvery pleased to note the drastic decline in the number \nof conflicts in Africa during the last decade, with the \nexception of a few situations. But we also understand \nthat there is a new security dynamic on our continent, \nwith the rise of popular dissatisfaction associated with \ndemands yet unmet.\n\nIn that regard, the African Union has been \nexerting efforts to assist Egypt \u2014 a member State \nwhose contribution to the decolonization process on \nour continent and to African unity has been second \nto none \u2014 to overcome its current difficulties in the \nspirit of African solidarity. The African Union is also \nextending all the necessary support to Tunisia in order \nto ensure a successful political transition through \nthe adoption of a new constitution and the holding of \nelections.\n\nOn the other hand, we welcome the successful \nconduct of elections in Mali that paved the way for the \nrestoration of constitutional order in that country. The \nAfrican Union is indeed firmly committed to continue \nassisting Mali in its efforts to ensure lasting peace, \nsecurity and development. We derive satisfaction from \nthe significant progress made in Somalia towards \npeace in the country, and we are also encouraged by \nthe agreement reached between the Federal Republic \nof Somalia and the Juba Interim Administration, which \nconstitutes a significant milestone in promoting peace \nand national reconciliation. The New Deal announced \nat the Somalia Conference in Brussels on 16 September \nwill certainly strengthen the momentum for the \nreconstruction of the country and building peace there.\n\nThe security and humanitarian situation in Central \nAfrican Republic is still a matter of serious concern. I \nwish to reiterate our call to the United Nations to provide \nmultifaceted support to the African-led International \nSupport Mission in the Central African Republic, which \nwill be deployed in that country to protect civilians and \nrestore security and public order. On the other hand, \nthe escalation of tension in the eastern Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo also poses threats to the peace \nand security of the Great Lakes region and the continent \nas a whole. The only durable solution is for both the \nGovernment and the armed opposition to conclude \ntheir peace talks under the auspices of the International \nConference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR). In \nthat connection, I would like to welcome the outcome \nof the ICGLR Extraordinary Summit held in Kampala \non 5 September 2013 and High-level Political Forum \non Sustainable Development held in New York on \n23 September in New York under the auspices of the \nPresident of the Assembly.\n\nWith regard to relations between the Sudan and \nSouth Sudan, the African Union, in close collaboration \nwith the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, \nhas established an ad hoc investigation mechanism to \n\n\n\f\nverify allegations made by the two countries regarding \neach country\u2019s support for and harbouring of dissident \nelements that act against the other. The team is carrying \nout its work, and I am hopeful that the outcome of \nthe investigation will help the two countries to move \nforward in the implementation of the agreements they \nhave signed and in the normalization of their relations. \nOn a more practical level, the summits and the regular \nengagement that the leaders of the two countries are \nhaving will go a long way in breaking the impasse and \nresolving some of the difficult outstanding issues.\n\nI would like to raise one important issue that has \nbeen a matter of serious concern for us in our efforts \nto promote peace, security and national reconciliation \non the continent and regarding which there is a strong \nconsensus in Africa. Time and again, we in Africa \nhave affirmed our unflinching commitment to fighting \nimpunity and promoting democracy, rule of law and good \ngovernance throughout the continent, in conformity \nwith the Constitutive Act of the African Union. That \ncommitment has been empirically validated by bold \nactions taken recently by the African Union.\n\nWhen it comes to the International Criminal \nCourt (ICC), many of our member States ratified the \nRome Statute faithfully, subscribing to its cardinal \nobjectives and principles. Unfortunately, the manner in \nwhich the ICC has been operating has left a very bad \nimpression in Africa. Instead of promoting justice and \nreconciliation and contributing to peace and stability, \nit has degenerated into a political instrument targeting \nAfrica and Africans. This is totally unacceptable, \nand that is why Africa has been expressing its serious \nreservations against the body.\n\nIt is regrettable that our repeated request to \nthe United Nations Security Council to defer the \nproceedings initiated against President A1-Bashir \nhas been neither heard nor acted upon. We have also \nreceived no response to our request for a deferral of \nthe ICC investigations and prosecutions in relation \nto the 2008 post-election violence in Kenya, in line \nwith the principle of complementarity, to allow for a \nnational mechanism to investigate and prosecute the \ncases under a reformed judiciary provided for in the \nnew constitutional dispensation.\n\nIn light of the encouraging developments in Kenya \nwith the adoption of the new Constitution, the reform \nof the judiciary and the holding of successful legislative \nand presidential elections, we believe it is very critical \nto support the peacebuilding and national reconciliation \nprocesses in the country. The recent decision of the \nICC in relation to the Kenyan situation is unhelpful and \nadversely affects the ability of the Kenyan leaders in \nthe discharge of their constitutional responsibilities. \nTherefore I would like to take this opportunity to once \nagain urge the Security Council to respond to our \nrequests.\n\nIn an increasingly globalized and multipolar world, \nAfrica obviously needs to forge multiple partnerships \nto realize its development aspirations and assume its \nrightful place in the international arena. It gives me great \nsatisfaction to note that Africa\u2019s strategic partnership \nwith both developed and emerging economies has \nexpanded and deepened in recent years. That is the path \nwe wish to pursue. Africa needs the solidarity of all \nsections of the international community, and it is our \nhope that all the necessary support will be extended \nto Africa in the spirit of the Millennium Declaration \n(resolution 55/2), which underlined so emphatically the \nspecial situation of Africa. That, in our view, should be \nthe spirit with which the deficit in the implementation \nof Millennium Development Goal 8 must be treated \nduring the very short time remaining.\n\nIn conclusion I wish to underline Africa\u2019s enduring \ncommitment to this indispensable global body \u2014 a \nuniversal organization whose viability is an existential \nnecessity. It is in that spirit that Africa will continue to \nnurture its close cooperation with the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, I wish to express my \ncongratulations to the President of the General Assembly \nupon his election to preside over the Assembly at its \nsixty-eighth session. I wish him the greatest of success \nin his task and in his efforts to promote the initiatives \nproposed for his term.\n\nI am here as a representative of the Dominican \nRepublic, which was one of the signatories in 1945 \nof the Charter of the United Nations, which entrusts \nthe Organization with the monumental task of saving \nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war. In the \n68 years since its inception, there has not been another \nworld war, but today we are facing a cataclysm that \nis just as lethal and destructive as a war of planetary \ndimensions: global poverty. It is a war with casualties \nin the millions, which calls for a radical change in \nthe economic paradigm and for the forging of a new \nculture \u2014 the culture of sustainability. As I address the \n\n\n\f\nAssembly, there is no doubt in my mind that to triumph \nover such a daunting challenge, all nations must make \ndifficult decisions, which will require the full weight of \nour collective responsibility.\n\nAllow me to refer to the extensive and detailed \ndocument adopted at the Rio de Janeiro United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) last \nyear (resolution 66/288, annex), entitled \u201cThe future \nwe want\u201d. In that text, Member States renewed their \ncommitment to sustainable development and to the \npromotion of a future that is sustainable in economic, \nsocial and environmental terms for our planet and for \npresent and future generations. That declaration shows \nthat the leaders of the world\u2019s nations are committed to \ndoing what is needed to attain that future. We therefore \nhave a road map with profound implications.\n\nLet us acknowledge that we are taking on \nan overwhelming responsibility, because we are \ncommitting ourselves to building a reality that is totally \nunprecedented in the modern world. Let us acknowledge \nthat development to date has not been sustainable in \nany way. It has not been sustainable either socially \nor economically. It has been even less sustainable in \nenvironmental terms. The systems of production that \nwe have used to achieve economic growth have been \nbased on methods that have proved to be harmful to \nthe environment, and the systems that we have used \nto distribute the wealth produced have created deep \nchasms of social inequality and exclusion.\n\nOver time, we have reached a situation that we now \nconsider to be intolerable: a world in which more than \n1 billion people are living in a state of extreme poverty \nand hunger; a world in which many millions of human \nbeings lack adequate health care, drinking water, good-\nquality education or decent employment; and a world in \nwhich extreme malnutrition and social exclusion prevail \nto a morally unacceptable extent. If we aspire to a world \nwhere development is sustainable, we must first accept \nour shared responsibility for all parts of all societies, \nand agree that it is time for actions, not words.\n\nTo translate a commitment of such a magnitude \ninto reality, it must be based on achievable actions and \nattainable goals, and we must be prepared to take bold \naction, as we are doing in the Dominican Republic, \non several unprecedented fronts. We are putting \ncitizens at the centre of our policies and making the \nfight against poverty and inequality our top priority. \nWe are implementing a new development model based \non a long-term national strategy built on the pillars of \nthree fundamental social pacts: a fiscal pact, a pact for \neducation and a pact for electricity. We are building \ntransparency into Government actions and establishing \ncitizens\u2019 groups to oversee and monitor purchasing and \ncontract systems. We are making support for small-\nscale agricultural producers a priority. We are doubling \nthe budget for free and compulsory public education. \nWe are extending the school day, and we are putting a \npermanent end to illiteracy.\n\nFollowing the commitments made at the Rio+20 \nConference, we have taken a few steps forward and \nare moving towards an agreement on a road map that \nwill lead us to sustainable development and to the \neradication of extreme poverty. We have implemented \na process to determine as accurately as possible what \nthe sustainable development goals for the post-2015 \ninternational development agenda should be.\n\nWe are pleased to note that we all agree that the \ngreatest challenge the world faces is to eradicate poverty \nand, for that reason, that goal has been given top priority \non the agenda of our people and our Organization.\n\nOur countries have common problems, but our \neconomic, social, historical, geographical, demographic \nand cultural realities are different. Each of those \ndimensions plays a role in how those problems may \nor may not be addressed and resolved. Moreover, our \nresponsibilities for the creation of or the aggravation of \nthose common problems, such as climate change, are \nclearly differentiated.\n\nMy country, the Dominican Republic, suffers \nthe consequences of climate change, because of its \ngeographical location in the path of annual hurricanes \nand tropical storms. For that reason, we are working \nto strengthen and improve our preparedness for the \nmanagement of risks associated with natural disasters. \nWe are building a collection centre for emergency \nassistance and are working on the creation of a centre \nof excellence, dedicated to the education and training \nof human resources for assistance in disasters, which \nwill serve the nations in the entire Caribbean region.\n\nNext month, from 18 to 20 November, the \nDominican Republic will host the third International \nConference on the HOPEFOR initiative, to which all \nMembers of the United Nations are cordially invited.\n\nUniversal sustainable development is a goal that \nrequires a new vision and approach on the international \nstage. In order for development to be sustainable in \nour nations, we must undertake structural reforms that \n\n\n\f\nwill change many of our policies and our economic and \nsocial systems, turning them inside out, the way a sock \nis turned inside out. With sustainable development, we \nhave taken on a commitment of biblical proportions, \na universal commitment to care for our brothers and \nsisters, especially for those who most need to be elevated \nto the conditions required for adignified human life.\n\nThe Organization is helping to point the way with \nthe launch of parallel processes of study, discussion \nand analysis; panels of eminent persons; consultations \nwith regional economic commissions; the Leadership \nCouncil of the Sustainable Development Solutions \nNetwork; and the open-ended working groups that are \ncontributing to marking the path.\n\nWe would therefore like to take the opportunity \nto express our appreciation for the work done by \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon in putting documents \nin the hands of Member States that will serve as a guide \nfor our debates and our decisions. One such document, \nAn Action Agenda for Sustainable Development, a \nreport prepared for the Secretary-General in June by \nthe Leadership Council of the Sustainable Development \nSolutions Network, is a bold and optimistic platform. \nIt is an exhaustive and practical plan that requires \na collective commitment that we cannot shirk. All \nreports agree that we cannot continue treating the part \nof the planet that each of our nations occupies as if the \nresources that nature has generously put within them \nwere inexhaustible. The world\u2019s forests, water supplies \nand mineral resources are decreasing, and animal \nspecies are endangered. At the same time, we continue \nto use methods of cultivation that poison or impoverish \nthe Earth and methods of industrial production that \npoison the air we breathe.\n\nWe must revise the very methods by which our \neconomic growth is driven. That is not a new concern \nfor the United Nations. We have been talking about \nsustainable development for decades. What is new now \nis that the situation has become a matter of urgency.\n\nThe time for words and promises is over. The time \nfor action is now. We must step up the pace to establish \nthe foundations of sustainable development, because \ntime is running out. We must address the purpose, \nknowing that what we do or do not agree upon in \nthis session of the General Assembly may determine \nwhether the future of our peoples, or rather, the future \nof humankind, will be promising or miserable. That \npresumption may seem exaggerated to representatives \nof larger or more highly developed nations. If so, we \ninvite those nations to look beyond their borders and \nto consider the peoples of the nations from which \nthey seek cheap labour. They must look at the peoples \nwhose human resources they employ to produce their \ngoods and services. They must look at the peoples in \nthe countries that need the industries of the developed \ncountries to process their mineral exports and at the \npeoples in the countries where they want to market \ntheir products.\n\nFor many of those people, the situation is intolerable. \nThat is why we are pleased to note that the documents \nthat have already been written and which are intended \nto serve as a platform for our debates and decisions \nhave an optimistic tone. They give us, for example, the \nassurance that if we act now, the problems we face will \nnot become insoluble.\n\nUniversal sustainable development, which \naddresses the challenges that have been so clearly \nidentified, will translate into social justice in the world. \nIt will also translate into peace, international peace, \nthe achievement of which is a strategic goal of the \nOrganization.\n\nTo speak of eradicating extreme poverty, measured \nin terms of living on an income of less than $1.25 a \nday, sounds like an enormous goal, especially because \nit is estimated that some 1.2 billion people in the world \nsuffer from poverty. In reality, that is just one step in \na long journey. If those who are now below the income \nlevel of $1.25 per day are elevated to an income level \nof $2 per day, we will have eliminated what we now \ncall extreme poverty. However, we all know that human \nbeings cannot meet their basic needs on an income of \n$2 per day. The difference in hardship between the one \nincome range and the other is not very noticeable. What \nhappens is that talking about poverty in statistical \nterms does not allow us to visualize, much less feel, the \nreality of the human misery and desolation behind the \nnumbers and the percentages. How can we understand \nthe pain of a father and mother who have suffered the \nloss of their child when the words in which we are \ninformed about that family tragedy are that every 10 \nseconds a child dies from hunger-related causes in the \nworld?\n\nLet us put ourselves in the place of parents of \nfamilies living in a state of extreme poverty. They \nhave to raise their children in extremely unsafe living \nconditions, without sanitation or safe drinking water, \nwithout sufficient resources to buy medicine or to \nprovide each child with food to ensure proper nutrition, \n\n\n\f\nwithout resources, without a bed or mosquito net to \nprotect him from insects that transmit serious diseases. \nThey have to decide which of their children can go to \nschool and which cannot, or which of their children \nhave to work and which do not.\n\nWe know that a difficult road still remains ahead \nbefore we can agree on a satisfactory arrangement for \nall in regard to the post-2015 international development \nagenda and the most effective ways to implement \nit. Let us remember that what we need is not a new \ncommitment. We have had many commitments to \neradicate extreme poverty and hunger. We have had the \nWorld Food Summit of 1996, the Millennium Summit \nin 2000, another World Food Summit five years later in \n2002, and the recent Rio+20 Conference in 2012. What \nwe need now is for those commitments to finally be \ntranslated into political action.\n\nAlthough sustainable development may sound \nlike an economic concept, it really is a political \nconcept. That is why we are discussing it here, at the \nOrganization, which is a forum of States and therefore a \npolitical forum. Economists measure the dimensions or \nthe pillars of reality in economic terms. Economists and \nother specialists can set the goals that must be reached \nfor a sustainable development that meets their exact \nspecifications. But political decisions are the driving \nforce. Political decisions are what ultimately determine \nwhether or not the goals are achieved.\n\nWe therefore have the primary responsibility. It \ndepends on us to put the declarations of good intentions \ninto action.\n"

        "file_text": "I am pleased to join previous \nspeakers in congratulating the President on his election \nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\neighth session. I thank our outgoing President for \nhis excellent leadership. Allow me also to extend my \nrespect and gratitude to the Secretary-General for his \nuntiring commitment to the mission and ideals of the \nUnited Nations.\n\nSince the United Nations Conference on \nEnvironment and Development, held in Rio de Janeiro \nin 1992, the international community has supported the \nprinciple that the best form of development is one that \nmeets the needs of the present without compromising \nthe ability of future generations to meet their needs. \nSince that time, however, production and consumption \npatterns have become increasingly unsustainable, \ndriven primarily by a desire to develop economies \nat any cost. The Federated States of Micronesia has \ntherefore proposed the following approach to global \ndevelopment beyond 2015. \n\nFirst, any post-2015 development agenda must \nmove beyond addressing basic human needs and \nfocus on sustainable development. Secondly, in order \nto ensure that sustainable development is carried out \nin a dynamic and inclusive manner, the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda must honour the environmental, \neconomic and social pillars that make up sustainable \ndevelopment. Finally, international cooperation \nand assistance are crucial to fostering sustainable \ndevelopment globally. The Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) have posed significant challenges. We \ncontinue to look to the international community for \n\n\n\f\nassistance to overcome those challenges as we develop \nthe sustainable development goals.\n\nAs this body considers a post-2015 development \nagenda, let us not forget one important point: \ndevelopment and the environment are inseparable. No \ncountry can develop its economy without degrading its \nnatural environment to some significant degree. While \nsociety strives for economic progress, the natural \nenvironment that sustained our ancestors through \nthousands of years has come under attack.\n\nClimate change is, without question, the gravest \nthreat to my people\u2019s welfare, livelihood and general \nsecurity. It is the survival issue of our time. Our \nsustainable development is threatened by the harmful \neffects of excessive greenhouse gas emissions in the \natmosphere, the effects of which poison our root crops, \ndestroy our reef systems and drive many of our people \nfrom their ancestral homes. All of us, developed and \ndeveloping countries alike, have a stake in finding ways \nthat minimize man-made damage to Mother Earth.\n\nOnly the international community can effectively \ntake up that cause. To that end, the comprehensive \nclimate change treaty planned for adoption in 2015 \nmust impose legally binding commitments. These \ncommitments must reflect a level of ambition far higher \nthan under the second commitment period of the Kyoto \nProtocol. Pre-2020 mitigation action must also be \nambitious enough to close the emissions gap.\n\nI reiterate the hope that the world will address \nthe dangerous growth of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) \nby phasing down those chemicals under the Montreal \nProtocol. Micronesia was the first to submit an \ninnovative proposal in this regard. We welcome the \nnewly announced agreement between China and the \nUnited States to phase down HFCs. We also welcome \nsimilar developments around the globe. Achieving \na phase-down of HFCs under the Protocol will build \nconfidence and momentum for significant action on \nclimate change in the future. \n\nAnother notable contribution is the Majuro \nDeclaration for Climate Leaderhip, under which every \nPacific Island Forum leader pledged to strengthen their \ncountry\u2019s efforts to fight climate change.\n\nAs we move towards the post-2015 development \nagenda, let us not lose sight of the enormous importance \nof the world\u2019s oceans. We call for the establishment of \na sustainable development goal on healthy, productive \nand resilient oceans. In turn, we should expect a greater \nshare of the benefits from the world\u2019s oceans. Let me \nstress the central role that the effective management \nof all fisheries must play in sustainable management. \nBycatch and, particularly, discarded bycatch threaten \neffective fisheries management. This is a serious \nconservation problem, because valuable living \nresources are wasted. Moreover, it threatens our food \nsecurity and nutrition needs.\n\nSimilarly, we agree that it is essential to include \nthe goal of sustainable energy for all in the sustainable \ndevelopment goals that are under discussion here \nin New York. The transition to sustainable energy \nplaces a huge fiscal burden on our national accounts. I \ncommend Tonga for spearheading the Pacific Regional \nData Repository for Sustainable Energy for All.\n\nThe Federated States of Micronesia looks to the \ninternational community for economic cooperation and \nsupport. With limited resources, we have undertaken \nsome bold initiatives.\n\nFirst, we operate under a nationwide integrated \ndisaster risk management and climate change policy \nthat mainstreams climate change into our primary \ngovernmental and economic decision-making \nprocesses. This policy places special emphasis on \nstrengthening the application of traditional knowledge \nof ancient conservation practices, which are threatened \nby sea-level rise, ocean acidification and other effects of \nexcess global greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, \nour legislative branch recently ratified the Doha \nAmendment to the Kyoto Protocol. We will soon submit \nthe instrument of ratification.\n\nSecondly, we have taken significant steps in \nconserving our limited land and fragile marine \necosystems through the Micronesia Challenge. We \nhave undertaken this Challenge because our nation is \nmade of many small low-lying atolls. Our people are \nwise stewards of our land and sea, working with the \nenvironment to provide sustenance for us all. As the \npreamble to our Constitution says, \n\n\u201cThe seas bring us together, they do not \nseparate us, our islands sustain us, our island nation \nenlarges us and makes us stronger... Our ancestors \nwho made their homes on these islands displaced \nno other people. We, who remain, wish no other \nhome than this.\u201d \nThirdly, we recently adopted a national policy \nthat aims to ensure a sustainable energy supply and \n\n\n\f\nan environmentally sound energy policy. Historically, \nMicronesia has imported all of its energy in the form of \nfossil fuels. We have begun to reduce our dependence \non fossil fuels. There are already a number of renewable \nenergy projects up and running in many parts of my \ncountry, thanks to the assistance of our generous \ndevelopment partners. My country has adopted very \nambitious targets in this regard.\n\nIn order to continue implementing our national \ndevelopment policies, we call on the major donor States \nto honour their official development assistance (ODA) \ntarget of seven tenths of a per cent of gross national \nincome by 2015. We look forward to the discussion \nin the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts \non Sustainable Development Financing. Technical \nassistance as a component of ODA is also crucial, \nparticularly in the form of appropriate technology \ntransfers and capacity-building initiatives.\n\nSustainable development must be supported by all \nof its pillars \u2014 not just economic and environmental \nconcerns, but also social considerations. Our people are \nour most valuable assets. Therefore, we are tailoring an \napproach that is inclusive of all our people, with special \nattention to the circumstances of our women, youth, the \nelderly and disabled persons. Their advancement must \nbe mainstreamed into our discussion on a post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda.\n\nNon-communicable diseases such as diabetes and \nheart and kidney diseases continue to be a challenge. \nWe must address them through the sustainable \ndevelopment goals. This is a global crisis, demanding \na global solution. If not controlled, it could undermine \nsustainable development and degrade the quality of life \nof our people.\n\nWe welcome the High-level Meeting on Disability \nand Development (A/68/PV.3) that took place two \ndays ago. I was impressed by the achievements of \nthe speakers and their inspirational leadership in this \nforum. We support the outcome document (resolution \n68/3) of the High-level Meeting.\n\nThe Federated States of Micronesia places a high \npriority on the harnessing of advanced information and \ncommunication technologies for our socioeconomic \ndevelopment, especially in the areas of distance \neducation, health, and natural disaster early warning. \nWe thank the World Bank and the Asian Development \nBank for the assistance that they have offered to improve \nour telecommunications and to enable our country to \nobtain fibre optics. We also welcome cooperation and \nsupport from the International Telecommunication \nUnion and our development partners.\n\nHuman trafficking continues to be a serious crime, \naffecting all nations and causing untold human misery \nand economic harm. My country is striving to protect \nits population from this scourge. We support the efforts \nof the United Nations to stop human trafficking, and \nwe hope to implement the United Nations Blue Heart \nCampaign against Human Trafficking in all forms in \nMicronesia. The ongoing tragedy caused by human \ntrafficking demands that it be prioritized and addressed \nby the entire international community.\n\nThe global development agenda will be shaped by \nthe launching of the sustainable development goals \nin 2015. Many processes will influence the selection \nand monitoring of those goals, including the work of \nthe Commission on Sustainable Development, which \nhas now been replaced by the high-level political \nforum. I cannot over-emphasize the importance of \nthe new forum, which will take on the monitoring \nof the implementation of sustainable development \ncommitments. These are outlined in the Barbados \nProgram of Action, the Mauritius Strategy and the \noutcome document of the United Nations Conference \non Sustainable Development (resolution 66/288).\n\nThe second event that will shape the sustainable \ndevelopment agenda is the comprehensive climate \nchange treaty, whose adoption is planned for 2015, and \nfor which we support ambitious, binding commitments. \nThirdly, preparations for the Third United Nations \nConference on Small Island Developing States, to be \nheld in September 2014 in Apia, Samoa, are now under \nway. Micronesia and other small island developing \nStates recognize the international community\u2019s \ngoodwill and renewed willingness to help our countries \naddress our priorities and challenges.\n\nFourthly, I would also like to commend the \nSecretary-General for his vision and support of the wide \nrange of issues so critical to small island developing \nStates. His advocacy for next year\u2019s high-level summit \non climate change and his focus on climate change \nthemes will generate the political momentum for a post-\n2015 development agenda to guide all stakeholders.\n\nWe recognize the central role that reliable data \nplays in government planning and the crucial need \nfor capacity-building, which must keep pace with \nthe changing dynamics of basic governance in the \n\n\n\f\ninternational landscape. The remoteness of our \nislands, limited national capacities, and the complex \nrequirements of the United Nations make our \ndevelopment efforts even more difficult and expensive. \nWe therefore look to the specialized United Nations \nagencies for urgent assistance.\n\n\nIn closing, let me express my sympathy and \nsolidarity with those people around the world who \nare facing immediate threats to their survival. I am \nhorrified by the killing of innocents, especially women \nand children, in Syria and elsewhere. We in our peaceful \nislands condemn violence. But what can a small island \nnation in the Pacific do? What can any country, large \nor small, do? The answer, we believe, can be found \nonly within our Organization. The world in which we \nlive is too interdependent for us to stand aside while \ngenerations of internal conflict harden into unending \nhatred and bloodshed. We are all stakeholders. We must \nput an end to the senseless killings around the world. \nI call upon this Organization to employ its collective \nwill to pursue the ideals of our Charter. I know in my \nheart that the goal is achievable. The future we want is \nenduring peace and prosperity for our world.\n"

        "file_text": "I wish to start by extending our \nsincere congratulations to Mr. John Ashe on his \nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \nat its sixty-eighth session. \n\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, we had \nevery reason to be optimistic about the future. With the \nend of the Cold War, the moral balance of the world \nshifted towards the pursuit of peace. A lasting peace \nis far more than the mere absence of war. We, the \ninternational community, understood the imperative of \nworking together for a stable world order. We maintain \nour strong commitment to the universal principles of \nthe United Nations system and, in a spirit of solidarity \nand cooperation, we develop effective international \nresponses to the scourge of terrorism. \n\nYet the most profound crises of our times have \nbeen emerging from internal conflicts. Such conflicts \nhave been increasing in both frequency and magnitude. \nThey are largely driven by the problem of political \nlegitimacy, which leads the governed to withhold their \nconsent and limits the prospects for domestic order. \nLeaders without political legitimacy share a common \ndelusion. Instead of reading the future and leading \ntransformation, they believe that they can buy time \nwith irresponsible actions against their own people. \nEventually, those domestic conflicts escalate into civil \nwars, such as the tragedy we are witnessing in Syria. \nThe actions of those leaders have implications for peace \nand security beyond their own borders. If some leaders \ninsist on defining their security in a way that inflicts \ninsecurity upon other nations there can be no collective \nsecurity. \n\nToday regional and international peace and security \ndepend upon the maintenance of domestic order in each \n\n\n\f\nindividual nation. True domestic peace is the key to \nregional and international peace and stability That is \na challenge that we will continue to face in the years \nahead.\n\nWe all know that no one holds a monopoly on \nrighteousness, yet I would like to touch upon the \nfunction of the whole United Nations system. We all \nneed a strong, efficient and credible United Nations. We \nneed a United Nations fit for its purpose in confronting \ncurrent global realities. The United Nations of which \nI speak should be a body capable of taking action to \nmaintain international peace and security. It should \nbe able to safeguard security, justice and the people\u2019s \nfundamental rights and freedoms. It should never forfeit \nits prime responsibility for the sake of power politics.\n\nWe must realize that inaction by the Security \nCouncil only emboldens aggressive regimes. We need \na United Nations capable of forcing the perpetrators of \nbrutal actions to submit to justice and the rule of law. \nOnly through such a United Nations can we achieve the \ntruly peaceful world envisioned by the Organization\u2019s \nfounders. Yet as much as that remains a noble goal, it is \nalso an urgent necessity. Decisive action is the only way \nthat the United Nations system will remain relevant and \ncredible. To face that new reality, we need a Security \nCouncil that is truly democratic, representative, \neffective and accountable.\n\nNo issue facing us is more pressing than the \nsituation in Syria. Let me be clear. Turkey welcomes and \nfirmly supports the United States-Russian agreement \nto eliminate Syria\u2019s arsenal of chemical weapons. That \nagreement has to be translated into a tangible Security \nCouncil resolution. When Syria comes clean about its \narsenal, once and for all, it will be a relief for the Syrian \npeople and the region. As Syria\u2019s neighbour, Turkey will \nappreciate more than most the complete and verifiable \ndestruction of those weapons.\n\nNevertheless, we cannot forget that chemical \nweapons were used against Syrian civilians only a \nmonth ago. The perpetrators of that crime against \nhumanity must be held accountable and be brought to \njustice. I also see the agreement on Syrian chemical \nweapons as an opportunity. I hope it will be a first step \nin the formation of a security architecture to ensure the \nelimination of all weapons of mass destruction in the \nMiddle East.\n\nYet the recent approach to the situation in Syria \nalso raises difficult questions. Were it not for the use of \nchemical weapons, would the international community \nhave continued to turn a blind eye to the deaths of more \nthan 100,000 people? For how long can we afford to \nevade our moral responsibility to the people being \nkilled even as we speak here? The conflict neither \nbegan with the use of chemical weapons nor will it \nend with an agreement to eliminate them. We therefore \nbluntly reject any position that is not troubled by the \nkilling of innocent people in itself, but only by the \nmeans of such killing. Such an approach is immoral and \ntotally unacceptable. The agreement to destroy Syria\u2019s \nchemical arsenal must not allow the regime to avoid \nresponsibility for its other crimes.\n\nSyria, a great country and a great nation, is \nconsuming itself. It is a disgrace that the Security \nCouncil has failed to uphold its primary responsibility \nin that case. It is deeply regrettable that political \ndifferences, balance-of-power politics and geopolitical \nconsiderations have prevailed over the imperative \nto end the tragedy. Staying on this course cannot be \nan option. When the tragedy began, we spoke of the \nkilling of hundreds of people, then thousands, then \ntens of thousands, and now we speak of over a hundred \nthousand deaths. If we cannot stop the conflict now, \nrest assured that we will be talking about twice that \nnumber next year. \n\nI cannot emphasize this enough. Agreement on \nchemical weapons must not be allowed to substitute \nfor a comprehensive political strategy to address the \nsituation in Syria. The conflict has evolved into a real \nthreat to regional peace and security. Any recurrence \nof the proxy wars of the Cold War era will plunge Syria \ninto further chaos.\n\nThe continuation of the refugee crisis will pose \nvital social, political and economic risks for the host \nnations, as we have learned bitterly on many occasions. \nWe know that civil wars are among the most brutal. We \nalso know how they foster radicalism and extremism. \nOnce extremist groups take root in a State, they form \nautonomous structures and become a real threat to \nsecurity, not only at home but also abroad. In the end, \ndissolving such organizations presents the greatest \nchallenge to restoring security in a country.\n\nWe must be aware of the threat and realize that with \neach day we lose in indecision, the more remote the \nprospects for a peaceful Syria become. After the Syrian \npeople took to the streets against the regime, many \ninternational statements were made to support their \ncause, strong in their wording and promises. Those \n\n\n\f\napparent commitments raised the hopes of the Syrian \npeople. Yet many nations remained at a comfortable \ndistance, disturbed only by the horrible images from \nSyria. Meanwhile, the Syrian people\u2019s cries for help \nwent unheeded. What could match the Syrian people\u2019s \ndisappointment as they suffered the worst massacre of \nthe twenty-first century as the international community \nsimply looked on.\n\nThat brings me to the question of what needs to \nbe done. There has to be a sound strategy with well-\ndefined and well-calculated objectives for a peaceful \nsolution. It has to aim to end Syria\u2019s civil war, ensuring \nthe immediate safety and security of the Syrian people \nand the country\u2019s stable transition. The enforcement of \nsuch a strategy requires a fully determined, committed \nand robust international engagement \u2014 exactly what \nhas been missing since the beginning of the conflict. \n\nIn short, we cannot and shall not leave the Syrian \npeople to their fate. The burden of ending Syria\u2019s \nplight now rests on the shoulders of the international \ncommunity. Strong words of support must now be \nmatched by real deeds. We must be relentless in our \nsearch for a new, stable, intact and secure Syria, at \npeace with its people and its neighbours. To that end, \nwe must devise and enforce a political strategy led by \nthe Permanent Five and the neighbouring countries.\n\nFor the last three years, the Middle East has been \nexperiencing a remarkable era of social and political \nchange. The process of transformation begun in 2010 \nmarks the end of the century-old, region-wide status \nquo. Of course, there have been and will be waves \nof reaction against the changes. Nevertheless, the \nadvances in the region, including in Tunisia, Libya and \nEgypt, are irreversible. \n\nArab peoples are equally capable of building \npluralistic societies. Yet we should not expect the newly \nemerging political systems to transform into mature \ndemocracies overnight. It is only through slow but \nsteady democratic processes that societies will come to \nunderstand the value of conciliation. The noble cause \nof the Arab peoples deserves our full and unhesitating \nsupport.\n\nThe continuation of the Palestinian question for \nmore than half a century has inflicted colossal damage \non the very concept of justice. The denial of the right \nof the Palestinians to have a State of their own has no \njustification on any moral, political or legal ground. \nDespite insistent calls of the international community, \nthe continued expansion of the illegal settlements on \nPalestinian land undermines the prospects for a two-\nState solution. \n\nThe case for peace is self-evident. We therefore \nwelcome and strongly support the talks initiated \nbetween the parties under the auspices of the United \nStates. The success of future efforts mainly depends \non the Israeli Government\u2019s acceptance of the \nestablishment of a viable, contiguous Palestinian State. \nThere is also a need for the presence of a reconciled and \nunified Palestinian front.\n\nThat brings us to another issue upon which our \ncredibility rests \u2014 the question of Cyprus. Repeated \nattempts towards a peaceful settlement have ended in \nfailure, including the rejection of the Annan plan in \n2004. Turkey, as a guarantor, is fully and sincerely \ncommitted to finding a just and negotiated settlement. \nWe therefore expect the international community to \nurge the Greek Cypriots to reciprocate by engaging in \nresult-oriented, time-framed negotiations in good faith. \nThose who must solve this question are the Turks and \nGreeks of Cyprus. They must start negotiating as soon \nas next month, with no ifs or buts. The settlement of the \nCyprus question is essential to a stable and peaceful \neastern Mediterranean.\n\nFrozen conflicts hinder effective regional \ncooperation. We strongly urge peaceful resolution \nof the Nagorno Karabakh conflict and achieving \nsustainable peace in the Caucasus, based on territorial \nintegrity. We have proposed a comprehensive strategy \nfor regional economic cooperation and development, \ncombined with gradual withdrawal from the occupied \nterritories. We believe that can serve as a solid basis for \nregional peace.\n\nAnother area where regional cooperation is in high \ndemand is the Balkans. In the last few years, Turkey has \nbolstered its efforts to build strong ties with all Balkan \nnations. Our objective is to create an atmosphere of \ndialogue, trust, mutual understanding and conciliation. \n\nWe also have a dependable interest in a secure, \nprosperous and peaceful Afghanistan. Here, too, \nregional cooperation and ownership is a must. For that \nreason, I have personally initiated and led the efforts \nto establish the Trilateral Summit process among \nAfghanistan, Pakistan and Turkey. Since 2007, it has \nproven a real success, and I am confident that more \nsuccess will follow.\n\n\n\f\nAnother important issue that affects us all is \nterrorism. It is real, extremely dangerous, and a crime \nagainst humanity, and it must be defeated. We can defeat \nit only when we get rid of \u201cmy terrorist/your terrorist\u201d \ndistinctions. Effective international partnership against \nterrorism remains a key priority for Turkey.\n\nThere is yet another issue that needs our attention. \nUnfortunately, Islamophobia has become a new form of \nracism. It aims to create an abstract, imaginary enemy \nfrom the millions of peace-loving Muslims all over \nthe world. It is essential to strike a balance between \nprotecting freedom of expression and preserving \nrespect for faiths.\n\nThe current challenges of development are \nmatters of global concern. Turkey is now runing \na comprehensive assistance and direct investment \npackage for the world\u2019s least developed countries. \nHumanitarian diplomacy is a key objective of Turkish \nforeign policy. In fact, Turkey became the fourth-\nlargest donor last year. Including the contributions of \nTurkish non-governmental organizations in the fields \nof health, education, and capacity-building, Turkey\u2019s \nhumanitarian assistance totals $2 billion per year. Our \nengagement in Somalia is an exemplary case. We have \nallocated $300 million so far.\n\nOur approach to Africa is one of equal partnership \nand is best captured in the African proverb which \nstates, \u201cIf you want to go fast, go alone. But if you want \nto go far, go together.\u201d For Turkey, relations with Africa \nremain a key priority.\n\nTurkey is a candidate for a non-permanent seat \non the Security Council for the term 2015-2016. If \nelected, Turkey will bring an independent voice to \nthe Security Council, one that listens to all and tries \nto find comprehensive and lasting solutions through \ndialogue. We expect the support of all Members for our \ncandidacy. \n\nI believe that the new millennium is one in which \ndemocracy, rule of law, respect for human rights and \nglobal welfare will continue to expand. I believe that an \ninternational peace shaped by freedom, justice, dignity, \nsocial progress and economic welfare is within our \nreach. We must join our strength to build an enduring \ninternational order that is worthy of the principles of \nthe Charter of the United Nations. A stable, secure, and \nprosperous world is the best way to secure and advance \nall of our interests. Achieving such a world remains our \nfundamental responsibility to our nations.\n"

        "file_text": "At the outset, let me \nextend my congratulations and appreciation to the \nPresident of the General Assembly for his leadership \nand work with the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth \nsession and to the Secretary-General for his continuing \nleadership.\n\nThe Palauan flag depicts a yellow full moon against \na blue ocean. That combination of moon and ocean is a \nmetaphor for nature\u2019s balance and harmony through the \nconsistency of the rising and falling tides. Just before \nI left to come to the General Assembly, during a full \nmoon high tide, my back yard, which nestles against \nthe ocean, flooded. Typhoon Usagi passed through the \nPacific just a few days later and landed in Asia, killing \nmany people. It was followed almost immediately by \nTropical Storm Pabuk.\n\nWhen I was a child, my back yard did not flood \nand we did not have tropical storm after tropical storm \npass through our Pacific islands. It is therefore as clear \nto me as it is to other Pacific leaders that the full moon \nand the ocean are no longer metaphors for balance and \nharmony. Today they represent imbalance from our \npast excesses and a lack of harmony due to our current \ninability, as the Secretary-General has so often said, to \ncreate the world we want.\n\nThe leaders and the people of the world certainly \nface many challenges moving forward in creating the \nworld we want and in developing a sustainable future. \nIn addressing the next round of sustainable development \ngoals and in responding to the ever-growing challenges \n\n\n\f\nof global warming, it is imperative that we all do a better \njob of working together to solve the serious issues that \nwe face.\n\nWorld leaders at the 1992 Earth Summit in \nRio established a positive and rational vision of \npartnership and sustainable development for the \nworld. Unfortunately, that vision seems to have been \nsidetracked. There is therefore frustration in many \ncountries today related to our failure to move that vision \nforward, the slow pace in progress in meeting our joint \ngoals, and the fear that those goals are being diluted.\n\nToday, it appears that the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change has stalled, that the \nKyoto Protocol is on life support, and that the United \nNations Conference on Sustainable Development \nhas not done enough to strengthen our three pillars \nof sustainable development. Our job as leaders is to \nreinvigorate our efforts by establishing real mitigation \ncommitments and identifying immediate, sufficient \nand long-term implementation financing.\n\nTogether, we reaffirmed the principle of common \nbut differentiated responsibilities at Rio and moved \nforward with the green economy approach to \nsustainable development issues. We must not allow our \ngreen economy to become business as usual. Rather, \nwe must take concrete actions to make real our stated \nreaffirmation of the principles of the Monterrey \nConsensus and the Doha Declaration on Financing \nfor Development. Only then will our sustainable \ndevelopment goals discussed at this session of the \nGenerally Assembly have a real chance to respond to our \ncurrent worldwide environmental and developmental \nemergency. \n\nIt is clear that what is needed today is \nleadership \u2014 leadership from the developed world and \nleadership from the developing world; leadership that \nfocuses beyond borders and looks farther than today\u2019s \nproblems; ultimately, leadership that creates a broad \nconsensus vision to preserve our planet for tomorrow\u2019s \nchildren. Such leadership must be based upon concrete \nand clear principles that will help guide all of our \nactions.\n\nFirst, all nations, large and small, must accept \ndirect and primary responsibility for global issues that \nthreaten our planetary future, and must immediately \ntake appropriate action. Secondly, we must protect \nthe natural resources of all people and all nations, \nand recognize that no nation has the right to pollute \nthe resources of another. Thirdly, we must recognize \nthe need for the richer nations of the world to actively \naddress actions that threaten the poorer nations of the \nworld. Fourthly, we must protect human resources \nthrough governing strategies that focus on broad-based \neducation, health, jobs and equal opportunities, and \nthat acknowledge cultures, traditions and homelands. \nFinally, we must agree, in all matters, to promote and \nprotect the human rights and peaceful existence of all \nthe people of the world. Discussion, not weapons, is \nthe best way to resolve differences and uphold human \nrights.\n\nLet me interject here that as we witness so many \nareas of conflict on our planet, I think it is time for all of \nus, as leaders, to use this great institution and our own \nefforts to condemn violence against people, including \nthe use of chemical weapons, for any reason, and to \nseek an end to armed conflict wherever we can. The \nevents in Kenya are but one of a series of violent acts \nagainst people that we must work together to eliminate.\n\nOur global warming doomsday is already set \nin stone if we fail to act. It is therefore our job as \nleaders to take all necessary action to eliminate the \ncurrent threat. My country, along with other Pacific \nisland nations, is unwilling even to discuss a 3\u00b0C-to-\n5\u00b0C temperature-increase scenario by the end of the \ncentury, for that will ensure our demise. We are also \nunwilling to discuss the issue of migration. Instead, we \nwill continue to work with our developed partners to \nimplement strong mitigation commitments and follow-\nthrough action to hold the line on that increase to a \nmore realistic 1.5\u00b0C level.\n\nMy small Pacific country supports the concepts \ninherent in the Majuro Declaration for Climate \nLeadership, issued at the Pacific Island Forum this year. \nThe Declaration acknowledges the gross insufficiency \nof current efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. \nIt also recognizes the necessity of ramping up climate \nchange responses immediately and provides a platform \nfor country leaders to establish new and realistic \nreduction commitments. As leaders, we must all \nrespond to global warming in both the short and long \nterm, from the top down and the bottom up, both pre-\n2020 and post-2020.\n\nWe should not forget, however, that the primary \nresponsibility for reducing greenhouse gases still rests \nwith our developed partners. We must therefore use \nthe opportunity of the nineteenth session of the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \n\n\n\f\nto be held in Warsaw, and thereafter, to support the \ntechnical work needed to fast-track the policies and \ntechnologies appropriate to accomplishing our goal; to \nrevive the Kyoto Protocol or develop a more responsive \nalternative, and deliver and expand on commitments \nto reduce greenhouse gases; to phase out inefficient \nfossil-fuel subsidies that distort world oil prices; and \nto arrive at a legally binding agreement to respond to \nand compensate for loss and damage associated with \nthe impact of climate change in vulnerable countries.\n\nHere at the United Nations in New York, we must \ndeal with global warming security issues by appointing \na special representative on climate and security to help \nexpand our understanding of the security dimensions of \nclimate change, and by establishing a joint task force, \nled by the Secretary-General, to assess and expand \nUnited Nations capacity to respond to the security \nimplications of climate change. We must make 2014 \nthe year of ambition. As host of the forty-fifth Pacific \nIslands Forum, Palau pledges to use that summit to \nbuild on the Majuro Declaration and to drive greater \naction. As leaders, we must also come to the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s climate change summit next year ready to \ndiscuss the new mitigation actions we are prepared to \ntake and the plans necessary to see that they are fully \nimplemented.\n\nMy country is trying with all its might to embrace \nits leadership on issues of sustainable development. To \ndate, Palau has committed to providing 20 per cent of \nits energy through renewable sources by 2020 and to \nreducing energy consumption through efficiency and \nconservation efforts. We have also declared and begun \nto implement the Micronesia Challenge, which commits \nthe Micronesian region to effectively conserving at least \n30 per cent of near-shore marine resources and 20 per \ncent of terrestrial resources by 2020. In that effort, Palau \nand other Micronesian jurisdictions have strengthened \nor established more than 150 protected and managed \nareas covering more than 680,000 hectares, leveraged \nmore than $20 million in operational funds and inspired \nother efforts, such as the Caribbean Challenge, the \nCoral Triangle initiative and the Western Indian Ocean \nCoastal Challenge.\n\nIn addition, we have recently sponsored the \ncreation of a Pacific Islands Forum invasive species \nadvisory group to improve regional efforts to reduce \nthe expansion of invasive species throughout the \nPacific. Palau has also pioneered the planet\u2019s first shark \nsanctuary and, finally, recently engaged to pursue our \nmost ambitious commitment to date \u2014 establishing \nthe world\u2019s first comprehensive marine sanctuary, \nwhich will close Palau\u2019s exclusive economic zone to \ncommercial fishing. We ask all the nations of the world \nto move in a similar direction, while recognizing their \nown unique circumstances, to help protect our planet\u2019s \nnatural resources. An example of one simple action \nthat would have a major impact on saving our shark \npopulation would be the prohibition of shark\u2019s fin soup. \nThat is something that everyone in the world can clearly \ndo without.\n\nWe are at a historic global moment. A year from \nnow, the United Nations will launch the sustainable \ndevelopment goals, in a framework that will define \nthe relationship between our peoples and our planet \nfor generations to come. Through those goals, we must \ncommit to a more sustainable use of the oceans. They \ncover two-thirds of the world\u2019s surface and connect \n90 per cent of its population. A billion people are \ndependent on their fish. The oceans\u2019 health is undeniably \nlinked to our culture, societies and economies. Yet \nin the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the \noceans received no mention. As the MDGs wind down \nin 2015, we need a new paradigm.\n\nIt is therefore time to enunciate our commitment \nto our oceans with a sustainable development goal that \ndeals exclusively with them. Drawing from the lessons \nlearned from the MDGs, we as leaders must create a goal \nthat is resonant, measurable and easily communicated. \nFailure to do so will leave us naked before the shifting \ntides. In our sustainable development goals, we must \nalso focus on non-communicable diseases (NCDs), \nwhich cause two-thirds of the world\u2019s 57 million deaths \nannually. Within that context, we should also recognize \nthat tobacco consumption, which was not included in \nthe MDGs, has a direct impact on worsening NCDs and \nmust therefore be separately targeted.\n\nNone of our leadership goals can be achieved \nwithout strong partnerships. Fortunately, Palau has \nbeen blessed over the last half-century with strong \nregional and international partners. I would first like \nto acknowledge the more than 50 years of support and \nleadership shown to us by the United States. We stand \nwith the United States in its ongoing efforts to guide the \ninternational response to the horrific actions in Syria. \nWe are also grateful for its very generous economic \nsupport over the years, and for being a reliable ally on \nwhich we can depend. We look forward to the final \n\n\n\f\ncompletion of the treaty that will renew and reinforce \nour relationship.\n\nPalau would also like to acknowledge the significant \nsupport we have received over the years from our friend \nJapan. We are hopeful that expansion and reform of the \nSecurity Council will result in permanent membership \nof the Council for Japan. In addition, we would like \nto thank the Republic of China on Taiwan for its \nfriendship and economic support in helping Palau to \nachieve its Millennium Development Goals and move \non to the post-2015 development agenda through grants \nand technical assistance in the areas of infrastructure, \nfood security enhancement and human capacity. We \nstrongly support Taiwan\u2019s expanded participation in \nthe United Nations system, acknowledge the expansion \nof its meaningful participation in United Nations \nspecialized agencies and mechanisms, and call on the \nUnited Nations system to accept Taiwan\u2019s participation \nas a valuable contributor to our collective efforts.\n\nBeginning with the leadership of those assembled \nhere, and working down to every level of international \naction and cooperation, we can respond, in a timely and \nexpedited fashion, to the real emergencies we face. But \nthe time for excuses is over. It is now time for leaders \nto lead.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a distinct honour for me to address this forum. \nI would like to extend my sincere congratulations to \nMr. John Ashe on his assumption of the presidency of \nthe General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I am \ncertain that under his leadership, the Assembly will \nsuccessfully define the post-2015 development agenda \nat this session. I would also like to express my deepest \nrespect to the Secretary-General for his significant \ncontributions to the continuing work of the United \nNations.\n\nOver the past 100 years, the miraculous advances \nof science and technology have changed our world \nprofoundly, making it appear smaller. People\u2019s lives \nhave improved. Yet along with those accomplishments \nhave come latent dangers. The long-standing dream \nshared by people across the world of living a safe, \npeaceful, prosperous and happy life free from hunger \nremains far from achieved.\n\nHumankind yearns for peace, so why is it that \nmany regions remain under the constant threat of \ndisputes, conflicts and wars? The global economy is \ngrowing, so how is it that billions of people still live in \nabject poverty? Science and technology have brought \nabout outstanding advancement, so why have natural \ndisasters, epidemics and pollution become increasingly \nsevere and unpredictable? Those questions impose an \nenormous responsibility on all of us, as the community \nof nations.\n\nThroughout history, wars have destroyed many \ncivilizations. In only the past 100 years, two world \nwars and many others \u2014 including that in Viet \nNam \u2014 have cost millions of lives and produced \ndevastating consequences over generations. While \npeace, cooperation and development are the dominant \ntrend, the threat of war is ever present. \n\nViolence in the Middle East and North Africa is of \ngrave concern. The latest instance in Syria, involving \nthe use of chemical weapons, needs to be strongly \ncondemned. We must give peace every possible chance \nand find solutions to eliminate chemical weapons, in \naccordance with international law and United Nations \nresolutions. \n\nUnpredictable developments in the Korean \npeninsula persist. Territorial disputes still rage in the \nEast China Sea and South China Sea. Just one single \nincident or ill-conceived act could trigger conflict, or \neven war.\n\nIn the East China Sea, through which over half \nof the world\u2019s shipping passes, maintaining maritime \nsecurity and freedom of navigation is critical, not only \nto the region but to the world. Viet Nam consistently \npursues a policy of peaceful resolution of disputes to \ndefend its legitimate interests and fully respect those of \nthe global community, in accordance with international \nlaw, the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law \nof the Sea, the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties \nin the South China Sea, other regional agreements, and \nefforts to elaborate a code of conduct.\n\nHo Chi Minh used the words of Thomas Jefferson \nin Viet Nam\u2019s Declaration of Independence:\n\n\n\f\n\u201cAll men are created equal. They are endowed \nby their Creator with certain inalienable rights; \namong these are life, liberty and the pursuit of \nhappiness\u201d. \nAll human life is precious, irrespective of race, religion \nor gender. Taking a single life causes heart-breaking \npain to any family, be it here in Manhattan or far away \nin a remote corner of the Earth. Therefore, any effort \nto prevent conflict must be valued and supported. Any \neffort to preserve peace must be fully exhausted. Any \nact to provoke war must be condemned and stopped. A \nphysician must do whatever is possible to cure a patient \nif there is but a glimpse of life left. And we must devote \nall of our efforts to preserving peace if there is but a \nfeeble sign that war can be averted, for war will take the \nlife of not only one, but many people, including many \nwomen and children.\nPeace can be built and preserved only when \nall countries respect each other\u2019s independence, \nsovereignty and cultural traditions, without imposing \none\u2019s own morality on another. Conflict and war can be \naverted only if we eliminate actions that run counter to \nthe Charter of the United Nations and international law, \ndominance and power politics. \n\nStrategic trust among nations must be constantly \nnurtured with honesty, sincerity and concrete actions. \nIn the lifting of the embargo against Cuba or the \nrecognition of the right of the Palestinian people to \nself-determination, for example, the role of the United \nNations and the Security Council should be promoted. \nThe international community expects the major Powers \nto set an example for others in peacebuilding. The \nSecurity Council should be the fulcrum in building \nconsensus for driving all nations to join hands in \npreserving peace. The deadly hand of war, conflict, \nterrorism and violence lies in wait to take the lives \nof hundreds, thousands or even millions of innocent \npeople. Let us not offer war a hand or look away. Let \nus stop it.\n\nI share the Secretary-General\u2019s view that the \nMillennium Development Goals are our most successful \nendeavour against hunger and poverty to date, but let us \nnot forget that close to 40 per cent of global wealth rests \nin the hands of no more than 1 per cent of the world\u2019s \npopulation. The gap between rich and poor continues \nto widen. Over 1 billion people still live in extreme \npoverty. Hundreds of millions of people, especially \nchildren, continue to be hungry and food insecure, \nill and without basic medicines, and they face a grim \nfuture due to the lack of educational opportunities.\n\nAt the same time, deforestation, exhaustive \nexploitation of natural resources, pollution and other \nfactors have led to global warming, rising sea levels, \nunpredictable weather, natural disasters and new \nepidemics. Those grave dangers are driving poorer \nnations into deeper destitution.\n\nWe must rally together to escape poverty, fight \ndisease, protect the environment, respond to natural \ndisasters and build a greener and more just world. \nPoor countries and peoples need to lift themselves out \nof poverty with the help of wealthier people and more \ndeveloped countries. That help must arise not only from \na sense of philanthropy \u2014 as we say in Viet Nam, whole \nleaves wrap torn ones \u2014 but above all from a sense of \nresponsibility and understanding of our joint destiny. \nAfter all, poorer people and nations have contributed \nto the wealth of richer nations and people, and they \ndeserve a more prosperous future.\n\nI urge the global community to craft, with a sense \nof responsibility and humanity, an ambitious post-\n2015 development agenda and to redouble our efforts \nto promote peace, to end hunger and poverty and to \nprotect our planet. Together we can develop a road map \nof actions for poorer nations to effectively participate \nin international agreements and institutions and to \nface and overcome global challenges and dangers in \nthe spirit of the motto adopted by Alexandre Dumas\u2019s \nmusketeers \u2014 \u201cOne for all and all for one\u201d.\n\nAs a Vietnamese, what I have shared with the \nAssembly comes from experiences soaked in sweat \nand blood. Just a few decades ago, the very name \u201cViet \nNam\u201d was synonymous with war, division, blood and \ntears. A remote country called Viet Nam suffered \n15 million tons of bombs \u2014 four times the amount used \nin the Second World War. Each Vietnamese bore nearly \n10 times his or her weight in bombs, not to mention our \npopulation\u2019s suffering from over 70 million litres of the \nsilent but deadly Agent Orange/dioxin compound.\n\nAccording to a traditional Vietnamese expression, \nbenevolence triumphs over brutality and virtue drives \nout tyranny. With courageous sacrifice and creativity \nand with the support of peace-loving people, nations \nand international organizations, Viet Nam has defended \nits independence, united and rebuilt from the ashes of \nwar, and left the past behind to become an active and \nresponsible member of the international community.\n\n\n\f\nViet Nam has integrated the Millennium Development \nGoals into the formulation and implementation of our \ndevelopment strategy, and it has balanced economic \ndevelopment and social security. We have received a \nUnited Nations Food and Agriculture Organization \naward for our outstanding achievements in poverty \nreduction, Because we consider people the goal \nand centre of development, Viet Nam pays special \nattention to providing health care, education and the \nmeans of communication even for people in remote, \nunderdeveloped areas and among our ethnic minorities.\n\nViet Nam is working actively with other members of \nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations community \nto build it into a common house for all South-East \nAsian nations that were once deeply divided by war. \nThat work vividly embodies our aspirations to a bright \nfuture of peace, cooperation and prosperity, to unity in \ndiversity, and to the accomplishment of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals.\n\nHaving survived devastating wars of aggression \nand extreme poverty, our aspirations to peace and \nprosperity burn ever more brightly. We are committed \nto doing more to participate in peacebuilding, poverty \nreduction, environmental protection and other efforts. \nWe stand ready to join United Nations peacekeeping \noperations. We are willing to share our resources and \nexperience as a tribute to the international friends who \nhave supported us in our struggle for independence, \nunification and poverty reduction. \n\nViet Nam remains and always will be a reliable \npartner and responsible member of the international \ncommunity. In the area of food, for example, Viet \nNam, a country that has traditionally suffered from \nhunger, has become a leading rice exporter. We have \nachieved national food security but consider it our \nresponsibility to help maintain global food security. \nWe not only export, but also help countries to become \nself-reliant in food production, as we have done in \nCuba, Mozambique, Angola, Mali, Madagascar, \nMyanmar and elsewhere. We hope developed countries \nand international organizations will participate in \nsupporting similar programmes as a meaningful and \nsubstantive multiparty model of cooperation.\n\nI am deeply convinced that the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda will be created and finalized \nfor a world free from war and hunger and devoted to \npeace and cooperation, for sustainable development \nand prosperity for humankind, and for our evergreen \nplanet. Viet Nam commits itself to that purpose.\n"

Our \nbest wishes and our continued support will accompany \nhim throughout his second term in office, so that he can \n\n\n\f\ncontinue with the same momentum the work started in \nall priority areas on the United Nations agenda and in \nparticular, that of the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs), the central concern of the current session. \n\nIt is for us an opportune moment to take the floor to \naddress the Assembly to talk about the situation in my \ncountry, on the one hand, and to mention some current \nissues that are presently of concern to the international \ncommunity, on the other hand.\n\nWith regard to my country, my statement will \nfocus on the political and economic situation and on \nour progress regarding the Millennium Development \nGoals, for which we are called upon to establish new \nbenchmarks.\n\nIn the political area, we are preparing to hold general \nelections in 2015. As we have always said, including \nduring our previous elections, we have promised to the \npeople of Burundi and the international community to \nhold transparent, free and peaceful elections. Burundi is \nseeking to set up a truth and reconciliation commission \nsoon, as was provided for in the Arusha Agreement for \nPeace and Reconciliation, in order to shed light on the \nmassive human rights violations after our independence \nand to create a more stable and democratic society.\n\nWith regard to socioeconomic concerns, in December \n2012 Burundi adopted a strategic policy instrument \nentitled \u201cVision Burundi 2025\u201d, which sets out what \nBurundi will look like in 2025. Its main pillars are \nthe goals to promote strong leadership at all levels of \nthe State apparatus, to provide good living conditions \nfor the population, to rely on an educated population \nthat enjoys good health, to promote accelerated and \ndouble-digit economic growth and to make the most \nof regional integration so as to increase and diversify \nthe economy of Burundi. Other goals include putting \nin place an aggressive demographic policy aimed at \nlimiting the population growth rate to 2 per cent in \n2025 and gradually restoring social cohesion and giving \npride of place back to the fundamental cultural values \nthat have always characterized Burundian society. One \ncould also cite the goals of setting up a village and \nurbanization policy aimed at significantly increasing \nthe urbanization rate to 40 per cent, as well as creating \nsynergies among the various development stakeholders \nand promoting a good context for dialogue and \nconsultation with respect to planning for development \nfinancing and implementing Vision Burundi.\n\nAlong those same lines, Burundi has also adopted \na second policy instrument, the Strategic Framework \nfor Growth to Combat Poverty 2012-2016, launched \nin February 2012. Its goals are the consolidation \nof peace, security and the rule of law, managing \npopulation growth, increasing agricultural production \nand marketing, improved efficiency in public spending, \na dynamic and efficient private sector, a sufficient \nincrease in energy production, and strengthening \ndevelopment capacity. \n\nSince the central theme of this debate pertains to \nthe post-2015 development agenda, it is appropriate \nfor my delegation to review Burundi\u2019s socioeconomic \nachievements. As the Assembly is aware, the \nMillennium Development Goals are the promise that \nwe made to the poorest and most vulnerable people of \nthe world. The MDGs have managed to place human \nbeings at the heart of the development agenda. I should \nnow like to turn to the status of the implementation of \nMDGs in my country, which I will review one by one.\n\nWith regard to MDG 1, on the eradication of extreme \npoverty, we have seen relatively good progress since \n2006. Even so, we must note that, although generally \nthe rate of poverty has steadily decreased from 81 per \ncent in 1998 and to 67 per cent in 2006, it is nonetheless \nunlikely that Burundi will reach its target.\n\nWith respect to MDG 2, achieving universal \nprimary education, many improvements have been \nnoted in terms of the net enrolment rate in primary \nschool education in Burundi, which rose from 52 per \ncent in 1990 to 96 per cent in 2010. That occurred as a \nresult of policy measures, in particular the presidential \nmeasure taken in 2005 regarding free schooling, and \nbecause the restoration of peace has enabled even \nchildren beyond school age to be enrolled in school. \nIt is therefore possible that the second MDG will be \nachieved in 2015.\n\nConcerning MDG 3, on gender equality and the \nempowerment of women, there is near parity of girls \nand boys in primary school, but disparities have \nincreased in secondary school. In higher education, the \nratio of girls to boys has improved. In State institutions, \nwe have seen an increase in the number of women in \nParliament, with 43 per cent in the National Assembly \nand 50 per cent in the Senate. Those figures far \nexceed the stipulation in the 2005 Constitution, which \nestablished a quota of 30 per cent for women in political \ninstitutions.\n\n\n\f\nWith respect to the MDG 4 target of reducing the \nunder-five mortality rate, that rate has decreased by \n35 per cent, going from 88 deaths per 1,000 live births \nin 1990 to 57 per 1,000 in 2010. Despite that progress, \nwe are still far from the hoped-for 13.5 per cent, which \nwas our aim in order to achieve the target of reducing \nby two thirds the under-five mortality rate. The relative \nimprovement is due to more people going to health-care \nfacilities, because we have made health care free for \nchildren under 5.\n\nWith regard to MDG 5, on improving maternal \nhealth, the target is to reduce by three quarters the \nmaternal mortality rate by 2015. The mortality ratio has \nundergone a downward trend since 1990. It decreased at \na rate of 30 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births per \nyear, amounting to a reduction of 54.5 per cent between \n1990 and 2010.\n\nAs to MDG 6, combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and \nother diseases, a survey conducted in 2010 shows that \nthe HIV prevalence is estimated at 1.4 per cent in the \npopulation aged 15 to 49 years, while among women \nages 15 to 24 years old it is 0.8 per cent, as compared \nwith 3.5 per cent in 2007. Nonetheless, we see a \ndownward trend of HIV prevalence among women ages \n15 to 24, according to the sentinel surveilance system. \nWith regard to the status of HIV orphans, the available \ndata show that the number of deaths has gone from \n12,000 per year in 2004 to fewer than 6,000 per year in \n2011. That is a decrease of approximately 50 per cent.\n\nWith regard to MDG 7, ensuring environmental \nsustainability, in Burundi the percentage has gone from \n70 per cent to 72.5 per cent in 20 years. Data show that \nthe proportion of the population using an improved \nsanitation system remained stagnant, at around 46 per \ncent, between 1990 and 2010.\n\nIn terms of MDG 8, on a global partnership for \ndevelopment, Burundi does its utmost to mobilize \ndomestic resources and external support \u2014 estimated \nat $75 billion \u2014 in order to achieve the MDGs by 2015.\n\nConcerning Burundi\u2019s position vis-\u00e0-vis the post-\n2015 agenda, it is evident from national consultations \nwith all segments of the population that a post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda should focus on the following \nareas: governance, inequality, conflict and fragility; \neconomic growth and employment; energy, water \nand a sustainable environment; access to basic social \nservices; and food security.\n\nSubstantial progress has been made with respect to \nthe strategic framework for peacebuilding, and a third \nphase of the programme is currently being developed by \nthe Government, in conjunction with the United Nations \nOffice in Burundi and the parent office in New York. In \nview of the notable progress that has already been made \nsince our country was first placed on the agenda of the \nPeacebuilding Commission, Burundi considers that it is \nnow time for it to withdraw gradually from that agenda \nin order to make way for other countries whose need is \ncurrently greater.\n\nAt the same time, my Government has expressed \nthe wish to see the United Nations Office in Burundi \nconvert in February 2014 to a Burundi country team \noffice. That would enable Burundi to work in close \ncollaboration with the United Nations team and with \nother partners to meet the socioeconomic challenges \nwith which it is currently faced.\n\nHaving summarized my Government\u2019s achievements, \nI shall now talk about Burundi\u2019s role regionally and \ninternationally. \n\nWith regard to its international role, Burundi was \none of the first two countries to take the courageous \ndecision to participate in the African Union Mission in \nSomalia (AMISOM), where it has served since 2007. I \nshould emphasize that Burundi is proud of the progress \ntowards normalization in Somalia, but we call upon all \nthe partners to strengthen the operational capacity of \nAMISOM so that it may complete its mission.\n\nBurundi is also participating in peacekeeping \noperations in Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Haiti and the Sudan. Soon, \nit will be participating in Mali and the Central African \nRepublic. The recent election of Mr. Boubacar Keita \nas the country\u2019s President is undoubtedly a decisive \nstep in re-establishing the principles of democracy \nthat governed the country in the past. That is the \nright path towards normalization. In our view, those \nsuccessful elections are an important step in terms of \nMali\u2019s recovery. A Burundian contingent is ready to be \ndeployed in that country. \n\nWith regard to the security situation in the eastern \npart of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi \naligns itself with other members of the International \nConference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) and \npartners such as the African Union and the United \nNations to ensure peace in that country. In that regard, \nwe reaffirm our commitment through the terms of \nthe agreement of 15 December 2006 and the relevant \n\n\n\f\nprotocols of the ICGLR, as well as statements and \ndecisions made by Heads of State and Government of \nmember States in Addis Abeba and Kampala. At the \nregional level, we reaffirm our commitment, under the \nPeace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and the Region, \nsigned in Addis Ababa on 24 February. \n\nWith regard to the very unstable situation in the \nCentral African Republic, Burundi, as a member of \nthe Economic Community of Central African States, is \nready to work with other nations to deploy a military \ncontingent there in order to participate in re-establishing \npeace. \n\nConcerning the situation in Egypt, Burundi hopes \nthat the Egyptian people find a swift way out of the \ncrisis. With our African Union and United Nations \npartners, we are prepared to ensure that the Arab \nRepublic of Egypt and its people revive their democratic \ninstitutions. \n\nWith regard to Syria, Burundi believes that the \ninternational community must do all it can to help \nall parties reach a ceasefire in order to settle their \ndifferences peaceably. \n\nWith regard to the conflict in the Middle East, \nBurundi reiterates its support for a negotiated solution \nthat leads to two States living side by side in peace and \nmutual respect, in line with the relevant resolutions of \nthe Security Council. \n\nTerrorism in its various forms has become a source \nof daily concern. Not even a week goes by without an \nact of terrorism being carried out somewhere in the \nworld. Barbaric acts strike indiscriminately, affecting \ninnocent people who have had the misfortune of finding \nthemselves in the wrong place at the wrong time. \n\nThe Government of Burundi would like to take this \nopportunity to condemn, in the firmest way possible, the \ncowardly and arbitrary terrorist attack at the Westgate \nMall in Nairobi. That heinous act has plunged into \nmourning not only Kenya, but the entire international \ncommunity, given the different nationalities of the \nvictims. We would like to convey to our brothers the \npeople of Kenya and to their Government our sincere \ncondolences and to reassure them of our friendship \nand solidarity. Burundi reiterates its full support for \nthe United Nations Global Counter-terrorism Strategy, \nadopted by Member States in 2006. \n\nWith regard to the International Criminal Court, \nBurundi would like to express its full solidarity with the \npeople of Kenya, who have just democratically elected \ntheir leaders. Burundi would like the Court to review \nhow it functions so that it can benefit Member States of \nthe international community as a whole. Burundi calls \nfor a review of the Rome Statute at the next meeting \nof States parties, which is to take place from 20 to \n28 November. In the meantime, it is important that the \npeace and reconciliation processes on our continent be \nstrengthened rather than weakened.\n\nBurundi welcomes the ministerial meeting to be \nheld by the African Union on the sidelines of the sixty-\neight session of the General Assembly on 27 September, \nas well as the announcement that a summit of Heads of \nState will be held on 11 and 12 October in Addis Ababa.\n\nWe have renewed the commitment of the \nGovernment of Burundi to achieve the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and to ensure peace and security. \nWe would like to conclude our statement by reiterating \nBurundi\u2019s commitment to the ideals of the Charter of \nthe United Nations. \n\nMy Government hopes that cooperation between \nthe United Nations and the African Union can be \nstrengthened in terms of tackling issues related to \nAfrican countries in accordance with the letter and spirit \nof the founding documents of those two institutions. \n"

        "file_text": "As we meet this \nmorning to address global concerns and seek ways to \nensure progress and lasting peace, the people of Kenya \nare emerging from a terrorist attack that has cost them \nmany lives and shaken the continent. In expressing our \nsolidarity with the Government and the people of Kenya \nand with the families of the victims, Mauritius would \nalso like to express its unreserved condemnation of that \nabominable and dastardly act of terrorism. The Nairobi \nattack should also compel us to revisit regional and \nglobal responses to national and international security \nthreats, including extending support to countries, \nparticularly those on the African continent.\n\nMauritius commends you, Mr. President, for the \ntheme you have proposed for the sixty-eighth session \nof the Assembly, namely, \u201cThe post-2015 development \nagenda: setting the stage\u201d. The goals we set ourselves \nfor the sustainable development of our national and \nglobal economies will shape the lives of generations to \ncome. I would like to say at the outset that Mauritius \nwelcomes the report of the High-level Panel of Eminent \nPersons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda, A New \nGlobal Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform \nEconomies through Sustainable Development, and in \nparticular the recommendation that deliberations on a \nnew development agenda must be guided by the vision \nof eradicating extreme poverty for all in the context of \nsustainable development. We also welcome the Panel\u2019s \nview that one of the transformative shifts for the post-\n2015 agenda should be to bring a new sense of global \npartnership into national and international politics.\n\nClimate change should be one of the top priorities for \nthe global agenda. The report of the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change, Climate Change 2013: The \nPhysical Science Basis, released only yesterday, is \nunequivocal. It provides clear scientific confirmation \nthat we humans are responsible for global warming, \nand that it is up to us to take appropriate measures to try \nto save our home planet. We cannot and should not any \nlonger ignore the evidence that we humans are putting \nlife on Earth in jeopardy. \n\nIn our region, we have recently seen an increased \nand unprecedented intensity and unpredictability of \nweather events. In March, my country experienced \nunprecedented flash floods that caused losses of human \nlife and heavy economic losses. No country is safe from \nnatural disasters and the damaging effects of climate \nchange. But for many small island developing States \n(SIDS), the foreseeable consequences of climate change \nthreaten us even more dramatically, in terms of both \nhuman and economic development. For some SIDS, \nthey pose an existential threat.\n\nWe fully support the Secretary-General\u2019s proposal \nto convene world leaders to a climate summit in New \nYork in 2014. We hope that that meeting will provide \nan opportunity for world leaders to focus political \nattention on climate change and take meaningful action \nto mitigate its effects. We must start putting the interests \nof our home planet above everything else. The world \nneeds a global, legally binding agreement on climate \nchange by 2015. At the Paris meeting of the twenty-\nfirst Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, we should \nadopt a treaty that is universal and ambitious and that \nconcretely addresses the concerns of all, including \nthose of the most vulnerable States.\n\nThe international community should also pay more \nattention to disaster risk reduction and adopt a more \nconcerted and accelerated approach to reaching the \ngoals set out in the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-\n2015 (see A/CONF.206/6). The time has come to address \ndisaster risks and climate-change adaptation through \nan integrated approach, and to adopt resilience as a \ncommon and shared vision. Mauritius welcomes Japan\u2019s \ndecision to host the World Conference on Disaster \nReduction in early 2015 to review the implementation \nof the Hyogo Framework and chart an ambitious post-\n2015 framework for disaster risk reduction. \n\nIn that regard, the holding in Samoa next year of \nthe Third International Conference on Small Island \nDeveloping States could not be more timely. We hope \nthat the Conference will be a landmark in the history of a \nmore active and collaborative partnership among SIDS \nand between SIDS and the international community. \n\n\n\f\nFurthermore, it could be an opportunity to give new \nmeaning to the concept of global concerns, issues that \nare, or should be, the concern of the global community \nat large, and not only of those who are more vulnerable \nand more at risk. That would be in line with the spirit \nof the global partnership that the High-level Panel has \ncalled for.\n\nThe prospects for growth in the global economy \nremain uncertain, largely as a result of the multiple \nchallenges faced by developed countries. In such an \ninterconnected and interdependent world as ours, no \nnation is immune to external shocks. Small developing \ncountries are very concerned about the slowdown \nin global growth, declines in international trade, \ndecreasing job opportunities and rising inequality. \nSmall States are particularly susceptible to external \nshocks, as they are heavily dependent on foreign \nmarkets for trade, tourism and investments. They are \nalso concerned about energy and food prices, which are \nsubject to high volatility.\n\nMy Government believes that the post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda should include a road map for an \ninterconnected world economic system, premised on the \nassumption that the global economy could very well be \nas weak as its weakest links. Of course, the specificities \nof some countries or regions and the pace at which the \ntransformative shifts are implemented may not always \nbe appropriate for universal targets. But the conceptual \napproach to, and the design of, the post-2015 agenda \nshould, more than ever before, start with the shared \nconviction that economies are interdependent.\n\nEradicating extreme poverty, empowering more \nwomen, providing wider opportunities to young people \nfor education and jobs, improving health care and the \nmanagement of energy, water and food are all universal \nconcerns. The conventional divides of the past are \nno longer valid. We need a common development \nframework but with differentiated milestones and \nimplementation strategies, given the existing disparities \nin the levels of development. Actions taken at the \nnational level are not sufficient; there should also be \nreinforced cooperation and partnerships at the regional \nand international levels. It is therefore imperative that \nthe weaknesses and the inequity of the current global \neconomic governance should be addressed urgently.\n\nWe are at a juncture where we have no option but \nto revisit the existing global economic governance \nmechanisms. An overhaul of the current economic \ngovernance is clearly long overdue. We must have a more \nparticipatory system of global economic governance, \nwhere developing countries would be more involved \nin international economic decision-making and norm-\nsetting. The voice of all nations, big or small, should be \nequally heard and taken into consideration.\n\nMauritius has, on several occasions, reiterated that \nthe United Nations Economic and Social Council needs \nto play a more prominent role in global economic, social, \nand environmental issues. We cannot overstate the \nimportance of coordination and synergy for avoiding \nduplication among parallel United Nations processes \nand initiatives so as to ensure optimal benefit for all.\n\nMy Government is of the view that all the processes \ninitiated in the Rio+20 Conference last year, including \nthose relating to strengthening the Economic and Social \nCouncil, sustainable development goals and sustainable \ndevelopment financing, should converge towards a \nsingle post-2015 development agenda that should be \nadopted during a high-level development summit \nin 2015. The post-2015 development agenda should \ncomplete the unfinished business of the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. However, it should also go beyond \nthem and provide for a systemic change and a new global \neconomic governance. The guiding principles enshrined \nin the Declaration on the Right to Development, adopted \nin December 1986 (resolution 41/133), are still relevant \ntoday and should not be overlooked in the formulation \nof a post-2015 development agenda.\n\nMy country will follow, with particular interest, the \nwork of the high-level political forum on sustainable \ndevelopment, especially since it replaces the \nCommission on Sustainable Development, which was \nthe primary intergovernmental forum for monitoring \nthe implementation of the Barbados Programme of \nAction and the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation.\n\nAs we set the stage for the post-2015 development \nagenda, we must, as global leaders, define a new global \nvision for the world\u2019s oceans. The United Nations system \nhas played a crucial role in formulating, implementing \nand enforcing a new international order relating to the \noceans. Indeed, the adoption of the United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea in 1982 will remain \none of the landmarks of the twentieth century.\n\nThe jurisprudence of the International Court of \nJustice and the International Tribunal for the Law of \nthe Sea has contributed to the settlement of maritime \ndisputes and the promotion of international peace, \n\n\n\f\nsecurity and equity in a manner not always witnessed in \nother areas of international relations. The establishment \nof the International Seabed Authority is another \nsignificant example of what international cooperation \ncan lead to in other sectors. The International Maritime \nOrganization and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic \nCommission of UNESCO are also making significant \ncontributions.\n\nI believe that the United Nations must now take the \nlead in formulating a global vision for the oceans that \nwill, in particular, expand the economic space for small \nisland States while ensuring sustainable use of living \nand non-living resources. The health of our economies \nwill depend on the health of our oceans. Our vision for \nthe future must also preserve the inherent values of \nthe ocean space, to which we are looking for economic \nexpansion.\n\nMauritius has taken the initiative of launching a \nnational dialogue on how to promote the ocean economy \nas one of the main pillars of development. We urge the \ninternational community to build on what the world has \nachieved so far in relation to ocean-related economic \nactivities and conservation, and we propose for future \ngenerations a fundamental paradigm shift with respect \nto economic space. While such a global vision and \nstrategy will be beneficial to all nations, it will be of \nparticular interest to small islands. With limited land \nareas, the islands can potentially be large ocean States \nand thus overcome some of their vulnerabilities as \nsmall island developing States. As the world realizes \nthe tremendous potential of marine renewable energies, \nwe will see the oceans from a different perspective.\n\nThe United Nations has a key role to play in \npromoting the rule of law at both the national and the \ninternational levels. The rule of law at the international \nlevel must be an integral part of the post-2015 agenda. \nOpen and participatory democracy, accountability and \ntransparency are not concepts that should be promoted \nonly at the national level. The United Nations should \nlead by example here. We should focus on reforming \nour Organization and on making it more responsive to \nthe needs and aspirations of its constituents.\n\nIn that context, we should work together on the \nreform of the Security Council and the revitalization \nof the General Assembly and on improving the working \nmethods of our Organization. Mauritius believes that a \ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council should \ninclude reform in the membership of both the permanent \nand non-permanent categories. We reaffirm our \ncommitment to the African common position enshrined \nin the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. \nWe believe that Africa should not be deprived of its right \nto permanent representation in the Council. Likewise, \nwe believe that Latin America deserves permanent \nrepresentation in the Council and that SIDS should also \nbe entitled to a seat on the Council. Mauritius further \nreiterates its support for India\u2019s legitimate aspiration to \na permanent seat in a reformed Security Council.\n\nMauritius also reiterates its firm conviction that the \nrule of law should prevail in the resolution of disputes, \nin accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. \nWe believe that the international community has an \nobligation to ensure that, in line with the principles of \nthe rule of law, nations should submit their disputes to \nconciliation, mediation, adjudication or other peaceful \nmeans, both judicial and non-judicial.\n\nThe dismemberment of part of our territory, \nthe Chagos archipelago, prior to independence, by \nthe then colonial Power the United Kingdom, was in \nclear breach of international law and left the process \nof decolonization, not only of Mauritius but of Africa \nin general, incomplete. Yet, the United Kingdom has \nshown no inclination to engage in any process that would \nlead to a settlement of that shameful part of its colonial \npast. I am confident that the United Kingdom and the \nUnited States of America want to be on the right side \nof history. States that look to the law and to the rules \nof the comity of nations for the resolution of disputes \nshould not be frustrated by the lack of avenues under \ninternational law for the settlement of such disputes.\n\nTromelin, which is also an integral part of our \nterritory, is the subject of ongoing discussions with \nthe French Government, and pending a final resolution \nof the issue, Mauritius and France have concluded a \nframework agreement on the co-management of the \nisland and its surrounding maritime areas, without \nprejudice to the sovereignty of Mauritius over Tromelin.\n\nIn our part of the world, we welcome the rise of a \nre-energized Africa. The return to normalcy in Mali \nand the recent holding of elections there show the \nrelevance of international partnerships. The situation \nin Madagascar and in the Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo will, hopefully, be resolved soon through \nthe support of the international community for the \ninitiatives of the Southern African Development \nCommunity in that regard.\n\n\n\f\nEarlier this year, Mauritius hosted an African \nministerial conference on regional integration. We are \nconvinced that African nations will benefit significantly \nfrom a greater focus on regional cooperation, and I am \npleased to note that the solemn declaration adopted on \nthe fiftieth anniversary of the African Union supports \nthat view.\n\nThe tragic events in Syria over the last two years \nare of serious concern to the global community. \nThere is also concern about attempts to bypass the \nSecurity Council and to initiate action in breach of \nthe United Nations Charter. Respect for the rule of \nlaw at the international level entails compliance with \ninternationally agreed norms. Mauritius will support \nthe decisions taken by the organs of the United Nations \nunder the Charter.\n\nWe welcome the Security Council resolution \nthat addresses one of the issues in the Syrian crisis. \nHowever, the international community needs to go \nfurther and address the issue of political dialogue, \nwhich will enable the Syrian people to live in peace.\n\nMauritius also supports a Middle East that is free \nof weapons of mass destruction. That means that no \ncountry in the region should hold nuclear or chemical \nweapons.\n\nMauritius is convinced that an essential condition \nfor peace and prosperity in the Middle East is the \npeaceful coexistence of the States of Palestine and \nIsrael. Mauritius wishes to reiterate its solidarity with \nthe Palestine National Authority and the Palestinian \npeople in their rightful aspiration to win full recognition \nas a State Member of the United Nations.\n\nMauritius also supports the peaceful restoration \nof democracy in Egypt, which has a key role to play \nin promoting stability and security in the region. \nBut the international community cannot condone the \nremoval by force from office and the detention of a \ndemocratically elected leader.\n\n(spoke in French)\nThe general debate of the General Assembly offers \nus a unique opportunity to highlight the most urgent \nchallenges that humankind is currently facing. We \nmust take advantage of this opportunity to review \nrecent events and to outline new approaches that will \nenable us to respond to these challenges in keeping with \nthe principles enshrined in the Charter of the United \nNations. We must address those challenges through a \nshared vision of peace, security, interdependence and \nrespect for fundamental rights and freedoms.\n\nWe must remain staunch in protecting the right \nto development. We also have the duty to take a \ndifferentiated approach so as to ensure that our \ndevelopment model is sustainable and allows us to \nleave to future generations the values our world holds \ndear. Our success will depend on the collective will and \ncommitment. If we succeed, we will go down in history \nas having met today\u2019s challenges and expectations in \nterms of the future.\n\n(spoke in English)\nTo conclude, let me say that we need to act \ntogether, in a spirit of compromise and tolerance. We \nshould constantly remind ourselves that we are of \none kind, humankind. There are not, and never will \nbe, ideal solutions that will satisfy all of us. But we, \nthe leaders of our respective countries, need to look \nbeyond the horizon and have the moral courage to look \nat our common humanity so that we may move forward \ntowards making our world a better, more prosperous \nand safer place for the whole of humankind.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great \nhonour for me to take the floor at the sixty-eighth \nsession of the General Assembly, which is being held in \nthe context of some rather disturbing developments in \nterms of peace and security \u2014 developments that, very \nappropriately, we have an opportunity to consider and \nto deal with under the provisions of the United Nations \nCharter.\n\nAs I begin my statement I should like to congratulate \nMr. John Ashe on his election to the presidency, without \nforgetting the team that is helping him. I should also \nlike to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \ntireless efforts in areas such as sustainable development, \npeace, security and counter-terrorism, particularly in \nour region of the Sahel.\n\n\nThe theme of the sixty-eighth session, \u201cThe post-\n2015 development agenda: setting the stage\u201d, leads us \nto ask what measures to take, in the spirit of solidarity, \nonce we have established that many countries will not \nachieve the Millennium Development Goals within the \ntime frame, as is the case with my country, the Niger. \n\nThis session of the General Assembly gives me an \nopportunity to review the ongoing efforts in our country \nin that area. The renaissance programme established \nsince President Mahamadou Issoufou was elected to head \nour country makes agriculture, health and education \nabsolute priorities, so that we can substantially improve \nour human development index performance. Resources \nexpended for that purpose have enabled our country \nto make significant progress. We have, in particular, \nreduced the proportion of the population living in \nextreme poverty and chronic undernourishment. I \nshould like to welcome the significant assistance from \nbilateral partners and from international organizations, \nincluding non-governmental organizations, which are \nassisting the Government of the Niger in its policies \nand programmes for a harmonious socioeconomic \ndevelopment. It is for that purpose that the Government \nlaunched an ambitious socioeconomic development \nprogramme. A round table of donors was held last \nNovember in Paris, at which pledges totalling more than \n$4.8 billion were announced. That amount exceeded \nthe expectations of my Government.\n\nWe call for the effective mobilization of those \ncommitments, so that we can take action in five \nstrategic areas:, namely, building the credibility \nand effectiveness of public institutions; establishing \n\f\nconditions for sustainable, balanced and inclusive \ndevelopment; food security and sustainable agricultural \ndevelopment; a competitive and diversified economy \ndesigned to promote accelerated and inclusive growth; \nand the promotion of social development.\n\nGiven the particular interest accorded to rural \npopulations by our President, we have developed \nand launched the \u201cthree N\u2019s\u201d initiative \u2014 Nigeriens \nfeeding Nigeriens \u2014 with the goal of promoting \nfood security and food sovereignty, in order to end \nthe food shortages caused by recurring droughts. \nThe programme is intended to improve agricultural \nproductivity by promoting irrigation through the \njudicious development of the substantial water potential \nof our country, by improving production techniques \nthrough the substantial use of inputs and machinery, \nby reorganizing the farming sector, by rationalizing \ndistribution channels for agricultural products and by \nbuilding roads in rural areas.\n\nAlways bearing in mind the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, our Government is paying \nparticular attention to the vital question of education, \nincluding the construction of schools, the delivery of \nschool supplies, the extensive recruitment of teachers \nand the improvement of teachers\u2019 working conditions. \nIt is determined, too, to pursue a bold, consciousness-\nraising policy aimed at controlling population growth, \nwhich is currently negating the impact of the remarkable \neconomic growth that we have experienced in the past \ntwo years.\n\nAs I said at the beginning of my statement, this \nsession is taking place at a time when the purpose and \nrole of the Organization are being sorely tested, owing \nto an international situation characterized by persisting \nor new crises and conflicts. Now more than ever, we \nneed to rise to the challenge, bearing in mind the \npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United \nNations.\n\nWe call upon the General Assembly, and in \nparticular the Security Council, to continue to work \nresolutely to arrive at negotiated and lasting solutions \nto situations where lethal crises have the potential to \ncause desolation and displacement and compromise \nsocioeconomic development. \n\nFor us in the Sahel the major concern in 2012 and \n2013 has been Mali. The Niger is pleased with the \npositive outcome in that country and the follow-up \nmachinery put in place by the Organization through \nthe United Nations Multidimensional Integrated \nStabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), whose \nestablishment was possible thanks to a considerable \nmobilization of the international community. That \nmobilization was driven by the Economic Community \nof West African States (ECOWAS), which dedicated a \nnumber of very high-level meetings to the subject of \nMali, and was effectively relayed by the African Union \nthrough its Peace and Security Council. It was followed \nup on a regular basis by the United Nations, whose \nSecurity Council has adopted many resolutions on the \nsubject.\n\nBut today, as we take stock of that joint action, we \nare duty-bound to recognize that we owe the health \nof Mali more especially to the far-sighted decision of \nPresident Hollande to launch Operation Serval, which \nwas able to put an end to the terrorist coalition in early \nJanuary 2013, thanks to the sizeable means put at its \ndisposal, making it equal to the task.We must recognize \nalso that, while ECOWAS rightly and promptly opted \nfor a military intervention, most of the States that were \nsupposed to mobilize troop contingents were slow \nto make them available and operational. The United \nNations, for its part, sought to differentiate between \nterrorist organizations, so that, against all the evidence, \nit could promote a dialogue with some of them. We \nwho were facing the threat were made very anxious by \nsome of the debates at the United Nations, which could \nhave been avoided if only the facts had been faced and \nthe straightforwardness of the evidence noted. The \nunjustified stalling by the international community \nencouraged the terrorists to press their advantage by \nadopting a new agenda and new goals, enabling them to \nenvisage total victory over Malian territory, and even \nbeyond.\n\nIf I dwell on this it is, first, because I know how \nclose we came to disaster, and, secondly, because it is \nmy deep conviction that just because our enterprise \nis complex it does not necessarily mean that we are \ndoomed to inaction at best and to mistakes at worst.\n\nIn spite of what I have just said, the action of the \ninternational community in Mali yielded very positive \nresults, thanks to the support of all. Mali, in addition \nto being free, on 11 August chose its President in \nan election that was in every respect remarkable. I \nshould like to extend once again my congratulations to \nPresident Keita.\n\nThe international community should continue \nto support Mali, adding to the troops and capacity of \n\n\n\f\nMINUSMA, so that it can complete the job of eradicating \nthe terrorist groups. These are now in difficult straits, \nbut are far from having, as it were, uttered their final \nword.\n\nIt is also urgent to put in place regional and \ninternational coordination, the job of which would be \nto provide security for all of the Sahelo-Saharan area. \nVigorous measures of a general nature need to be taken \nagainst drug trafficking and cross-border organized \ncrime. In that regard, I wish to express my sympathy \nfor the plight of the hostages held by terrorists in the \nSahelo-Saharan area. I convey my condolences to \ntheir families and call for more efforts to achieve their \nprompt release.\n\nThe problems of the Sahel are not just security \nproblems. That part of the world is among the most \nafflicted. It is subject to the effects of climate change, \ndesertification and recurring droughts, as well as \nthe resulting food shortages and malnutrition. It \nneeds significant investment as part of a sustained \nglobal strategy, supported by the entire international \ncommunity, to ensure the economic progress that is \nvital for its stabilization and its deliverance from the \nclutches of violence.\n\nTerrorism in Africa affects not only the Sahel, but \nalso the Horn of Africa. It struck the Kenyan people on \n23 September in the form of the bloody and murderous \nattack on the Westgate Mall in Nairobi. I should like to \ntake this opportunity to express my condolences to the \nGovernment of Kenya.\n\nThe populations in the Central African Republic \nare, tragically, experiencing an unprecedented level \nof violence. The Niger calls for an international \nintervention, as in Mali in January 2013, to put an end \nto the martyrdom of the people of the Central African \nRepublic.\n\nWith respect to Palestine, it is heartbreaking to \nthink that in today\u2019s world, so characterized by highly \nsophisticated technology and so imbued with modern \nvalues, a people could be deprived of its most elementary \nrights. The Niger is hopeful that the current initiative of \nthe United States Government will be successful and \nwill lead to the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian \nState beside and in harmonious coexistence with Israel.\n\nWhat is happening in Syria is a veritable tragedy, \neven in this topsy-turvy world. A millennial civilization \nis crumbling before our eyes. We condemn the use of \nchemical weapons, as occurred on 21 August, and call \nupon the United Nations to reach a political solution at \nthe upcoming \u201cGeneva II\u201d conference.\n\nFor a number of decades now, the Cuban population \nhas endured a trade, economic and financial embargo. \nWe call for the lifting of that embargo.\n\nIn conclusion, I express my fervent hope that our \ndeliberations will help advance the cause of peace, \nsecurity and progress throughout the world.\n\n"

        "file_text": "Every day, the peoples of \nthe world whom we are privileged to represent in the \nGeneral Assembly look on in helpless horror at the \nslaughter in Syria. They can see gassed children lined \nout, dead, on their television screens. They can access \nonline the facts about the 100,000 Syrians who have \nbeen killed; the 4 million who have been displaced; \nand the 2 million or more who have been driven into \nrefugee camps in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.\n\nThe peoples who have sent us, Government leaders \nand diplomats, to speak for them in this Hall are \nasking, \u201cWhy can we not stop this slaughter and this \nsuffering?\u201d They see the conflict in real time. It is not \ntaking place in a remote part of the planet. Its brutality \nis made more visible by modern technology. The utterly \ncallous attack in Ghouta on 21 August marked a new \nlow in the endless litany of horrors.\n\nFrom the very outset, Ireland has consistently \nargued that the United Nations and the Security Council \nmust be central to any efforts to resolve the crisis and \nensure that international law and basic human rights \nare upheld. And while it has taken much longer than we \nwould all have wished, I welcome the decisive action \nthe Security Council has now taken on Syria.\n\n\nSecurity Council resolution 2118 (2013) marks a \nwatershed in the international community\u2019s engagement \non the crisis. It offers renewed hope and confidence \nthat the United Nations is capable of discharging \nits responsibilities and meeting the aspirations and \nexpectations of the peoples of the world. The resolution \nbuilds on the vital breakthrough achieved by the United \nStates and Russia in agreeing to a framework for the \ncomplete elimination of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons. Full \ncompliance by the Syrian regime with its obligations \nis imperative. Ireland has already pledged \u20ac200,000 in \nfunding to support the vital role of the Organization for \nthe Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, assisted by the \nUnited Nations, in implementing those arrangements.\n\nCrucially, the Security Council has called for \nthe early convening of an international conference to \naddress all aspects of the conflict. The inescapable \nreality is that the crisis can be resolved only politically, \nnot militarily. I am greatly encouraged by the \nindications that the \u201cGeneva II\u201d conference could be \nheld within a matter of weeks. Peace can come only \nthrough all Syrians engaging in a genuinely inclusive \nprocess aimed at agreeing a new political dispensation \nin their country.\n\nThe Security Council has expressed its conviction \nthat there must also be accountability for what has \noccurred in Syria. The International Criminal Court \nexists precisely for that purpose. We owe it to the Syrian \npeople to ensure that those responsible for the war \ncrimes committed against them are brought to justice. \n\nThere is also an urgent need to remove impediments \nto the delivery of humanitarian assistance. Violence \nagainst civilians must cease. All parties must facilitate \nunimpeded access to people in need throughout Syria \nand guarantee the safety and security of humanitarian \npersonnel who perform their duties at enormous \npersonal risk.\n\nThe humanitarian efforts being made by Syria\u2019s \nneighbours, including Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, \nare remarkable and deserve far more support from the \ninternational community. We should not underestimate \nthe strain being imposed on those countries and the \nthreats being posed to refugee populations. Ireland has \ncontributed $15 million to the humanitarian operation, \nand we stand ready to do more within our means.\n\nElsewhere in the Middle East, we also see the \nprospect of progress. In Ireland, we know what it takes \nto make peace after a protracted conflict. I want to \nacknowledge the work being done in the current direct \ntalks between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, \nwhich all who wish for peace must welcome. I want \nto commend in particular the determination and \n\n\n\f\nengagement of United States Secretary of State John \nKerry, who has done so much to bring that about, and \nthe leadership of President Abbas and Prime Minister \nNetanyahu, who have had to accept difficult choices to \nbegin the process of negotiation. We all know, and they \nknow, that many more difficult choices lie before them \nif they are to succeed and to secure a comprehensive \npeace settlement. They deserve all our support.\n\nWe are also encouraged by the stated determination \nof the new Iranian Government to address the \nconcerns of the international community and build \nconfidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its \nnuclear programme. We look forward to Iran\u2019s serious \nengagement in meaningful negotiations, leading to full \ncompliance with all of its international obligations, and \nhope that that will also contribute to the creation of a \npositive dynamic in the Middle East region.\n\nIreland currently participates in seven United \nNations peacekeeping missions, including each of \nthe three missions in the Middle East. In response to \na request of the Secretary-General, we are deploying \nIrish personnel to reinforce the United Nations \nDisengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) on the Golan \nHeights. We are doing so to help ensure that UNDOF \ncan continue to implement its mandate at a difficult \ntime. Ireland\u2019s deployment to that challenging mission \nis a signal of our deep commitment to the peacekeeping \nrole of the United Nations. The Irish people are rightly \nproud of these soldiers and of the record of our Defence \nForces, members of our police service and Irish civilians \ndeployed in the cause of peace.\n\nI join other speakers at this rostrum in condemning \nthe recent attack in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, which \nleft dozens of innocent people dead and almost 200 \ninjured. It was a chilling reminder that well-organized \nand ruthless international terrorist groups and networks \nare constantly searching for new locations and targets \nfor atrocities. My profound sympathy and that of the \npeople of Ireland go out to the victims of the attack and \ntheir families. We must be vigilant against terror and \nresolute in refusing to compromise our values in the \nface of such threats.\n\nMany factors contribute to human suffering. \nViolent conflict, such as that in Syria, is one \u2014 and \nthe toll of casualties there is escalating daily. But there \nare many parts of the world where underdevelopment, \nmalnutrition and disease exact an even greater toll. \nAround the globe, 870 million people \u2014 almost 200 \ntimes the entire population of Ireland \u2014 are living in \nextreme poverty and hunger. Every single day, 18,000 \nchildren die needlessly from preventable causes in the \npoorest and least developed regions of the world; 7,000 \nof them are children under the age of 5, who die because \nthey are undernourished. One in every four children is \nstunted, most of them in the poorest countries. And \nevery day, 800 women die because of complications \nduring pregnancy and childbirth, for basic reasons that \ncould have been prevented. \n\nReversing those trends and creating a better future \nfor the countless millions of impoverished people on \nour planet is, perhaps, the greatest moral and practical \nchallenge we face today. We can, of course, draw \ninspiration and hope from our successes. And there \nhave been successes. Thirteen years ago, at the United \nNations, world leaders committed to taking tangible, \nmeasurable action to tackle global poverty. Huge \nprogress has been made since then under the framework \nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \nSignificant numbers of people have been lifted out of \npoverty. Millions of children are receiving primary \neducation. Two billion people have access to improved \nwater supplies, and HIV/AIDS and other diseases and \npandemics are being tackled.\n\nNevertheless, fresh global challenges, such as \nclimate change, are beginning to undermine the \nprogress made. Communities in developing countries \nthat have contributed least to the causes of climate \nchange are suffering most from its effects. That is \nan injustice \u2014 clear and simple. It is a matter of \nfundamental human rights and equity. And it is critical \nfor the future of all of our children, in a world which is \nreaching the limits of environmental sustainability, that \nthis injustice be reversed.\n\nI had the privilege of taking part in this week\u2019s \nspecial event on the Millennium Development Goals \nand co-chairing one of the round-table sessions. \nIreland is proud to have co-facilitated the special event \nwith South Africa and to have achieved an outcome \ndocument that will guide negotiations over the next two \nyears on completing the MDGs and crafting the post-\n2015 development agenda.\n\nI believe that when world leaders gather at the \nUnited Nations in 2015, we can and should be ready \nto adopt a new set of global goals aimed at achieving a \nsustainable, just and secure world for the future. I want \nto see a clear commitment to ending extreme poverty \n\n\n\f\nand hunger in a generation. I want to see specific \ncommitments in relation to the empowerment of women \nand girls. And I want to see an integrated approach on \nclimate change and a strong focus on climate-sensitive \nagriculture.\n\nIn our own aid programme, my Government \nhas prioritized hunger and malnutrition, a theme \nthat resonates with Ireland\u2019s own history. We have \na very simple message about the vital importance of \ninvestment in nutrition for mothers and babies. We \nare leading supporters of the Scaling Up Nutrition \nmovement, and we are committed to doubling our aid \nspending on nutrition by 2016.\n\nIreland is today emerging from several years of an \neconomic crisis that will soon be behind us. After many \ntough decisions and a lot of hard work, we are about \nto safely exit an international bailout and our economy \nis back on track. I am proud to say that despite the \nextremely difficult circumstances many Irish people \nfind themselves in, we have sustained our commitment \nto the provision of development aid. I know that we are \nready to play our part in a new global partnership, and \nthat it is only through this body, the United Nations, \nthat it can be achieved.\n\nIt is a matter of great pride to my country that \nIreland was last year elected for the first time to the \nHuman Rights Council. I warmly thank the Member \nStates for their support in the election and the \nconfidence they have placed in us. Ireland played a lead \nrole in the adoption of two important resolutions by the \nHuman Rights Council this week \u2014 one on preventable \nmortality of children under five; the other recognizing \nthe important role played by civil society at the local, \nnational, regional and international levels.\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights \nadopted by the Assembly states that recognition of the \ninherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights \nof all members of the human family is the foundation of \nfreedom, justice and peace in the world. It also states that \nthose human rights should be protected in law. Today, \ninstead of offering protection, we increasingly see \nlegal measures being adopted to discriminate against \npeople on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender \nidentity. I welcome the courageous leadership shown \nby the Secretary-General when he promised in April to \nlead a global campaign for lesbian, gay, bisexual and \ntransgender rights. Ireland pledges its full support to \nthe efforts of the Secretary-General, both here in the \nGeneral Assembly and in the Human Rights Council.\n\nIreland is a small State that is deeply committed to \nthe United Nations and to the principles enshrined in \nits Charter. We are proud to contribute to the important \nefforts of the United Nations in peacekeeping, in conflict \nresolution, in development aid and in humanitarian \naction. There can be no doubt that the United Nations \nis the unique and indispensable forum where the \npeoples of the world share their collective concerns and \ndetermine to take action to make the world a better and \na safer place.\n\nThe membership of this Organization has \nconferred primary responsibility for the maintenance \nof international peace and security on the Security \nCouncil. Accordingly, we look to the Council to \nshow leadership in response to international crises. \nMembership of the Council is a privilege for any State, \nand Ireland has been honoured to serve on it on a \nnumber of occasions. \n\nBut the permanent members of the Security \nCouncil have a special responsibility to work together \nin a way that enables the United Nations to live up \nto the commitments made in its Charter. When the \nUnited Nations fails, or delays action, we are all the \npoorer for such setbacks. But when the United Nations \nworks, we can achieve great things together. And \nthose successes, such as the definition of a post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda, should serve as an inspiration \nand a springboard for the international community\u2019s \nresponses to the other great challenges of our time.\n"

        "file_text": "It is an \nhonour for the United Nations to act everywhere where \nthe freedom of peoples is denied. It is an honour for \nthe United Nations to act where fundamental rights are \ncompromised. It is an honour for the United Nations to \nintervene where extremism threatens the security of the \nworld. It is an honour for the United Nations to act on \nbehalf of peace.\n\nIn Syria, the situation is becoming urgent because \n120,000 people have died over the past two and a half \nyears \u2014 90,000 in the past year alone. One-fourth of \nthe population is displaced. Millions of Syrians have \nbecome refugees and the country has been destroyed. \nThe worst happened on 21 August in Damascus, \nwhen chemical weapons were used against civilians, \nincluding women and children. United Nations \ninspectors, sent officially on behalf of the Organization \nhave, established unequivocally and with certainty the \nuse of these weapons. \n\nIn the face of this horrifying crime, France sought a \nstrong reaction to punish this violation of international \nlaw and to dissuade Bashir Al-Assad\u2019s regime from \ncommitting new massacres. This pressure exerted by \nmy country, along with others, in particular the United \nStates, has seen some initial results. Negotiations are \nunder way as we speak to ensure the verification and \ndestruction of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons. \n\nHowever, if these negotiations are to attain their \nultimate end, I have set out three requirements. The \nfirst is that any text must clearly make it possible for \nthe Security Council to become seized of this issue of \n\n\n\f\nchemical weapons at any given moment. The second \nrequirement is that the draft resolution we are preparing \nprovides for coercive measures under Chapter VII in \nthe event that the Syrian regime fails to respect its \ncommitments. Since the agreement signed between the \nUnited States and Russia has the same provision, that is \nall the more reason to include it in the draft resolution. \nThe third requirement is that those who have committed \nthese crimes must be held accountable before justice. \n\nBut we cannot limit ourselves to this draft \nresolution, which must be adopted soon. We must \nend this war, the deadliest since the beginning of the \ncentury. The solution is political. Too much time has \nbeen squandered, and I will not refer again to the \nblocking of action in the Security Council. During this \nperiod, not only has the regime increased its violence, \nbut terrorist groups have also taken advantage of the \ninternational community\u2019s inertia, to the detriment of \nthe democratic forces found within the Syrian National \nCoalition. \n\nThis is why the \u201cGeneva II\u201d conference must be \nheld as soon as possible. For France, however, Geneva \nII is not just a talk shop. It must be a conference to \ndefine the objective for putting in place a transitional \nGovernment with full executive powers, mandated to \nre-establish civil peace, to protect all communities and \nto organize elections in due time. I am sometimes asked \nabout participants in this conference. My response is \nsimple. All countries \u2014 and I repeat, all countries \u2014 that \naccept the goal of installing a transitional Government \nand clearly acknowledge their commitment to a political \nsolution will be welcome at the conference. \n\nOf equal urgency is the humanitarian situation. In \nSyria, the displaced are in the millions, and there are \nnow more than 1.5 million refugees in Turkey, Jordan \nand Lebanon. The prolongation of the crisis poses \na direct threat to the unity and security of Lebanon, \nnearly 20 per cent of whose population is now of Syrian \norigin. \n\nI would like to thank Secretary-General Ban \nKi-moon for having organized the first meeting of the \nInternational Support Group for Lebanon. France is \ncommitted to that country because we know how much \nit has suffered in recent years from disturbances in the \nMiddle East and how much it needs to be supported \ntoday in its efforts to host refugees.\n\nThere are serious concerns in that part of the \nMiddle East, but there are also glimmers of hope. \nThe first is the resumption of negotiations between \nthe Israelis and the Palestinians. Only that will enable \npeace to be achieved. It requires the coexistence of \ntwo States, both with safe and recognized borders. \nWe must do everything to ensure that the opportunity \nthat now exists for Israelis, Palestinians and the entire \nregion is seized to finally bring an end to a conflict that \nwhose regional and international repercussions are well \nknown to us all. Negotiating peace between Israel and \nPalestine would be an historic act.\n\nThe second glimmer of hope is found in the \nstatements of the new Iranian President, which reflect \nan evolution. I will not exaggerate them, but the question \nnow is to know whether those words will be translated \ninto actions, in particular concerning the nuclear \nissue. For the past 10 years, our discussions have not \nprogressed, leading the the international community \nto adopt increasingly severe sanctions. The situation \nis dangerous, as we all know. Therefore, France \nexpects from Iran concrete gestures reflecting that \ncountry\u2019s renunciation its military nuclear programme, \nalthough it clearly retains the right to pursue its civilian \nprogramme. That is why I have chosen to engage in \ndirect and open dialogue with President Rouhani. I will \nalso say from this rostrum that while I am in favour of \ndialogue, I remain firm on the serious issue of nuclear \nproliferation.\n\nThe Middle East is not the only region of the \nworld that is of concern to us. Africa has fallen prey to \nterrorism, and the barbaric attack in Nairobi confirms \nthat to us once again, tragically. Victories are possible \nagainst terrorism. In Mali, with the clear mandate of \nthe Security Council, African and French forces, with \nthe support of Europe, intervened in response to the \nappeal of the authorities in Bamako and brought an end \nto a broad terrorist offensive. Today we see the results. \nMali has regained its territorial integrity. It has ensured \nthe security of its population, and it has even been able \nto hold, on the scheduled date, a presidential election \nthat has been recognized as incontestable. I welcome \nthe new President of Mali, Mr. Ibrahim Boubacar .eita. \nHis election is evidence of a great victory for West \nAfrica against terrorism.\n\nHowever, the threat continues to weigh heavily on \nthe Sahel and in Libya, where weapons are uniquitous \nand where terrorist groups have found refuge. We must \nassist the Libyan authorities to ensure the security \nof their territory and of their population. France is \nprepared to do so.\n\n\n\f\nI would like to sound an alarm, as I did last year \nwith respect to Mali. The warning here is about the \nCentral African Republic \u2014 a small country that has \nbeen ravaged by coups and conflicts for years. Today, \nchaos has taken root and civilians are yet again its \nvictims. We must bring an end to the abuse, which is \nalso sectarian in nature. That is why I would like the \nSecurity Council to issue a mandate and provide the \nlogistical and financial means to create an African \nforce, with its first mission to re-establish stability in \nthe Central African Republic.\n\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, women \nand children are victims of violence every day in the \nKivu region. Again, it is essential that we continue \nto strengthen the United Nations Organization \nStabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo, to implement the Addis Ababa agreement, and \nto reject all external interference.\n\nWe must learn from the experience of recent years. \nEverywhere chaos reigns, terrorism takes root and \ngrows. That is the case in Somalia, and the horrific \nattack against Kenya reminds us that Al-Shaabab-\naffiliated groups, while they have been defeated, have \nnot yet been eradicated. That is why the international \ncommunity must help African States to protect \nthemselves.\n\nFrance will convene, late this year, a meeting on \npeace and security in Africa. France has invited all \nAfrican countries; Europe will be represented, as will \nthe United Nations. The purpose of the meeting is to \nenable the establishment, training and equipping of \nAfrican armies to ensure the security of the continent \nand combat all traffickers, particularly drug traffickers, \nand piracy. Africans themselves must ensure their \nsecurity, but we cannot leave them to face the terrorist \nthreat alone. \n\nThe best weapons we have are our development \npolicies, because poverty, unemployment and inequality \nprovide fertile soil for violence and insecurity. Again, \nFrance calls for the mobilization of the international \ncommunity through new funds that we must create to \nfinance the necessary infrastructures and to enable \naccess to essential public services.\n\nFrance is fighting, along with Europe, for the \nintroduction of innovative financing. My country\u2019s tax \non airline tickets, which helps finance the International \nDrug Purchase Facility (UNITAID), has brought in \nmore than \u20ac1 billion since 2006. My country has decided \nto increase that tax by a further 10 per cent to enhance \nour fight against the great pandemics: HIV/AIDS, \ntuberculosis and malaria. With Europe, France has \nalso established a tax on financial transactions. I have \ndecided to allocate 10 per cent of that income towards \nsuch development-related actions as access to water \nand renewable energy, because with development \nassistance we can help the poorest countries to ensure \ntheir future, and thereby their security, and to respond \nto global warming, which concerns us all.\n\nFrance is available to host the 2015 climate \nconference. This matter, too, respresents a threat to \nour own security, because one report after another \nstates that if we do nothing, by the end of this century \nthe temperature of the planet will have increased by \nthree or four degrees Centigrade, with the well-known \nconsequences of flooding in some places, droughts in \nothers. Those direct threats would in turn endanger \npeace throughout the world. We must therefore seek an \nagreement at the 2015 climate conference.\n\nThe foundations of the commitment are well known. \nThe agreement must be equitable. Each country must do \nits part. The developed countries obviously must make \nhe greatest effort. Emerging countries must protect their \ndevelopment, but they must also understand that they \nare directly threatened by global warming. The least \ndeveloped countries, those that are the most fragile and \nvulnerable, must be aided in the transition. That is the \npurpose of the fund that was created in Durbin. The \nagreement must also be binding; it cannot simply be a \nreiteration of principles. It cannot simply be wording in \nresolutions that are not translated into concrete actions. \nIf there is no assessment and there are no sanctions, \nthere will be no progress and global temperature will \ninexorably rise.\n\nMy message is simple. In any domain, whether \ninternational security, nuclear proliferation, \ndevelopment or climate change, the worst threat is \ninaction, the worst decision is to take no decision, \nand the worst danger is to not see any. And the United \nNations bears the responsibility to act. Each time the \nOrganization appears powerless, peace is the first \nvictim. That is why I am proposing that the permanent \nmembers of the Security Council define a code of \nconduct such that in cases of mass crimes, they may \ncollectively decide to renounce the right of veto.\n\nIt is also my hope to see the Secretary-General\u2019s \npowers of inquiry strengthened to enable the United \nNations to ensure \u2014 as it has done in Syria \u2014 that \n\n\n\f\nthe truth is established in all instances, carry out \ninvestigations and act on the results. The Assembly has \nthe sovereign right to take such a decision. Our credibility \ndepends upon our capacity to intervene quickly and \neffectively in ensuring respect for international law, \npunishing violations and promoting development to \npreserve future generations. Our legitimacy flows \nfrom the Charter of the United Nations. We must be \nworthy of it. Within that framework, France will always \nassume its responsibilities in all domains.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me at \nthe outset to convey to President Ashe the heartfelt \ncongratulations of the delegation of Mali on his election \nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\neighth session. His election is quite clearly a recognition \nof his qualities as a seasoned diplomat, as well as a \ntribute to his country, Antigua and Barbuda. He may be \nassured of the full readiness of my delegation to work \nto ensure the successful outcome of our efforts.\n\nI should like to take this opportunity also to \ncongratulate his predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremi. of \nSerbia, for the outstanding manner in which he led the \nwork of the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. Allow \nme also to reiterate to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \nKi-moon, our deepest appreciation for the praiseworthy \nefforts he has made to achieve the lofty objectives of \nour Organization.\n\nA few weeks after my accession to Mali\u2019s highest \noffice as the third elected President of the Republic \nsince the advent of democracy, it is for me a badge of \nhonour to address the Assembly.\n\nAt the outset, let me assure the Assembly of my \nunshakeable determination to defend the ideals of our \nOrganization, which are based on the values of peace, \nsecurity, justice and development, all values contained \nin the oath that I swore to the people of Mali.\n\nI come here before the Assembly to express the \ngratitude of my people to the whole of the international \ncommunity for the invaluable support it showed to my \ncountry, Mali, which today has recovered its sovereignty \nover the whole of its territory. From this lofty rostrum, \nand on behalf of all the people of Mali, I pay tribute to \nthe work of the United Nations, and especially to the \nSecurity Council, which through four resolutions and a \nnumber of statements condemned the jihadist terrorist \naggression suffered by my country and reaffirmed its \nattachment to the unity and territorial integrity of my \ncountry. The Council authorized the deployment of \ninternational forces to assist the armed forces of Mali in \nthe difficult task of recovering the areas of its territory \nthat were controlled by terrorist groups.\n\nAllow me to convey my gratitude to UNESCO \nfor formally condemning the destruction of the \nglobal heritage sites and mausoleums in Timbuktu \nand Gao. At that time, Morocco was President of the \nSecurity Council. I would therefore like to thank His \nMajesty King Mohammed VI for the very significant \ncontributions made by the Kingdom of Morocco, which \nright from the start of the occupation of Mali condemned \nthe act of aggression to which we had fallen victim, and \noffered our people emergency humanitarian assistance. \nThis is also the right time and place to thank France \nand its President, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, for launching \nOperation Serval, a life-saving operation, that halted \nthe advance of jihadists towards the south of Mali. Had \nit not been for that intervention, I would not be standing \nhere before the Assembly today.\n\nAllow me to also convey my gratitude to the \nEconomic Community of West African States \n(ECOWAS), the African Union and to the Organization \nof Islamic Cooperation for their concern and continuing \n\n\n\f\ncommitment to seeking a lasting solution to the Malian \ncrisis. In particular, I would like to commend the \nleadership of Mr. Alassane Ouattara, President of the \nRepublic of C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire and current President of \nECOWAS, for his ongoing commitment to supporting \nthe Malian people. I also thank President Blaise \nCompaor\u00e9 of Burkina Faso, mediator during the Malian \ncrisis, as well as Mr. Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria, \nco-mediator during the crisis, for their ongoing efforts \naimed at finding a solution to the crisis that struck our \ncountry. We also thank President Boni Yayi of Benin, \nwho during his mandate as head of the African Union \ndevoted all his energy to resolving the Malian crisis.\n\nI would also like to thank the President of Chad, \nour brother Idriss Deby Itno. His country deployed \n2,000 men in Mali, many of whom died. Our thoughts \nand sympathy are with all the sons and daughters of \nChad who died in Mali. They sacrificed their lives \nfor Mali. I would also like to pay tribute to President \nMahamadou Issoufou and the brave people of the Niger \nfor extending a fraternal welcome to our people, which \neased a great deal of suffering. I would also like to take \nthis opportunity to pay my respects to the memory of \nall of our Nigerien brothers who died in the battlefields \nduring savage attacks on Agadez and Arlit in the Niger.\n\nI also pay tribute to the President of Algeria, \nMr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, and to our brothers the \npeople of Algeria, who have always stood by Mali. \nThere is a long-standing history of friendship between \nour peoples, something that was confirmed again when \nAlgeria recently helped Mali during the humanitarian \ncrisis. I would like to take this opportunity to state that \nAlgeria and Mali are two brotherly States. They are \nlinked by a solid friendship and a shared history.\n\nTo the people of Mauritania and President \nMohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, I would like to express \nmy gratitude for their troops, who stood by us in our \npursuit of the jihadists who ran amok in the north of \nMali for so long. To Mauritania, which has also been in \nmourning because of jihadist attacks, I would also like \nto extend our heartfelt condolences and our sympathy \nto those who perished fighting for our country. Many \nof our Mauritanian friends and brothers died in the \nTimbuktu region.\n\nFinally, to the European Union and all bilateral and \nmultilateral partners, I would like to say that the people \nof Mali are grateful for the wonderful international \nmobilization to help our country, which enabled us to \novercome the crisis, making it possible for me to stand \nhere today. I also believe that the restoration of peace \nin Mali today allows us to look to the future in a calm, \nreasonable and confident way. Furthermore, I would \nlike to assure them that the fight against drug traffickers \nand jihadists, in all their guises, is an ongoing struggle, \none to which we are committed. I thank you very much \nfor standing by us in this continuing fight.\n\nI would like to extend my heartfelt thoughts to all \nthose friends of Mali who perished on the battlefields \nto safeguard the future of our country and the future \nof our children. There were many heroes, anonymous \ncivilians, men and women alike, who suffered in Mali. \nOur thoughts are with all the injured, the women who \nwere raped, those who were maimed, those who suffered \nunder the yoke of barbarity, enduring endless months of \nsuffering yet remaining steadfast, standing up for Mali \ndespite all the intimidation rained down upon them.\n\nIt would be heartless of me to move on without \na thought of compassion for all the families of the \nAlgerian, French and other hostages still held by jihadist \ngroups in the Sahel region, including northern Mali. I \ncan assure the Assembly that we will spare no effort in \nworking to speed up their release, in close cooperation \nwith the States concerned, of course.\n\nMali is back. Yes indeed, with the support of \nfriendly States, Mali stands tall, ready to turn a page \non the darkest periods of its history, one marked by \nnine months of grave human rights violations, looting, \nthe destruction of unique historical and cultural \nmonuments and sites, and its cultural heritage. Mali has \nrecovered its sovereignty and national integrity, backed \nby its cultural diversity, and now is setting off on the \npath towards national reconciliation.\n\nA process of dialogue for peace and national \nreconciliation has been launched through the \npreliminary Ouagadougou Agreement signed on \n18 June. The transition, which was launched in March \n2012, following the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, ended last August, \nfollowing presidential elections that were deemed \ncredible and transparent by the entire international \ncommunity. Through that exemplary election process, \nMalians recalled and demonstrated their commitment \nto democracy and constitutional order. To finalize that \nprocess, my Government has made a commitment to \nholding, without any further delays, the first round of \nlegislative elections on 24 November and the second \nround on 15 December.\n\n\n\f\nAs a President who enjoys the trust and confidence \nof the Malian people, I understand the huge scope of the \nchallenges. Malians have a deep-seated yearning for \npeace and national reconciliation, as well as economic \nand social development. As soon as I became President, \nI took the initiative to meet with the heads of armed \ngroups from the north of the country in Bamako to \nremind them of the sacrosanct principles of respect for \nthe territorial integrity of Mali and the secular nature \nof our State. I made them aware of our readiness to \norganize candid, inclusive political dialogue where \neverything, except for any form of independence or \nautonomy, could be discussed openly. Our message \nhas been heard, and we will commit to dialogue in the \nfuture in order to find a lasting solution to the crisis in \nnorthern Mali.\n\nAt this point, we would like to revive the inter- and \nintracommunitarian dialogue to recreate conditions \nconducive to enabling all Malians to live together. A \ngeneral meeting for decentralization will be convened \nto create the conditions necessary for an effective \ntransfer of governance and resources to local authorities \nthroughout the country. Thereafter, the Government \nwill hold a national review conference on the north of \nMali.\n\nIn preparing for future decisions with the armed \ngroups and in order to create the conditions for pacifying \nthe situation, confidence-building measures have been \ntaken, as called for in the preliminary Ouagadougou \nAgreement. In that connection, it is hard to understand \nwhy the rebel elements have decided to suspend \nnegotiations, which represents a flagrant violation of \nthe Agreement. We will have to discuss that. In that \nregard, the Dialogue and Reconciliation Commission \nwill be turned into a commission for dialogue on truth \nand reconciliation to deal with the remaining wounds of \nwar within Malian society.\n\nThe cyclical crisis in the northern regions of Mali \nis rooted in the precarious living conditions of the local \npopulation and poverty. I established the Ministry \nfor National Reconciliation and Development of the \nNorthern Regions upon my arrival at the helm in \norder to accelerate development in the areas of health, \neducation and infrastructure.\n\nI am pleased to note that the international \ncommunity has understood what is at stake, and I \ntake this opportunity to express my deep-seated \nand heartfelt gratitude to all the friends of Mali who \ncommitted themselves on 15 May, in a wonderful show \nof exceptional solidarity to backing the implementation \nof the plan for the sus,tainable economic recovery of \nMali.\n\nWith the support of the international community, \nMali is working resolutely to address peacebuilding, \nnational reconciliation and the reform of the national \ndefence and security forces, to rebuild the northern \nregions devastated by the terrorist and jihadist forces, \nto improve institutional governance and to launch \nthe economic recovery of our country. Within the \nframework of good governance, pride of place has been \ngiven to our national justice system. After the Prime \nMinister, the Minister of Justice is the most senior \nMinister in my Government, which clearly shows our \ndedication to turning Mali into a State where the rule \nof law truly prevails.\n\nMali has come a long way, but it has arrived. It \nis here and it wishes to play its full role. However, \nthe situation that our country is facing, I must say, is \nsymptomatic of the challenges that all the countries \nof the Sahel region are facing, including the worst \npossible forms of transnational organized crime, \nincluding trafficking in drugs, human beings and \nweapons of all kinds, of which some very sophisticated \ntypes have come from the Libyan arsenals since the \nfall of the Al-Qadhafi regime. Despite the hope raised \nfollowing the successful military operations through \nthe combined efforts of Operation Serval, the troops \nof the African-led International Support Mission \nin Mali, now the United Nations Multidimensional \nIntegrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, and Malian \narmed security forces, small armed terrorist groups \ncontinue to make themselves felt in our subregion and \nto move from one territory to another \u2014 we know \nthat they are present in the southern territory of one \nof our neighbours \u2014 which represents for us and \nthe international community a serious threat to the \nstability and territorial integrity of Mali and to peace \nand security in the Sahel region as a whole.\n\nIt is in that context that the United Nations Mission \nfor the stabilization of Mali was deployed. That Mission \nwas successful, and we wish to congratulate the United \nNations, especially the Security Council, for that \noutstanding initiative.\n\nOur country stands at a crossroads. Just a few \nmonths ago, no one could have thought that I would \nstand in this Hall before the General Assembly. I take \nthis opportunity to reiterate our commitment to working \nunstintingly for the implementation of the United \n\n\n\f\nNations strategy for the Sahel region. We familiarized \nourselves with the strategy yesterday at a high-level \nsummit on the situation in the Sahel. As a result of the \ncomplexity and seriousness of the situation in the Sahel, \nmy delegation welcomes the report presented in June \nby Mr. Romano Prodi, Special Envoy of the Secretary- \nGeneral (S/2013/354), which we believe accurately \nreflects the regional dimension and should enable us \nto extricate ourselves from the situation prevailing \nthroughout our country.\n\nThis is the right time for me to forcefully underscore \nthat finding a lasting solution to the Sahel crisis will \nrequire a strengthened and dynamic cooperation \nbetween all the States in the Sahel and Saharan regions \nto fight against religious extremism and organized \ncrime. Under my leadership, Mali is determined to work \nto give a new impetus to the subregional cooperation \nmechanisms that we have. In that regard, the assistance \nof the international community will be indispensable \nin the fight against transnational terrorism in the Sahel \nregion as a whole.\n\nThe stakes are high and the terrorist threat is of \nalarming proportions, to the point that no country is safe \nfrom violent and barbarous acts. The attacks that took \nplace in Nairobi, Kenya, are the most painful examples \nof that. My country, which is slowly recovering from \nthe atrocities carried out by jihadist terrorist groups \nand the allied drug trafficking groups, reiterates its \nfirm condemnation of terrorism of all stripes and in \nall its manifestations. On behalf of Mali, I present \nmy most deep-seated and heartfelt condolences to the \nGovernment and the people of our brother country, \nKenya.\n\nThe delegation of Mali is particularly gratified by \nthe central theme of the general debate of the sixty-\neighth session of the General Assembly, \u201cThe post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage\u201d. The relevance \nof that theme lies in the uncertainties being faced by the \nworld today, uncertainties resulting from economic and \nfinancial instability at the international level, from an \naccentuation of the scourge of poverty, the continued \ndeterioration of the environment and the increase in the \nnumber of natural disasters. Just a few months ago, we \nsuffered flooding that claimed at least 50 lives in my \ncountry alone.\n\nIndeed, 10 years after the adoption of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), the Heads \nof State and Government gathered here at the General \nAssembly in September 2010 in the framework of a \nmid-term review and expressed their serious concerns \nabout the insufficient results. It is clear at this point that \nthe path to be travelled to achieve the MDGs remains \na lengthy one. In that regard, it is crucial that we cast \na critical glance at the shortcomings noted in order to \npave the way for sustainable development.\n\nOne shortcoming of the MDG programme that \ncaught our attention was the lack of commitment \nregarding MDG 8, on the setting up a global partnership \nfor development. Without setting up open and equitable \nfinancial and trade systems that would respect the \npromises made to least developed countries, small island \nStates and landlocked States \u2014 our Samoan colleague \nhas just referred to that \u2014 and faced with a shortfall of \nassistance to those countries, we run the risk of failing. \nFaced with that situation, Mali encourages the adoption \nof a unique consolidated development programme for \nthe post-2015 period whose priority objective will, \nin the long run, be the eradication of poverty and the \npromotion of economic, social and environmental \nsustainability. That is a vision that has resulted from \nthe pressing nature of the challenges and the shortage \nof resources available to deal with them.\n\nIn line with my predecessors, I would like to \nreaffirm here and now my firm determination to defend \nthe ideals of peace, security and justice that mark the \nOrganization. In Africa, Mali is extremely concerned \nabout the situation in the Central African Republic, the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt and Libya, \nand expresses its firm condemnation of violence as \na means of political expression. Mali welcomes the \nprogress achieved on the path of reconstruction and \nnational reconciliation in Liberia, Sierra Leone and \nGuinea-Bissau.\n\nWith respect to the Middle East, we remain \nconcerned by the ongoing deadly violence in Syria, with \nits daily lot of humanitarian disasters. Accordingly, we \ncondemn with the utmost firmness the use of chemical \nweapons in the country. Mali urges all parties to favour \nnegotiated political solutions under the auspices of the \nUnited Nations.\n\nWe encourage the Israeli-Palestinian talks currently \nunder way and urge all parties to take the steps \nnecessary to establish a climate of trust and launch \ndirect negotiations to achieve a just, comprehensive \nand lasting peace based, in particular, on the relevant \nGeneral Assembly and Security Council resolutions. I \n\n\n\f\ntake this opportunity to reiterate the solidarity and full \nsupport of the people and the Government of Mali for \nthe Palestinian people in their legitimate struggle for \nthe exercise of their inalienable right to sovereignty.\n\nI welcome the measures taken in recent years by \nthe United Nations to bring about qualitative changes in \nthe priority fields of development, peace and collective \nsecurity, as well as human rights, and to reform the \nOrganization. Despite the progress achieved, much \nremains to be done, especially concerning the necessary \nreform of the Security Council and the revitalization of \nthe General Assembly. We must continue our efforts to \nensure that the General Assembly, the main deliberative \norgan of the Organization, occupies a central position, \nwith the means to implement its resolutions.\n\nTurning now to the reform of the Security Council, \nMali reiterates its commitment to the Ezulwini \nConsensus and the Sirte Declaration adopted by the \nheads of State and Government of the African Union, \nand supports the legitimate demands by Africa to have \ntwo permanent seats and five non-permanent seats in \nthe Security Council.\n\nThe Security Council thus reformed would better \nreflect the geopolitical realities of today\u2019s world and \nwould repair the \u201chistorical injustice\u201d done to Africa, \nthe only region of the world that does not have a \npermanent seat on the Council.\n\nMali is back. Mali now takes back its place, its \nrightful place in keeping with its rich history, in the \ncommunity of free and democratic States. The Malian \npeople stand ready to take part, to play a full-fledged \nrole in building a world of peace, tolerance, freedom, \njustice and democracy. Malians remain convinced that \nit is along that path that we, the leaders of the world, \nwill lay the milestones of sustainable development \nfor our peoples and will spare present and future \ngenerations the scourge of war. That is our mission and, \nGod willing, we will accomplish it.\n"

        "file_text": "I stand \nhere today before the Assembly, soon after my country \nhas seen a new dawn. I come to this Hall in all humility \nas the elected Prime Minister of Pakistan for the third \ntime. I feel exonerated, as my supporters and I have \nstood firm in our commitment to democracy.\n\nI am happy to inform representatives that we now \nhave a strong Parliament, an independent judiciary, \na free media and a vibrant civil society. But there \nis no room for complacency. We cannot lower our \nguard. Democracy needs constant vigilance and \nstrong institutions. It needs careful nurturing. More \nimportantly, it is not promises but good governance that \nsustains democracy. My Government has put the people \nat the centre. We will work to give them peace and \nsecurity, an environment of growth and development. I \nam pursuing an inclusive approach for the entire nation.\n\nPakistan is an ardent supporter of the United \nNations, which is an anchor of peace and a beacon \nof hope for all nations. The United Nations universal \ncharacter provides a forum to discuss, develop and \nimplement global responses to the pressing problems \nof our times. Pakistan upholds international law and \npromotes international consensus. The security of our \nworld is ensured and reinforced by friendly relations \namong nations and respect for the sovereignty and the \nterritorial integrity of States.\n\nThe United Nations needs reform, but it should \nbe a reform that reflects the interests of all, not \njust the ambitions of a few. We believe that the \nSecurity Council\u2019s composition should be made more \nrepresentative, democratic and equitable, and its work \nmore effective, transparent and accountable. The \nintended reforms must, however, plan for a dynamic \nfuture, not entrench or replicate outdated historical \npatterns based on privileges. The role and authority \nof the General Assembly must be fully restored and \nrevitalized. In the past few years, the General Assembly \nhas regained influence in responding to challenges in \nregard to peace and security, development and climate \nchange. It is becoming a platform of choice. Yet, it has \nto go a long way to acquire its full authority.\n\nTo save the world from the scourge of war, we have \nto continue to strive for a fair and just international \norder based on the rule of law. Festering disputes must \nbe resolved. In that regard, the United Nations has to \nplay a critical role.\n\nThe United Nations must, for instance, continue to \nremain attentive to the issue of Jammu and Kashmir \nand the full realization of the right to self-determination \nof its people. The suffering of the people cannot be \nbrushed under the carpet because of power politics. \nAs in the past, Pakistan calls upon the international \ncommunity to give an opportunity to the Kashmiris \nto decide their future peacefully, in accordance with \nthe relevant Security Council resolutions. The issue \nof Jammu and Kashmir was presented to the Security \nCouncil in January 1948, and yet the issue remains \nunresolved after nearly seven decades.\n\nI have aspirations for regional peace and \nstability. I have shared that vision with leaders in \nour neighbourhood. Shortly after assuming office, \nI received a message of goodwill from the Prime \nMinister of India, Mr. Manmohan Singh. I extended an \ninvitation to him to engage with us so as to address \nall outstanding issues between our two countries, \nand Prime Minister Singh\u2019s response was positive. \nOur two countries have wasted massive resources \nin an arms race. We could have used those resources \nfor the economic well-being of our people. We still \nhave that opportunity. Pakistan and India can prosper \ntogether; and the entire region would benefit from our \ncooperation. We stand ready to re-engage with India \nin a substantive and purposeful dialogue. I am looking \nforward to meeting Prime Minister Singh here in \nNew York so as to make a new beginning. We have a \nsolid basis for doing that. We can build on the Lahore \nAccord signed in 1999, which contained a road map \nfor the resolution of our differences through peaceful \nnegotiations. I am committed to working for a peaceful \nand economically prosperous region. That is what our \npeople want and what I have long aspired to.\n\nIt gave me great pleasure to welcome President \nKarzai in Islamabad last month. We reaffirmed our \nshared goal of a peaceful, stable and united Afghanistan. \nThe people of Afghanistan are and should remain \nmasters of their own destiny. We support an inclusive, \nAfghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process, leading \n\n\n\f\nto national reconciliation. I assured President Karzai \nthat we do not wish to interfere in Afghanistan\u2019s internal \naffairs; nor do we have any favourites in that country. \nIn fact, we hope earnestly that the Afghans themselves \nwill unite for the peace, prosperity and development of \ntheir great country.\n\nPakistan encourages United Nations efforts to \nstabilize Afghanistan. We will work together with \nAfghanistan for regional and economic cooperation \naimed at establishing and reinforcing regional trade, \nenergy and communications corridors. Our solidarity \nwith the Afghan people has been demonstrated through \nour willingness to host millions of Afghan refugees in \nPakistan for many decades. International support for \ntheir repatriation to and reintegration in Afghanistan is \nindispensable. We also look forward to United Nations \nsupport for addressing other transregional challenges, \nincluding the flow of narcotics.\n\nLast year, the Assembly gave Palestine the status of \nnon-Member observer State. We hope that it will soon \njoin this body as a full Member State. We are glad that \nthe stalled peace process has started again. It should \nlead to the consolidation of an independent, viable and \ncontiguous State of Palestine, based on the pre-1967 \nborders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. Pakistan \nwill continue to demonstrate its solidarity with the \npeople of Palestine.\n\nEven as we meet here, Syria is in turmoil, with \nSyrians killing Syrians. We appeal to the Syrian \nGovernment and the opposition groups to move to \nthe negotiating table in Geneva to prepare a road map \nfor national reconciliation and the necessary political \ntransitions. More war will lead to more killings, \nwhich must be stopped. As a party to the Convention \non the Prohibition of the Development, Production, \nStockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on \nTheir Destruction, Pakistan remains opposed to the \nuse of chemical weapons. We condemn their use in the \nstrongest terms.\n\nWe welcome the agreement reached between the \nUnited States and Russia, and supported by the other \npermanent members of the Security Council, to secure \nand destroy chemical weapons in Syria. That crucial \nstep has facilitated consensus within the Council to \nadopt resolution 2118 (2013), which not only addresses \nthe issue of chemical weapons but could start the \nstalled political process in Syria, leading to national \nreconciliation and solutions that are acceptable to the \npeople of Syria. Pakistan will support that resolution. \nAcceptance of the Geneva communiqu\u00e9 (S/2012/522, \nannex) and a decision on dates for convening a Geneva \nII conference will be a big step towards ending the crisis \nin Syria. I call on all forces to invest their political will \nand capital in diplomacy to bring peace to that country.\n\nAs a responsible nuclear-weapon State, we will \ncontinue to pursue the goals of disarmament and \nnon-proliferation and adhere to a policy of credible \nminimum deterrence without entering into any arms \nrace. We cannot, however, remain oblivious to the \nevolving security dynamics in South Asia, nor can \nwe agree to an arrangement that is detrimental to our \nsecurity and strategic interests. Our position on the \nproposed fissile material treaty is determined by our \nnational security interests and the objective of strategic \nstability in South Asia.\n\nThe safe, secure and peaceful use of nuclear energy, \nwithout discrimination, is essential for economic \ndevelopment. Pakistan qualifies for full access to civil \nnuclear technology for peaceful purposes in order to \nmeet its growing energy needs for continued economic \ngrowth. By the same token, as a mainstream partner \nin the global non-proliferation regime, Pakistan has \nimpeccable credentials for joining the multilateral \nexport control regime, including the Nuclear \nSuppliers Group. Pakistan will continue to participate \nconstructively in the Nuclear Security Summit, which \nis a laudable initiative.\n\nAs a country that has suffered grievously for many \nyears from terrorism, we condemn that phenomenon in \nall its forms and manifestations. Over the past 12 years, \nwe have made huge sacrifices in blood and resources. \nWe have lost 40,000 precious lives of men, women \nand children, including 8,000 defence and security \npersonnel. There has been colossal damage to our social \nand physical infrastructure, too. Our economy has \nbeen denied the opportunity to grow fully. That must \nchange now. I have tried to forge national consensus on \na cohesive policy to eliminate terrorism from our soil. \nFor that purpose, I convened an all-parties conference \nthat spoke out unanimously against terrorism. We are \nresolved to oppose the forces of terrorism with every \nmeans at our disposal. At the same time, we have offered \ndialogue to end violence, wean young extremists off \nextremism and integrate all segments of our society \ninto the national mainstream. Winning young people\u2019s \nhearts and minds is as important as using guns to deter \nterrorism. But dialogue should not be seen as a sign of \nweakness or a tool of appeasement.\n\n\n\f\nThe war against terrorism must be waged within the \nframework of international law. The use of armed drones \nin the border areas of Pakistan is a continued violation \nof our territorial integrity. It results in innocent civilian \ncasualties and is detrimental to our resolve and efforts \nto eliminate extremism and terrorism in Pakistan. I \nhave urged the United States to cease those strikes so \nthat we can avoid further casualties and suffering.\n\nTerrorism knows no borders. It has no religion \nor creed, which is why maligning a whole people or \na religion on that account is unfair and unwise. Islam \nis a religion of peace, compassion and brotherhood. \nAnd the yet most insidious form of contemporary \nracism in the name of religion is on the rise. Peaceful \nMuslim communities are profiled and subjected to \ndiscriminatory practices. Their faith, culture, holy \npersonalities and scriptures are under attack. The \nstereotyping of Muslims as extremists and terrorists \nmust stop. We must all use the influence and reach \nof the United Nations to avert a clash of civilizations \nand to promote harmony among followers of diverse \nreligions all around the world. Terrorism negates \nIslam\u2019s humanistic outlook and noble values. Those \nwho perpetrate terrorism are enemies of Muslims and \nIslam itself.\n\nPakistan is the largest troop contributor to United \nNations peacekeeping. Since 1960, we have contributed \n150,000 troops, and 135 of our peacekeepers have lost \ntheir lives in the service of peace. That has been our \nmost tangible assistance to the United Nations efforts \nto maintain international peace and security.\n\nWe fully support the United Nations effort to \nfinalize and implement a single, coherent post-2015 \ndevelopment agenda that identifies benchmarks for \npoverty alleviation, sustainable development and \nsocial inclusion. More importantly, we should prepare \nourselves to respond effectively to save our planet from \nthe ravages of climate change.\n\nOur Government is undertaking an economic \nrevolution in Pakistan so that it, too, can become part of \nthe emerging markets. We have all the fundamentals and \nhuman and natural resources for such a transformation. \nIn the immediate future, our challenge is to overcome \na volatile security environment, correct structural \nimbalances in the economy and bring an end to energy \nshortages. We are building a new Pakistan with a robust \neconomy. From the international community, we seek \nnot aid but enhanced trade, market access, investment \nand strong economic partnerships.\n\nWe are creating a new framework for change \nto provide equal opportunities and social justice \nfor everyone, eliminate the exploitation of the poor, \nharness our human resources and restore the dignity \nof our citizens. We intend to use education as a key \ndriver of the socioeconomic development of Pakistan. \nWe are introducing a national health service across \nPakistan with the participation of the private sector. We \nhave also made the eradication of polio in Pakistan a \nmatter of great importance for my Government, as we \nare determined to make Pakistan a polio-free country.\n\nIt is our strong resolve to promote the full \nparticipation of women in national development, while \nprotecting their political, social and cultural rights as \nagents of change. More than 63 per cent of our population \nis under the age of 25. By investing in their education \nand skills, we aim to tap into the demographic dividend. \nMinorities are equal citizens of Pakistan. They will not \nonly have complete freedom to worship, but also full \nprotection of their rights to education, employment and \npolitical participation.\n\nWe are deeply saddened by the recent terrorist attack \non the members of a minority community in Peshawar. \nThat heinous attack has united the entire Pakistani \nnation in support of our brothers and sisters of all faiths \nin Pakistan. We share their grief and have declared \nthree days of mourning. The attack was carried out \nby the same elements who have attacked our mosques, \nshrines, innocent citizens and members of our security \nforces. However, the attack has further strengthened \nmy Government\u2019s resolve to deal with terrorism and \nextremism in a resolute and comprehensive manner, \nas I reiterated in my very first speech at the National \nAssembly of Pakistan.\n\nIn conclusion, I wish to emphasize to the Assembly \nthat Pakistan is a strong supporter of multilateral \ndiplomacy, convinced that it is the most legitimate and \nultimate guarantor of peace and security, economic and \nsocial development, and respect for universal human \nrights. As a non-permanent member of the Security \nCouncil, Pakistan has been making every effort to \nstrengthen the role of diplomacy to resolve conflicts \nand to help build States in post-conflict situations. In \nall instances, we have upheld the primacy of the Charter \nof the United Nations. We need multilateral diplomacy \nso that we continue to respect diversity while reaching \n\n\n\f\ndecisions that impact our fate as members of the \ninternational community. Towards that end, the United \nNations \u2014 the virtual world parliament \u2014 is our best \nhope.\n"

        "file_text": "It gives \nme great pleasure, at the outset, to extend my warmest \ncongratulations to the President and his friendly \ncountry, Antigua and Barbuda, on his election to the \npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth \nsession. We wish him every success in his endeavour \nand assure him that the Sultanate of Oman stands ready \nto cooperate with him and all delegations and Member \nStates to achieve the desired objectives.\n\nWe would like to take this opportunity to express \nour thanks and appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Vuk \nJeremi., of the friendly Republic of Serbia, for the \noutstanding manner in which he conducted the work \nof the previous session, as well as to thank Secretary-\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for all his efforts to enhance the \nrole of the Organization and develop its operational \nmechanisms to respond to current challenges and recent \ndevelopments and ensure optimal future preparedness.\n\nThe numerous achievements and successes of \nthe United Nations since its establishment, in 1945, \nhave contributed positively to increased security and \nstability in the world. However, the rapid developments \nwitnessed today, including steady population growth, \nrising global demand for energy and natural resources \nand tremendous advances in communications and \nnew technologies, have given rise to numerous \ndifficulties. Joint efforts and greater cooperation \namong Governments are required to address them and \nfind appropriate solutions. Such action requires that the \nOrganization and its various organs be empowered to \nstrengthen their capacity to respond to global demands \nand developments, with a sharp focus on vital and \nurgent issues.\n\nModernization, development and change constitute \nthe norms of life. However, they must go hand in hand \nwith increased security and stability, which should be \nbased on cooperation among all nations and should be \naimed at achieving sustainable development goals.\n\nThe recent events in various countries in the \nMiddle East resulted from genuine reactions to the \nsocioeconomic hardships faced by the peoples of the \nregion and to diminished institutional capacities to \nrespond fully to their needs and demands. Despite the \nloss of lives and property in those countries, current \nefforts are aimed at stability and restoring the economy, \nand as such deserve our support.\n\nMy country welcomes the consensus achieved in \nthe Security Council on the issue of chemical weapons \nin Syria and the unanimous adoption of resolution \n2118 (2013). The \u201cGeneva II\u201d conference is of critical \nimportance in facilitating negotiations between the \nSyrian Government and the opposition forces. We \nbelieve that the goal should be a ceasefire and the \nformation of a transitional authority with the necessary \npower to overcome the enormous difficulties resulting \nfrom a war that has been ongoing for approximately \nthree years.\n\nThe international community should prepare \nto provide support and humanitarian assistance to \ndisplaced Syrians and to all those affected by that \nabhorrent war. My country confirms its continued \nassistance to aid the displaced Syrians and expresses its \nreadiness to contribute to international humanitarian \naid inside Syrian territory.\n\nWe welcome the positive developments taking \nplace in Somalia thanks to the efforts of President \nHassan Sheikh Mohamud to rebuild the Somali State. \nIt is our hope that our brothers in the Federal Republic \n\n\n\f\nof Somalia will be able to implement the political \nand economic reform programme that has gained the \nsupport of the international community.\n\nAmong the important international issues that have \nyet to be resolved is the Palestinian question, which \nis considered the cornerstone of any possible peace \nin the Middle East. Despite the efforts made and the \nagreements concluded through direct negotiations \nbetween successive Israeli Governments and the \nPalestine Liberation Organization, no settlement has yet \nbeen reached. In that regard, my country supports the \nefforts of President Barack Obama and his Secretary of \nState, Mr. John Kerry, as they represent an opportunity \nfor all the peoples of the region to establish peace. \nThat would lead to economic and social development \nand revive the hope for peaceful coexistence among \nthe peoples of the region \u2014 all of which would ensure \na positive contribution by the Middle East to global \ncivilization.\n\nMy country continues to support the initiatives \naimed at transforming the Middle East into a zone \nfree of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction, as it is fully aware of the effects of those \nweapons on the security and stability of States, regions \nand the entire world.\n\nWith our emphasis on the right of States to \nbenefit from the peaceful use of nuclear energy, it is \nworth mentioning that the current dispute will not be \nresolved through coercive policies and practices, such \nas sanctions and other tough measures. Because those \nmeasures are limited, their effectiveness is weakened. \nRather, creative diplomacy can help all States to benefit \nfrom nuclear power for peaceful purposes.\n\nOn the other hand, we hope that the international \ncommunity, particularly the depositary countries of \nthe NPT, will be able to persuade other Middle Eastern \nStates to become parties to the Treaty and to subject \ntheir nuclear facilities to the comprehensive system \nof safeguards that exists under the supervision of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. That would \ncontribute to achieving the universality of the Treaty \nand would make the Middle East a zone free of nuclear \nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction. That \ngoal deserves the support of all countries, especially \nthe major Powers.\n\nWe express our regret at the non-convening of the \ninternational conference on the Middle East mandated \nby the decision of the 2010 Non-Proliferation Treaty \nReview Conference, owing to the fact that some \nparties did not support its convening. That reflects a \nlack of understanding of the conditions, objectives and \naspirations of the peoples of the Middle East region.\n\nIn the light of our commitment to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals, we would like to \nannounce that we have attained the Goals and all their \nindicators. In fact, we recently announced that we had \nbeen 100 per cent successful in achieving Goals 4 and \n5.\n\nWith regard to protection of the environment and \nnatural conservation, since the dawn of the renaissance \nled by His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said, my \ncountry, in line with the national strategy to protect the \nenvironment, has consistently integrated environmental \nissues into its plans and development goals, with a view \nto achieving a balance between the aims of sustainable \ndevelopment and the preservation of the environment.\n\nMy country has also sought to share its interests \nin the environment and natural conservation with \nthe international community. We have participated \nin many regional and international conferences on \nthe environment, including the eighteenth session of \nthe Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change, held \nin Qatar in December 2012. We look forward to \nparticipating in the nineteenth session, to be held in \nWarsaw in November.\n\nThe right to science and knowledge should be \nenjoyed by all humankind, and the great evolution \nin the use and application of modern technology has \nbecome an essential tool in our daily lives, thanks to \nscientific and intellectual creativity. Consequently, my \ncountry has sought to keep up with advances to meet \nour current needs. To that end, we have established \nmany centres and councils that encourage research \nand development, including the Scientific Research \nCouncil, the Industrial Innovation Centre, the National \nCentre for Enterprises and Commercial Activities, and \nthe Oasis of Knowledge. We also have a Middle East \nDesalination Research Centre.\n\nMy country continues to develop the main \nguidelines for a national strategy of research and \ndevelopment and scientific knowledge. We are also \ntrying to familiarize ourselves with modern technology \nand to encourage Omani youth to take part in different \nscience \u2014 and technology-based professions. In that \ncontext, we welcome future constructive cooperation, \n\n\n\f\ninvestment and partnerships with all other centres, \nuniversities, institutions and specialized industries \nin both the public and the private sectors and at the \nnational, regional and international levels. We also want \nto take advantage of Oman\u2019s geographical position as a \nmain gateway and bridge to knowledge and creativity \nin regional and international markets.\n\nIn conclusion, we wish the President every success \nat this session, and we hope that it concludes with a \nrealistic and renewed vision \u2014 an inspired vision and \none that also imparts new momentum for our times, a \nvision that reflects the aspirations of every generation \nand every people and makes every effort to achieve \nthem.\n"

        "file_text": "Allow me to first congratulate \nMr. John Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda on assuming \nthe presidency of the General Assembly at this session. \nMongolia pledges its full support to him.\n\nWe gather here at the United Nations to collectively \nassess the state of the world, share our thoughts and our \nvision, and agree on common actions. I shall begin by \nreviewing where we are today. \n\nOver 70 million people around the world join the \nmiddle class each year. The Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) have improved the lives of billions of \npeople. The world has attained poverty-reduction \ntargets \u2014 in some places, even ahead of the proscribed \ndeadline. Rather than seeing 2015 as the end, we should \nview it as the beginning of a new era. In this era, we \nshould build on our successes, attend to gaps and meet \nemerging challenges.\n\nSadly, we face many such challenges. Today, over \n200 million people are jobless, over 50 million children \nare not in school, and one in eight of our fellow citizens \nstill goes hungry. Yet over $900 billion dollars are \nearmarked for military expenditures every year. Only \na fraction of that sum is spent on health care and \neducation. Such a state of affairs should not be tolerated.\n\nWhen it comes to the climate, a temperature \nincrease of more than two degrees Centigrade would \nbe disastrous, if not catastrophic. Our environment \nis changing rapidly. On the production side, global \nconsumption far exceeds our fragile planet\u2019s capacity. \nResources are being exhausted. Humankind is gravely \nendangered. We are running out of time. The world has \ntoo many hungry people, too much violence and too \nlittle commitment to human rights. We need to change \nthat.\n\nI want to share with the Assembly Mongolia\u2019s \nviews and experience. Mongolia is a great nation with a \nrich history. It is an old nation with a young heart. We \nare fortunate to have abundant natural resources, which \noffer great growth prospects and a unique opportunity \nfor economic development and social progress. With \ndouble-digit percentage growth, we are one of the \nworld\u2019s fastest developing economies.\n\nMongolia has achieved many development goals \nin areas such as universal primary education, reducing \n\n\n\f\nchild mortality and improving maternal health. \nHowever, our fifth national MDG progress report \nsuggests that more needs to be done. To reach our \ndevelopment goals, the Government is working closely \nwith all national stakeholders, including political \nparties, the private sector, research institutions, civil \nsociety and the media. Likewise, we invite investors \nto work together for our common interests. Just a \nfew days ago, we hosted the World Economic Forum \nStrategic Dialogue on the Future of Mongolia. That \nevent gathered representatives of multiple stakeholders \nto explore future economic pathways for my country\u2019s \ndevelopment.\n\nMongolians care deeply for the environment. We \ntake seriously our shared responsibility to confront the \nthreat from climate change. That is why we are promoting \na green development policy. We have also created and \npreserved national parks to curb desertification. At the \nsame time, these scenic parks form the backbone of \nnew ecotourism. They will generate both conservation \nincome and green jobs.\n\nMy country is creating an Asian super-network \nfor green development. It will produce renewable \nenergy and provide it to Asian consumers. Mongolia\u2019s \nfirst wind farm, which is privately owned, is now in \noperation. Wind energy has the potential to produce \nelectricity well beyond the country\u2019s needs.\n\nWe face many environmental challenges, including \nland degradation, deforestation, natural disasters and \npollution. Those issues need to be resolved urgently \nand collectively. Environmental education and wider \npublic participation are vital to resolving those \nchallenges. This year we hosted the United Nations \nWorld Environment Day. Indeed, we are at the centre of \nthe green economy. The Mongolian people, particularly \nour young people, are committed to building a better \nenvironmental future.\n\nLast year I spoke of the importance of Mongolia\u2019s \nbattle to root out corruption at all levels. We are combating \ncorruption \u2014 the scourge of democracy \u2014 with a zero-\ntolerance policy at every level of Government. As a \nresult, Mongolia moved up 26 places in Transparency \nInternational\u2019s rankings of States.\n\nTransparency is the key to fighting corruption. \nCitizens have the right to know how their taxes are spent \nat every level of Government, from national agencies to \nthe local administration. Our \u201cglass account\u201d system \nensures that all funds are accounted for openly and \ntransparently. Citizens deserve access to information \nand a say in how their communities are developed. \nThe best Government is the one based on strong civic \nparticipation.\n\nMongolia believes in democratic development. Over \n20 years ago, it was unimaginable that Mongolia would \none day chair the Community of Democracies. That \nwell-known and highly respected global democratic \nmovement is dedicated to promoting freedom and \ndemocracy. Hundreds of human rights activists and \ndemocratic leaders from many countries gathered in \nUlaanbaatar last April. The Ulaanbaatar Declaration \ncharts a future course for promoting democracy. Our \ninitiative, the Asia Democracy Network, and the \nministerial consultative meeting, have laid a solid \nfoundation for democratic development.\n\nI believe that efforts to foster civic engagement \nare more effective with democracy education. The \nimplementation of resolution 67/18, on education for \ndemocracy, will strengthen democratic institutions \nand improve the human rights situation for more of our \nfellow citizens, because knowledge is power.\n\nWe all must focus on promoting human rights. In \nthe past two decades, Mongolia has been learning and \nadvancing democracy at home. With a view to supporting \nemerging democracies, we initiated and established an \ninternational cooperation fund and have already started \nimplementing several projects. We are actively sharing \nthe lessons of parliamentary democracy and conducting \nlegal reform with Kyrgyzstan. We organized training \nfor diplomats and public servants from Afghanistan. \nWe are also discussing the possibility of cooperation \nwith Myanmar and other emerging democracies.\n\nI call on Member States to support our policy of \nprotecting and promoting democratic governance \nand human rights. I humbly ask for States\u2019 support of \nMongolia\u2019s candidature for the Human Rights Council \nin the elections to be held in 2015.\n\nPeace and security remain a fundamental human \nright.\n\nToday people the world over are distressed by \nendless cycles of conflict. Military forces and weapons \nare being used to settle disputes. Thousands of human \nbeings are losing their lives, millions are displaced and \nmany more are suffering. The grave situation in Syria \nis the latest example. We hope that the United States-\nRussian initiative will bear fruit and lead to a peaceful \nresolution of the Syrian conflict.\n\n\n\f\nMongolia firmly supports non-proliferation and the \ncomplete elimination of weapons of mass destruction. \nWe cannot tolerate the use of chemical weapons and \nstrongly condemn any violation of universally accepted \ninternational law. \n\nThis morning I participated in the High-level \nMeeting on Nuclear Disarmament (see A/68/PV.11). \nAs a country with internationally recognized nuclear-\nweapon-free-status, uniquely situated between two \nnuclear-weapon States that are permanent members of \nthe Security Council, Mongolia has been working hard \non nuclear disarmament and the non-proliferation of \nnuclear weapons.\n\nAs a result of our efforts, the five nuclear-weapon \nStates, permanent members of the Security Council, \nhave issued a joint declaration recognizing Mongolia\u2019s \nunique status. They pledged to respect that status and \nnot to contribute to any act that would violate it. Their \njoint commitment ensures that we will not be used as \na pawn in any future nuclear plans or strategies. That \nis Mongolia\u2019s contribution to greater confidence and \nstability in the region.\n\nStrengthening peace and stability in North-East \nAsia is one of Mongolia\u2019s national security priorities. \nWe firmly believe that dialogue and open discussions \nfoster confidence. We have therefore put forth an \ninitiative: the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on North-East \nAsia Security. We invite the other States of the region \nto jointly address various issues of common interest, \nincluding security issues in North-East Asia.\n\nMongolian military officers and troops are \nhonoured to serve along with their fellow United \nNations peacekeepers to maintain international peace \nand security. We are very proud of our peacekeepers \nfor their dedicated service and their invaluable \ncontributions to the cause of peace.\n\nWe all know the complexity of contemporary \nconflicts. Our peacekeepers are serving in areas \nwith high security threats and risks. To support and \nencourage our peacekeepers, last February I took a trip \nto South Sudan and visited the United Nations Mission \nthere. During my visit, I met the President of South \nSudan and offered my support to him and to his nation, \nthe youngest member of the international community.\n\nLet us make our world safer and more prosperous. \nLet us be fearless when it comes to fighting for fairness, \ntransparency and the rule of law. Where there is the rule \nof law, there is less corruption and more human rights. \nWhere there is transparency, there is less economic \ndisparity and greater accountability.\n\nWhere citizens are engaged and informed, good \nthings happen. We must be fearless in our efforts to \npromote and achieve a fair, open and transparent world \ncommunity.\n"

        "file_text": "It is a great honour \nfor me to address the Assembly for the first time as \nVice-President of the Republic of South Sudan.\n\nFirst, I would like to express the heartfelt \ncondolences of the Government and the people of South \nSudan to the people and the Government of the Republic \nof Kenya, in particular the families of those affected \nby the brutal and inhuman act of terror in the Kenyan \ncapital, Nairobi. We condemn all acts of terrorism and \npledge our full cooperation and support to all efforts \n\n\n\f\ngeared towards ridding the region and indeed the globe \nof terrorism.\n\nI convey sincere my gratitude, as well as that \nof President Kiir Mayardit and the people of South \nSudan, to the United Nations, in particular the Security \nCouncil, the countries of the Intergovernmental \nAuthority on Development, the Troika, and all people \nof goodwill for diplomatically helping us to bring to \nan end to the conflict that had devastated our country \nfor decades. We are grateful in particular to the \ninternational community for closely monitoring the \ndifficult implementation of the peace accord. Given the \ncomplexity of the issues involved, the implementation \nof the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) has been \nrelatively successful, although the protocols of the two \nstates of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile, the case of \nthe contested area of Abyei, and the demarcation of the \nborders between South Sudan and the Sudan continue \nto impede the full implementation of the peace accord.\n\nOur country is well endowed with abundant \nnatural resources. Our relations with the Sudan \nhave recently involved unexpected tensions, with \nintermittent suspensions of oil flow through the Sudan. \nInside the South itself, old quarrels dating back to \ntime immemorial have re-emerged among certain \ncommunities over cattle-grazing and water points. \nThis became complicated during the last war as guns \nof various calibre fell into the hands of unauthorized \ncivilians. We are working hard as a Government to \nentrench peace in all corners of South Sudan. We have \nestablished programmes to rehabilitate and integrate \nformer rebel groups into our armed forces and society \nat large.\n\nWe have to build a country literally from scratch, \nwith non-existent physical and social infrastructure. \nThis has given us the worst human development \nindicators in the world, including high maternal and \ninfant mortality rates and high illiteracy rates among a \npopulation of over 8 million.\n\nWhile we recognize that, as humans and as a \nGovernment, we must have made errors of judgment as \nwe sought to fix a war-devastated country, successful \nsteps have also been taken, and we appeal for the \ngoodwill shown to us in those times of difficulty to \ncontinue. We are confronted with the test of adherence \nto human rights as a consequence of malicious action \nby external hands, rather than of our own making. We \ncommend any objective criticism and we call on the \nexperts on South Sudan also to appreciate the bigger \npicture of how well the country is run in our nine other \nstates besides Jonglei.\n\nWe are presently running a Government with \nacceptable standards of competence. A decentralized \nsystem of governance is the outcome of a conscious \ndecision taken by South Sudan\u2019s political leadership, \nas enshrined in the 2011 transitional Constitution, to \nbuild a broad-based democracy in the post-conflict \nsetting. We set up the 10 states with popularly elected \ngovernors and democratic legislatures as a nucleus of \ngood governance. In 2010, President Kiir Mayardit was \ndemocratically and overwhelmingly elected. Our noble \nstruggle was to actualize the ideals and values of true \ndemocracy, so cherished by our people.\n\nAccording to our Constitution, the next elections \nwill be held in 2015. Indeed, on 18 September, our \nPresident publicly confirmed the date. The governing \nparty, the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement (SPLM) \nwill hold another general convention in March 2014 to \nfreely elect its structures in preparation for the 2015 \nnational general elections.\n\nLet me turn to the issue of women. Women have \nsuffered discrimination since 1956, with a literacy rate \nhardly reaching 18 per cent. The SPLM as a ruling party \nis now raising women\u2019s political participation from the \n25 per cent in the current Constitution to a minimum \nof 35 per cent in the proposed permanent constitution.\n\nIn recent years, the National Legislative Assembly, \nof which I was twice elected Speaker and where I served \na total of eight years, enacted a good number of laws, \nincluding the Petroleum Revenue Management Act and \nthe Investment Act, among many others, setting out clear \nrules on how we can efficiently and prudently spend \nour oil revenues. With the support of our development \npartners in the region and internationally, we have now \nembarked on the development of our infrastructure. \nNumerous infrastructural projects are under way. \n\nIn response to the oil shutdown last year, the \nGovernment implemented austerity measures. We \nreduced Government spending by 40 per cent, and at \nthe moment we have considerably increased non-oil \nrevenue collection. We take seriously our responsibility \nto ensure that public funds are properly utilized and \nthat our spending is rigorously monitored. We are thus \ndetermined to uncompromisingly fight practices of \nmaladministration, including corruption.\n\nWe deeply regret the loss of the lives of the Indian \npeacekeepers, the Russian helicopter crew and the \n\n\n\f\nKenyan and South Sudanese relief workers in Pibor \ncounty. We express our condolences to the families and \nthe Governments of those who lost their lives. We wish \nto assure the international community that such tragic \nincidents will not be repeated.\n\nJonglei state, the most populous, with inaccessible \nterrain, has been of particular concern to us as a \nGovernment as well as to the international community. \nThere is no doubt about that. It has serious security and \ninfrastructural impediments. We regret the security \nimpediments in Jonglei and assure the international \ncommunity of our Government\u2019s determination to \ntransform our army, the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation \nArmy (SPLA), into a professional national army \nthat respects human rights and the rule of law and is \ncommitted to the protection of civilians. \n\nThe President has declared a general amnesty for \nthe rebel groups, and already two large groups, one \nunder General Bapin and the second under General \nJohnson Oluny, have responded positively. The \nPresident has also ordered the mandatory disarmament \nof the civilian population and has taken legal steps to \npunish the perpetrators of human rights violations in \nJonglei, including an SPLA Brigade Commander, who \nis now under arrest together with 13 soldiers who have \nbeen sentenced to prison terms that range from three to \nfive years. To date 84 cases of human rights abuses have \nbeen tried in the courts of law. We are determined to \nsee that the violations committed by some indisciplined \nSPLA elements do not go unpunished. \n\nRecently the Government formed a peace and \nreconciliation committee headed by top religious \nleaders to promote dialogue with all groups, including \nrebel groups in Pibor county.\n\nThe Government has allowed the United Nations \nMission in South Sudan (UNMISS), the Office for \nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) \nand other humanitarian bodies unhindered access to \nall parts of the country, including, of course, Jonglei \nstate. Regarding the situation in Pibor county, which \nhas been of particular concern to all of us, we have \ndetermined, thanks to UNMISS and OCHA, the \nnumber of people who are currently registered for food \ndistribution in various camps for internally displaced \npersons and villages. If that number is compared with \nthe pre-conflict population of Pibor county, we could \nnow be relatively relieved at the fact that most of those \nwho had been unaccounted for are in fact alive and \nreceiving much-needed humanitarian assistance from \nUnited Nations agencies and other organizations. \n\nOut of the total population of approximately \n140,000 in Pibor, for instance, nearly 100,000 people \nhave been identified in the Pibor bush alone, along with \nanother 10,000 in Juba City and 26,000 registered as \nrefugees in neighbouring countries. We appeal from \nthis rostrum for expeditious relief assistance in various \nforms.\n\nAnother urgent security demand is the training of \na police force capable of eliminating the high rate of \ncrime we are experiencing in Pibor county and, indeed, \nthe entire country. UNMISS, to which we express our \nprofound appreciation, has helped transform hundreds \nof former combatants into a police force conscious of \nthe rule of law. UNMISS is doing a very commendable \njob under its able leadership. The rate of crime caused \nby the proliferation of small arms has been alarming. \nWhile our police force has managed to apprehend many \ncriminals, others are still at large. The Government \nis committed to erasing this menace. We refute any \nallegation to the effect that such violations are deliberate \nand systematic orchestrations.\n\nOur relationship with the Sudan has been a mixture \nof cooperation and squabbles. Fundamentally, both \nsides acknowledge that there is no alternative to lasting \npeace other than harmony and cooperation, given our \nshared history. That is why President Kiir Mayardit, \nremarkably, visited Khartoum early this month and held \namicable discussions with his counterpart, President \nOmer Hassan Al-Bashir of the Sudan. They agreed to \nenhance cooperation on all fronts, including allowing \nthe unhindered flow of oil from South Sudan through \nthe Sudan.\n\nWe call on the parties at war in the Sudan to find \na durable political solution to the conflict, a situation \nto which the CPA has provided a workable remedy. We \nurge the international community to play a positive, \nstepped-up role in narrowing the gap between both \nparties. The civil war currently taking place in the Nuba \nmountains and Blue Nile regions of the Sudan, as well \nas in Darfur, has created an influx of refugees to South \nSudan, and that is a source of concern for us. We appeal \nfor humanitarian access and supplies for those refugees. \nGiven our unique knowledge, acquaintance and position \nas partners to Khartoum and former comrades-in-arms \nin the fighting forces in those two regions, in addition \nto our interest in realizing peace along our northern \n\n\n\f\nborder, the Government of South Sudan can play a \nconstructive mediation role if required.\n\nOn Abyei, we will continue to cooperate with the \nRepublic of the Sudan to implement the agreement on \nthe final status of Abyei through a referendum, set \nfor October 2013 by the African Union High-Level \nImplementation Panel. The African Union Peace and \nSecurity Council and the United Nations Security \nCouncil accepted the proposal as \u201crepresenting a fair, \nequitable and workable solution\u201d. The international \ncommunity must therefore ensure that this proposal is \nimplemented expeditiously.\n\nOur new Government in Juba, energetic and with \nnew faces, is leaner, so as to reduce expenditure, but \nbroader in terms of inclusiveness of other political parties \nand civil society, even those without party affiliation. \nThe reshuffle has been highly supported and applauded \ncountrywide, with a recent opinion poll carried out by \ntwo organizations \u2014 CRN and ST \u2014 showing 84.7 per \ncent for the new team and 92 per cent for the choice of \nthe new Vice-President. \n\nWhile many, including our friends, had doubted \nour ability to peacefully manage as simple a political \nexercise as a cabinet reshuffle, the domestic backing \nis revealing. Our immediate agenda for the new phase, \nwhich we are calling phase two, is to improve health \ncare, education, roads, electricity supply and the \nquality of life. We are determined to uproot impunity \nand corruption, phenomena which plague post-conflict \nStates, wherever they may be, and which can derail all \nof our efforts and determination to succeed. Based on \nits resolve to combat corruption and set a new standard, \nour Government has erased 16,000 \u201cghost names\u201d \nit found on the police payroll. We are carrying out a \nsimilar exercise in the military and other organized \nforces.\n\nIn conclusion, I wish to repeat that we remain \nsteadfast in our vision of a country at peace with itself \nand with its neighbours \u2014 a country which is growing \nin security, the rule of law and human rights and \nprogressing towards justice and prosperity. I offer my \nsincere thanks to our many partners and friends for their \ncontinued support. We look towards the future confident \nof what we, a people emerging from marginalization \nand suffering civil strife, can accomplish together.\n\nThe Organization has to redouble its efforts to \nnurture and reinforce its new Member, South Sudan, \nboth economically and in its determination to put an \nend to human rights violations. It is important for the \nUnited Nations to monitor and promote the complete \nimplementation of the cooperation agreements reached \nbetween South Sudan and Sudan to cement harmonious \nand peaceful coexistence.\n"

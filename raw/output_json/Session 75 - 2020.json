        "file_text": "Mr President, Excellencies, ladies, and gentlemen,\nLet me start by thanking the UN Secretary-General, for his leadership in these difficult times. I also express gratitude to the dedicated staff of this organization, often working in very challenging circumstances, for their commitment and courage.\nThe international community comes together for the 75th anniversary of the United Nations under exceptional circumstances \u2014 amid a global crisis.\nIceland is fully committed to support the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have contributed to the Global Humanitarian Response Plan, to the UN Response and Recovery Fund and to several other initiatives, including the development, distribution, and fair and equal access to a possible vaccine for every country.\nThis crisis will have long-term implications for our economies and societies, pushing millions of peoples further behind, not least the most vulnerable. We must, therefore, redouble our collective efforts and pursue the Sustainable Development Goals with vigour.\nMr. President,\nThe pandemic has revealed that our fate is interlinked with the successes and failures of others. This very same revelation brought the founders of this great organisation together in 1945, after having lived through the horrors of two world wars. They understood then, as we must now, that we are stronger together than apart.\nThis notion is evident to a small state like Iceland, but larger states also gain from a well-functioning international rules-based order: peace, prosperity and partnerships for our people and planet. For the gravest challenges we face today can only be addressed collectively.\nThe current situation provides us with a perspective. Even if we still have a long way to go, we have witnessed significant achievements over the past 75 years. States have gained their independence, women have gained agency, more parents see their children grow up to become healthy adults, and millions have risen from poverty. Wild polio has recently been eradicated in Africa, a welcome sign of hope in the context of today\u2019s challenges. By most measures, we have been living in times of unprecedented prosperity, something we now know, should not be taken for granted.\nIt is critical that we fight to maintain and improve the multilateral system and oppose/question those who seek to undermine it. We must ensure that our institutions, actions and tools are fit for purpose \u2014 so that the system can continue to serve all of us. The Secretary-General\u2019s ongoing reform agenda has our full support.\nMr. President,\nThe greatest challenge of our time can only be addressed through joint efforts. Climate action needs to be at the heart of our efforts as we build back better and greener after the pandemic. The Paris Agreement is the global baseline, and Iceland is fully committed to its implementation. To build back greener, we need to make full use of science, innovation, and positive financial stimulus for the full participation of the private sector.\nIceland\u2019s new climate action plan, released earlier this summer, goes even further than was agreed in Paris. Our goal is to achieve 35 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and full carbon neutrality by 2040.\nSustainable management of natural resources and the use of renewable energy will be instrumental if we are to combat climate change. That includes the sustainable use of our oceans, a major carbon sink, continuously threatened by climate change, pollution, and mismanagement. Here, international law, namely the Law of the Sea, provides the foundation for action that should be based firmly in science. Iceland will continue to share its expertise in these fields through our development cooperation, public-private partnerships and our capacity-building programs, run under the auspices of UNESCO.\nMr. President,\nAs we embark on a Decade of Action, we need to be firmly focused on advancing gender equality \u2014 not only as a fundamental human right \u2014 but also as critical for accelerated progress so that individuals and nations can prosper and reach their full potential. The slow progress on Sustainable Development Goal 5 on gender equality is therefore deeply worrying, not least as we risk losing a generation or more of gains due to the current crisis.\nWe must act now to ensure the full and equal participation of women in economic and political life, access to education, essential health services, and fight against sexual and gender-based violence. Iceland is therefore committed to contributing in a meaningful way as a co-leader of the Generation Equality Action Coalition on gender-based violence.\nMr. President,\nGrowing nationalism, racism, religious intolerance, and homophobia will continue to undermine human rights and fundamental freedoms if we do not fight to reverse this trend. It is of major concern when the most powerful are ambivalent, even hostile, to the enjoyment of universal human rights by all. UN Members States must speak up and act when human rights are set aside or violated, and not hesitate to use the legal, economic, and political tools we have at our disposal.\nIn the past year, I have had the honour to meet many brave women and men who risk their life and freedom to call out their governments for violation of human rights and fundamental freedom. It is our duty to support and protect these human rights defenders and allow their voices to be heard. We must also protect media freedom, which has come under grave threat in too many countries around the world. Human rights underpin democratic and prosperous societies \u2014 which in turn are the fundamental basis for international stability and peace.\nAs a member of the UN Human Rights Council in 2018 and 2019, Iceland made an effort to demonstrate that all nations, also the smallest among us, can use their voice effectively to speak out for those suppressed or silenced. The experience was both encouraging and empowering, since most UN Member States belong to that group of smaller or mid-size countries.\nThe Human Rights Council is not without faults and shortcomings. We have been critical of the Council\u2019s membership, and the apparent desire by those with less than stellar human rights records to consistently undermine the integrity of the Council. We have also pushed for reform of the council and its working methods.\nMember States serving on the Council should never lose sight of its main mission and purpose \u2014 to protect and promote universal human rights. They should call out violators and hold them accountable and be open to constructive criticism and cooperation, rather than seek refuge behind rhetoric of politicization.\nWith this in mind, and on the basis of the experience of our recent membership of the Human Rights Council, Iceland has decided to run for a seat on the Council for the term 2025-2027.\nMr President,\nLet me thank the Secretary-General for his leadership in calling for a global ceasefire; a call which all nations should support, not least those that hold power to influence the situation on the ground.\nThe ongoing efforts to find political and peaceful solutions to the crisis in Syria, Yemen, and Libya must continue with full backing of those involved. The Middle East Peace Process also needs to be reinvigorated as the current stagnation on both sides only serves to deepen existing disagreements, moving us further away from the two-state solution.\nCloser to my own place of home, in Europe, the persistent unlawful violation by Russia of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and Georgia continues to undermine peace and stability, and recent developments in Belarus give cause for major concern.\nThe Security Council carries special responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and security on behalf of the wider UN membership. The Council, not least some of its permanent members, need to act in accordance with the UN charter, instead of being motivated by narrow political gains in a zero-sum game, undermining the credibility of this vital body.\nMr President,\n\u201cThe UN was not created to take mankind into paradise but rather to save humanity from hell\u201d, former Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold famously once said.\nAs we celebrate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations, we should be mindful that this organization has been a catalyst for human development and progress. And it is the most significant peace project of our times.\nThe UN remains the only international body equipped to bring together different nationalities, political ideologies, and religions, for the common good.\nIt\u2019s shortcomings can neither serve as an excuse for disengagement nor for the promotion of national interests above the pursuit of our common wellbeing and prosperity.\nToo many seek to apply the principles and values of the UN Charter selectively, tilting the balance between rights and responsibilities \u2014 in international trade, rule of law, human rights, disarmament and in preventing conflicts and atrocities.\nOur organisations and institutions should never serve or shelter those who seek to undermine the basic principles of the international rule-based order, which we have all subscribed to, including the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nIt remains, that what we see is our own making. That is why, we need to use the current crisis and the 75th anniversary to reinvigorate our cooperation, build trust and make our institutions more effective and resilient, for today and tomorrow.\nWe should reconfirm our commitment to the principles of the UN Charter, international law, and the liberal international order.\nWe should stand up for these principles when they are being pushed aside. We should make our institutions more open, transparent, and inclusive. We should reform, not rewrite or retreat.\nFor only together we can build the future we want, and the UN we need."

        "file_text": "Esteemed Ladies and Gentlemen,\nToday marks a strange anniversary.\nThis year, for the first time in the history of the UN we have to hold our regular annual session in a virtual setting.\nAll this because of a virus that \u2014 although invisible to the naked eye - has upended our lives completely.\nCOVID-19 has changed the rules regulating our family, social relations and our work in an instant and has created a grave crisis.\nWithin a short period, the health crisis developed into an economic and later a social crisis.\nBusinesses in bankruptcy, jobs lost, drastic restrictive measures and increasing sovereign debt.\nWho would have imagined this, say at the beginning of this year?\nMore and more people say that today\u2019s situation is the prototype for the anthropocene era.\nBecause by the beginning of the 21st century we humans have become the factor that exercises the biggest impact on changes to the planet.\nWe have to brace ourselves \u2014 if we do not radically change our lifestyles \u2014 this crisis will be followed by other ones, which may be even more serious than COVID.\nTherefore today the most important question is, can we learn from the crisis and are we finally ready to do something in the areas, where we have known for a long time that there is a danger looming, where we have known what should be done and that any procrastination would only increase the risks and the costs.\nToday we are as yet unable to defend ourselves against COVID efficiently. There is no drug, no vaccine.\nThere are other areas of life as well, where we have known for years what should be done.\nTake water for example.\nWe have already spoken several times here at the UN about the water crisis unfolding in front of our eyes.\nAbout the drama of too much water and too little water, or contaminated water.\nAnd we all know that the majority of the UN\u2019s sustainability goals are unattainable in the absence of appropriate water policy.\nWhy?\n-\tBecause until every seventh person on Earth is denied access to uncontaminated water, we have no hope for increased productivity in the impoverished regions of the world.\n-\tUntil we are unable to prevent water contamination, we will still have half of all hospital beds occupied with patients suffering from diseases caused by contamination.\n-\tUntil we are able to create the conditions for sustainable water management, we will not have safer food production and we will not be able to feed those already living on the planet, let alone the newly born.\n-\tUntil we are able to transform our energy generation systems, the coal fuelled power plants will not only increase C02 emissions, but will also consume water that would be enough to supply one billion people.\nBut let\u2019s see another example.\nWe have long been saying that the lifestyle we have created is unsustainable. Every year we are consuming more resources than what nature can replenish.\nIt is absurd to believe that we have unlimited supplies of natural resources \u2014 water, soil, diverse biological environment \u2014 available cheaply and until the end of time.\nWhat is the solution? Circular economy.\nWhere waste \u2014 glass, plastic, metals etc. \u2014 are not garbage but recyclable raw materials.\nHow many times have we discussed this? Yet, we have achieved little progress. Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen,\nHungary has never condoned fruitless debates, we have always stood up for action.\nThis is why we have organized the Budapest Water Summit three times already during the recent years.\nThe success of these events has motivated us to strive for more.\nAt the end of next year, we are organizing a sustainability EXPO, which \u2014 beside water management \u2014 will also deal with issues like food production, transportation, energy and waste management as well as education.\nWe look forward to welcoming you all.\nAs for the overcoming of the crisis, let me leave you with the words of Winston Churchill:\n\u201cThe pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity. The optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.\u201d"

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nMr. Secretary-General,\nDistinguished Heads of State and Government,\nI congratulate the President of the 75th session of the General Assembly, Mr. Volkan Bozkir, on his election. We were delighted with the election of a representative of the brotherly Turkey to such a distinguished post. You can be sure that Azerbaijan will spare no effort in extending its support to you in this responsible and honorable endeavor.\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals stipulates that, \u201cthere can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development\u201d. To achieve sustainable international peace and security, there must be put an end to occupation. Adherence to the norms and principles of the international law and implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions must be ensured.\nAlmost 20 per cent of the territory of Azerbaijan remains under occupation of Armenia for almost 30 years. Armenia used military force against Azerbaijan, in brutal violation of the UN Charter and occupied Nagorno-Karabakh and seven other regions of Azerbaijan. More than one million Azerbaijanis became refugees and internally displaced persons.\nArmenia carried out the ethnic cleansing against the Azerbaijani population in the occupied territories. All Azerbaijanis have been forcibly expelled from occupied territories. Armenia committed a number of war crimes and crimes against humanity against Azerbaijani civilians. Armenia established the criminal, terrorist puppet regime in these territories to hide its responsibility for occupation of our lands.\nArmenia committed Khojaly genocide in 1992 killing 613 peaceful residents of Khojaly, among them 106 women and 63 children. More than ten countries have recognized the Khojaly genocide.\nFour UN Security Council resolutions demand immediate, complete, and unconditional withdrawal of the Armenian armed forces from Azerbaijan\u2019s occupied territories.\nIn some case, UN Security Council resolutions have been implemented within days. However, Armenia continues to ignore the UN Security Council\u2019s resolutions for almost 30 years. International sanctions must be imposed on Armenia as an aggressor state.\nIn blatant violation of the international law norms, Armenia implements a policy of illegal settlement on the occupied territories. While the international community, including Azerbaijan is concentrating on eliminating the consequences of Beirut explosion, Armenia misuses the situation by settling Lebanese people of Armenian origin in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan.\nThe illegal settlement is a gross violation of international law, including the Geneva Convention of 1949. This is a war crime. The illegal settlement in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan cannot have any legal effect.\nCultural heritage of Azerbaijani people on the territory of today\u2019s Armenia has been demolished and plundered. Armenia also destroyed all Azerbaijani historical and religious monuments in the occupied territories. The aim is to erase all Azerbaijani traces there.\nArmenia illegally exploits natural resources and uses water reserves to create an artificial environmental crisis in the occupied territories. Armenia extracts gold and other precious metals and minerals of the occupied lands of Azerbaijan and exports to the international markets. It is a scheme of illegal business activities and money laundering.\nInternational companies illegally exploiting Azerbaijan\u2019s natural resources on the occupied territories will face legal responsibility, if they don\u2019t stop their illicit activity immediately. Azerbaijan has already started to take legal action against persons and companies illegally exploiting our natural resources on the occupied lands.\nArmenia deliberately targets civilian population and perpetrates provocations along the Line of Contact and Armenia-Azerbaijan border.\nIn April 2016, Armenia launched a large-scale military attack against Azerbaijan. As a result of this attack, 6 Azerbaijani civilians, including one child were killed, 26 civilians were wounded.\nArmed Forces of Azerbaijan took counter-measures and liberated a part of occupied territories.\nDeliberate attack by Armenia in 2017 led to death of 2 years old Zahra Guliyeva and her grandmother.\nOn 12 July 2020, Armenia perpetrated another provocation along the state border. Our military servicemen and a 76-year-old civilian were killed due to the artillery bombardment of Azerbaijan\u2019s Tovuz district, while extensive damage was done to civilian infrastructure.\nThe purpose of this provocation by Armenia was to create a new source of tension in the region, set aside the issue of Armenia\u2019s occupation of Azerbaijan\u2019s territories, involve third parties in the conflict, and damage Azerbaijan\u2019s strategic infrastructure projects. They also attempted to distract its people\u2019s attention from growing socioeconomic problems in Armenia.\nHowever, Azerbaijan retaliated resolutely, and Armenia failed to achieve any of those objectives. Armenia faced another military defeat. Armenia appealed to ODKB (Collective Security Treaty Organization) for military assistance, thus admitting its defeat.\nRecently, Armenian sabotage group attempted to penetrate through the Line of Contact. The head of this group was detained by Azerbaijani military servicemen on 23 August this year. He confessed that the group was planning to commit terror acts against Azerbaijani military servicemen and civilians.\nThe Armenian Government turned down Azerbaijan\u2019s proposal to exchange all captives based on the principle \u201call to all\u201d. Azerbaijani civilians Dilgam Asgarov and Shahbaz Guliyev, who visited the graves of their parents in the occupied territories, were taken hostage and tortured. They remain in captivity for more than six years.\nThe so-called \u201celections\u201d this March on the occupied territories of Azerbaijan were yet another provocation. These so-called \u201celections\u201d, like previous ones, were strongly condemned and rejected by the international community, including OSCE Minsk Group Co-chairs, Non-Aligned Movement, Organization of Islamic Cooperation, European Union, European Parliament and others.\nIllegal presence of the armed forces of Armenia in the occupied lands of Azerbaijan remains a major threat to regional peace and security. Armenia tries to derail the peace process under the mediation of the OSCE Minsk Group Co-chairs. The aim pursued by Armenia is to maintain the current status-quo of occupation and to annex the occupied territories. Contrary to the constructive engagement of Azerbaijan, the Prime Minister of Armenia deliberately undermines the format and substance of negotiation process. His statement that \u201cKarabakh is Armenia\u201d seriously damages the negotiations process. His unacceptable and groundless socalled seven conditions to Azerbaijan have been rejected by us. We have put forward only one condition to achieve the peace. The armed forces of Armenia must withdraw from all occupied territories of Azerbaijan. The entire world recognizes Nagorno-Karabakh as integral part of Azerbaijan.\nThe Armenian Prime Minister announced the establishment of civilian militia consisting of tens of thousands of civilians who will be forced to undertake military actions against Azerbaijan. The minister of defense of Armenia calls for \u201cnew war for new territories\u201d. Armenia threatens Azerbaijan to strike major cities, critical civilian infrastructures such as Mingachevir water reservoir and Sangachal terminal, which is one of the world\u2019s biggest oil-gas terminals situated near Baku and providing energy security to tens of countries.\nArmenia recruits and uses mercenaries and terrorists from different countries against Azerbaijan. Armenia is a state sponsoring terrorism. Armenia committed more than 30 terror acts in Azerbaijan. We have credible information about the presence of Armenian AS ALA terror organization on the occupied territories.\nArmenian terrorists have killed 24 Turkish diplomats. Varuzhan Karapetian, member of ASALA terror organization who committed a terror act killing many people of different nationalities, in the airport Orly in Paris later was extradited to Armenia and then pardoned by the president of Armenia. This terrorist was treated as a hero in Armenia.\nRecently, Armenia has adopted its aggressive and offensive military doctrine and National Security Strategy. The National Security Strategy contains racist, chauvinistic and \u201cAzerbaijanophobic\u201d ideas.\nThe glorification of Nazism is the state policy of Armenia. Nazi general Garegin Nzhdeh has been turned into \u201cnational hero\u201d. After the Second World War, he was detained and sentenced to 25 years in prison and died there. Almost 6 meter high monument was built in the memory of Nzhdeh in the center of capital of Armenia. Members of a number of Armenian terror organizations like ASALA are glorified in this country.\nHostile, Azerbaijanohobic statements and provocations of Armenian leadership demonstrate that Armenia is preparing for a new aggression against Azerbaijan. We call on the UN and international community to urge Armenia to refrain from another military aggression.\nThe military-political leadership of Armenia will bear all responsibility for instigating provocations and escalation of tensions.\nRegretfully, the OSCE Minsk Group Co-chair\u2019s activity has not yet delivered any results. Negotiations must not be conducted just for the sake of negotiations, they must be target-oriented and meaningful.\nPresidents of the OSCE Minsk Group Co-chair countries \u2014 France, Russia, United States \u2014 in their statements stressed that the status-quo is unacceptable. We welcome these statements, but statements are not enough. We need actions.\nOur involvement in the negotiation process for almost 30 years is a clear demonstration of our commitment to peace. All 11 members of Minsk Group should be actively involved in the process.\nIn accordance with the UN Security Council resolution 853 (1993), updated timetable for withdrawal of armed forces of Armenia from occupied territories of Azerbaijan must be prepared. Appropriate UN institutions must contribute to the implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions and return of Azerbaijani internally displaced persons to their native lands. The UN Security Council resolutions are not timespecific. These resolutions are valid until they are implemented. Misinterpretation of UN Security Council resolutions is unacceptable.\nThe Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict must be resolved on the basis of the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan\u2019s territorial integrity has never been and will never be a subject of negotiations. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan must be completely restored. Nagorno-Karabakh is ancient and historical Azerbaijani lands. Karabakh is Azerbaijan.\nWe are seriously concerned by increasing cases of arms supply to Armenia, especially right after the military provocation of Armenia in Tovuz district of Azerbaijan. Active military clashes at the state border stopped on 16 July. Next day starting from 17 July until September, we witnessed delivery of more than one thousand tons of military equipment to Armenia by military cargo planes. Taking into account that Armenia is one of the poorest countries of the world and can not afford paying for weapons billions of US dollars, we assume that it gets weapons free of charge.\nSupply of weapons to an aggressor and a country that perpetrated ethnic cleansing significantly undermines the peace negotiations and encourage the occupying state to instigate new military provocations. In this context, we urge all countries to refrain from supplying arms to Armenia.\nBecause of aggression against Azerbaijan, Armenia continues to face deep demographic, social and economic crisis. Regime change happened in Armenia two years ago, but fascist ideology of this failed state remains unchanged.\nHuman rights are massively violated in Armenia. Judges are pressured and blackmailed, journalists, opposition activists and political opponents jailed by despotic regime. In fact, a dictatorship has been established in Armenia.\nCriminal cases have been opened against two former presidents of this country. Members of parliament despite their immunity are detained.\nMher Yegiazarian, an Armenian journalist and politician died in prison following hunger strike in January 2019. But there was no reaction from international organizations whose duty is to observe democracy and human rights worldwide. Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Freedom House and others turned blind eye on unhuman and brutal actions of despotic regime of Armenia. The reason can be that Pashinyan regime is financed and supported by Soros who sponsors many so-called human rights non-governmental organizations worldwide.\nPolitical relations in this country have reached the point of crisis. The country has been ruled by warlords over 20 years. Incumbent political leadership continues the practice of previous regimes. There is no prospect for development of Armenia unless the consequences of military aggression against Azerbaijan are eliminated.\nArmenia was the only country to oppose the initiative of holding the Special Session of UN General Assembly in response to COVID-19, whereas in Armenia, the situation with coronavirus is the most desperate. Armenia objected to this initiative only because Azerbaijan has launched it. The objection to such an endeavor is a product of irrational thought. It is another demonstration of the policy of \u201cAzerbaijanophobia\u201d that has prevailed in Armenia and promoted by the government. Hatred against Azerbaijani people is instilled in the young generation.\nDespite the enormous difficulties caused by Armenian occupation, Azerbaijan managed to build a stable, modern, democratic and multicultural country. Development of democracy and human rights protection are among top priorities of our government. All fundamental freedoms are fully provided, including freedom of expression, media freedom, freedom of assembly, religious freedoms, as well as development of civil society. We launched broad political dialogue initiative several months ago. All major political parties supported this initiative. The political dialogue which successfully started would help to strengthen our political system and serve the cause of sustainable development of Azerbaijan.\nAzerbaijan\u2019s economy has developed rapidly, and GDP tripled in the last 17 years. Poverty in Azerbaijan went down from 49 per cent to 5 per cent within 17 years. Over 3700 schools have been built or completely renovated in Azerbaijan in the last 17 years. The literacy rate is close to 100 per cent in our country. As a country with significant progress in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals, Azerbaijan has been one of the few states to submit voluntarily national reviews to the UN twice. Azerbaijan ranks 54th among 166 countries in the Sustainable Development Goals Index, according to the \u201cSustainable Development Report 2020\u201d.\nAzerbaijan has participated actively in regional connectivity projects, such as East-West, North-South, North-West transportation corridors, becoming one of Eurasia\u2019s primary and reliable transport and logistics hubs. We have also commissioned the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railroad and the Baku International Trade Seaport with the potential of handling capacity of 25 million tons. According to the Davos Economic Forum\u2019s Global Competitiveness Report 2019, among 141 countries, Azerbaijan ranks 11th for \u201cEfficiency of railroad services\u201d, 12th for \u201cEfficiency of air transportation services\u201d, 25th for \u201cEfficiency of seaport services\u201d and 27th for \u201cQuality of road infrastructure\u201d.\nAzerbaijan is a member of the international space club. Today we have 3 satellites \u2014 2 for telecommunication and one earth observation satellite. 80 per cent of our population uses the internet.\nWe have launched efficient measures to tackle the problem of freshwater shortage due to the climate change. Azerbaijan has ratified the Paris Agreement, with a voluntary obligation to achieve a 35 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to the base year 1990. In Azerbaijan, we use environmentally friendly natural gas and hydroelectric power stations for electricity generation.\nMulticulturalism is the way of life for the people of Azerbaijan. We present to the world the example of tolerance and coexistence. The \u201cBaku Process\u201d launched by Azerbaijan in 2008 to strengthen dialogue and cooperation between the Muslim world and Europe, is supported by the United Nations. The UN General Assembly\u2019s resolutions have recognized the World Forum on Intercultural Dialogue held in Azerbaijan every two years as a \u201ckey global platform for promoting intercultural dialogue\u201d.\nThe 7th Global Forum of the UN Alliance of Civilizations was held in Azerbaijan in 2016. Furthermore, Azerbaijan hosted the first ever European Games and 4th Islamic Solidarity Games in 2015 and 2017 respectively. These sporting events are our great contribution to the promotion of multiculturalism as well.\nPope Francis paid a visit to Azerbaijan in 2016. This February, I visited the Vatican and had a meeting with Pope Francis. During our meeting, Pope Francis referred to Azerbaijan as a \u201ctrue example of tolerance\u201d.\nAzerbaijan attaches great significance to the restoration of religious monuments, mosques, churches, and synagogues. We have implemented joint projects to restore such religious and historical monuments in different countries.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has changed the situation in the world entirely, and as a result, new realities have emerged. Initially, the virus was expected to affect developing nations. However, the pandemic has had a significant impact on the developed nations as well. It shows once again that the virus recognizes no borders. It is only through mutual support and joint efforts we can overcome the pandemic.\nAzerbaijan has taken timely and necessary preventive measures to stop the spread of the virus. Azerbaijan\u2019s attainment of the Millennium Development Goals and progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals has enabled us to conduct an effective fight against the pandemic. The healthcare infrastructure in Azerbaijan has been developed and renovated significantly, with almost 700 hospitals and healthcare facilities built or completely renovated in the past 17 years.\nThanks to measures undertaken, the country\u2019s situation with COVID-19 has remained under control. Our citizens\u2019 life and health is priority for us, despite the economic difficulties caused by pandemic.\nThe socio-economic stimulus package worth over $2 billion has been released to ensure economic stability, tackle employment issues, and ensure macroeconomic and fiscal stability. The social relief measures cover nearly 5 million people, which is a half of our population.\nThe World Health Organization named Azerbaijan an example in the fight against the pandemic.\nWe have made voluntary contributions to the World Health Organization in the amount of $10 million in 2 equal tranches. The second tranche was allocated for the Non-Aligned Movement\u2019s member states. Azerbaijan has provided humanitarian and financial assistance to more than 30 countries with respect to coronavirus.\nWith a unanimous decision of all 120 countries of Non-Aligned Movement Azerbaijan was elected as a chair of this body. In October 2019 Azerbaijan assumed the chairmanship of Non-Aligned Movement during the 18th Summit of the Heads of State and Government held in Baku. In my statement at the summit I stressed that Azerbaijan will do its utmost to advocate for interests of Non-Aligned Movement\u2019s countries. Azerbaijan will defend justice and norms of international law.\nThe Non-Aligned Movement\u2019s Extraordinary Summit in response to coronavirus via videoconference, was held on our initiative in May 2020. During that Summit, I suggested holding of the Special Session of the UN General Assembly in response to coronavirus at the level of the heads of state and government. This initiative was supported by more than 130 UN member states.\nI think the Special Session will serve as a framework for addressing the pandemic\u2019s impact on all spheres and contribute to the efforts of eliminating its consequences.\nInternational peace and security problems, the pandemic\u2019s impact on the countries of the world call for solidarity between the countries. I want to put forward several proposals to this end:\nThe reforms within international organizations are particularly timely and essential in the post-pandemic period. In this regard, particular attention should be paid to increasing the UN\u2019s role and prestige on the global level and its ability to undertake more adequate response measures concerning the challenges of modern times.\nThe non-fulfillment of the Security Council resolutions undermines the prestige of the United Nations. Implementation mechanisms must be created for the UN Security Council resolutions.\nRefugees and IDPs have become the most vulnerable group of the pandemic period. The return of these vulnerable groups to their native lands in safety and dignity gains great urgency.\nEnsuring affordability and fair distribution of a vaccine is necessary, while the least developed countries should get it free of charge. In this regard, additional oversight mechanisms should be developed.\nThe scope of the pandemic\u2019s negative impact on implementing the Sustainable Development Goals by the countries must be carefully analyzed, and solutions must be formulated.\nThank you for your attention."

        "file_text": "Secretary-General Guterres, fellow delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nI am sorry that circumstance dictates that we cannot be together for this, the 75th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations.\nSince we met last, our world has changed beyond all recognition.\nCOVID-19 has raised questions about globalisation that up until now were confined to risk-management workshops. Questions we never imagined we would face, let alone need to answer. How we live. How we work. How we interact with one another.\nThe cost has been without modern precedent. Lives lost to the disease. Lives shattered by the economic consequences. Lives upended by the impact of societal change.\nThe pandemic has even given birth to a new norm, where we no longer hug, shake hands or high-five. Where an elbow bump defines the limits of our physical connection. Where our faces may be hidden, but our humanity remains intact.\nI refuse to believe, however, that all these new norms will define a new world.\nRather I look on with respect and awe at how our doctors and nurses, our scientists, and our experts have responded. Because I believe that their actions demonstrate that there is no problem, no matter how complicated, that we cannot solve.\nWe may be separated by a new invisible threat to our health, our prosperity and our freedom, but as this virtual broadcast demonstrates, we are still very much connected. And we are, I believe, increasingly united. Connected by the power of innovation. United by a newfound determination to work together for the improvement of our global family of nations.\nIf, as now seems possible, we can develop complex vaccines in a matter of a year, or perhaps eighteen months, why I would ask can we not work together to solve some of the other great global challenges of our age?\nAristotle wrote that \u201cNature has never done anything uselessly.\u201d In other words, nature forces us to innovate. Choice doesn\u2019t come into it.\nAristotle lived internationaln an era where human activity did not have the capacity to massively impact our natural environment. But his words remain prescient.\nBecause if COVID-19 has taught us anything at all, it is that we cannot afford to wait for the next crisis before we take pre-emptive action.\nOn climate change. On biodiversity. On global health. On tackling the root causes of migration. On development. Ultimately, the sustainability of humankind.\nThat is why the values and principles at the heart of the United Nations matter as much today as they did when Greece signed the UN Charter in 1945. Those values \u2014 of peace and security, equality, human rights and self-determination \u2014 and those principles \u2014 of justice and the rule of law \u2014 are at the core of what it means to be Greek.\nAfter all, this year not only marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the UN but the 2500th anniversary of Greece\u2019s victory at the battle of Salamis. A victory that helped to pave the way for the foundation of classical Greece and the birth of democracy and the rule of law. And today it is that democracy and that rule of law that underpin the values and principles at the heart of the United Nations.\nThe challenges we face in 2020 may be different from those of the post-war years, but in many respects they are just as significant, just as momentous.\nWe face an unprecedented and truly global public health crisis \u2014 the first of modern times. The world\u2019s major economies are in contraction. Our vital biodiversity system appears on the brink of collapse, with a million species on the edge of extinction.\nTransnational issues threaten our individual, regional, and collective security. And malign actors pose an insidious and growing threat to our way of life, to multilateralism and to the proper functioning of international law.\nAnd yet, in the twelve months since we last met the way Greece and the Greek people have responded to theses challenge has proved to me that there is a way through this uncertainty.\nLet me be absolutely clear with you. Years of austerity had left Greece vulnerable to a pandemic. Coronavirus threatened to overwhelm our health service. And yet we proved that agility, flexibility and new technology can empower people and achieve results that once seemed impossible.\nWe prioritized competence, utilizing facts and data rather than relying on ideology. Harnessing the best in innovation and technology; and putting trusted experts at the center of our decision-making and communication. It worked. Against all odds, Greece was extremely successful in dealing with the first wave of the pandemic.\nHowever, now the second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic is ante portas. We need to learn to live with the virus until we have the scientific tools to eradicate it. It will take perseverance, agile policies that protect the most vulnerable, continued trust in the experts and individual responsibility to succeed. But I am convinced that we can do it.\nThe other great geopolitical challenge we face concerns Turkey.\nAt the General Assembly last year, I had made a point of extending the hand of friendship and co-operation to President Erdogan. I even talked of my willingness to act as a bridge-builder for Turkey in Europe.\nSadly, where Greece put trust, dialogue and understanding at the heart of a values-based foreign policy, Turkey responded with escalation, provocation, disinformation, and aggression. Where Greece chose the path of dialogue in good faith, Turkey chose the path of intransigence.\nBe in no doubt, Turkey\u2019s actions undermine international law and threaten the security and stability of the broader region of the Eastern Mediterranean and of all EU member states. The European Union made it absolutely clear that unilateral actions will not be left unanswered when they threaten sovereign rights of member states.\nHowever, in spite of the recent events, I remain an optimist. Everybody understands that this constant escalation of tension cannot continue. And I refuse to believe that partnership between near neighbors is not possible. Look at the recent agreement struck between Israel and the UAE. Both friends of Greece, now friends with each other. Years of suspicion and animosity have been replaced by co-operation and mutual understanding.\nSo, let\u2019s meet, let\u2019s talk, and let\u2019s seek a mutually acceptable solution. Let\u2019s give diplomacy a chance. If, after all, we still cannot agree, then we should trust the wisdom of the international court at The Hague.\nThe beginning of exploratory talks between our two sides, which was announced two days ago, is a step in the right direction. If President Erdogan really believes the United Nations stands as a beacon of hope and a bastion of global cooperation, then I would urge him to act in accordance with its values.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nWhat then of the challenges I highlighted at the start of these remarks? Challenges like climate change, biodiversity, sustainable development, and migration. Challenges that need action today, not discussion tomorrow.\nAction that is shifting Greece towards the use of renewable energy as we speak. We are phasing out our use of lignite \u2014 or brown coal \u2014 in our power stations. By 2028 it will be a thing of the past. By the time we meet again next year in New York, many of Greece\u2019s single use plastics will have been banned.\nThe terrible fire at the Moria camp, on Lesbos, earlier this month, has highlighted the huge challenge posed by mass migration, in particular on Europe\u2019s southern borders. Greece cannot manage this issue alone. We\u2019ve received invaluable support from the UNHCR and the IOM, but we need to be honest. Whilst our migrant numbers are down, our coastguard is still saving thousands of desperate men, women and children in the waters of the Mediterranean every year.\nThis is a collective failure of the international community and we must all share the blame for that failure. That is why we must do more together to tackle the root causes of migration: poverty, deprivation, economic uncertainty, exploitation, violence and war. Unless we tackle these inequalities, the problem will never be fully resolved.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nWhat this last year has proved to me is that competence and values are essential partners.\nSuccess is measured not through the delivery of one at the expense of the other, but through the deployment of both: competence and all that comes with the reliable delivery of results; and values, the framework for how we interact with tolerance and compassion.\nAs a result, we have seen the emergence of a new national self-confidence, and a renewed sense of pride in Greece. We are no longer viewed through the prism of bailouts and austerity. Greeks have rejected the empty promises, the exploitation and the divisiveness of populism.\nIn another 75 years, when our children\u2019s children speak here at the United Nations, I for one believe that they will be describing a better world. A world where quantum technology has revolutionised healthcare and our own biology. A world where fossil fuels are just that, a thing of the past. A world where equality, opportunity and morality guide our leaders.\nWe have the raw ingredients in front of us today. We harness more collective intelligence and knowledge than we ever have in human history. But we must promote the values and the competence to guide that resource, to deploy it for the betterment of our world. After all, we only have one!\nI, for one, believe we can do just that.\nThank you for listening."

        "file_text": "DISTINGUISHED PRESIDENT VOLKAN BOZKIR!\nDISTINGUISHED SECRETARY-GENERAL ANTONIO GUTERRES! DISTINGUISHED HEADS OF DELEGATIONS!\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN!\nThe seventy-fifth session of the General Assembly is being held for the first time in the history of the United Nations in a completely new format \u2014 an online videoconferencing due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nSuch a global catastrophe has not been observed on our planet in the last hundred years.\nThis calamity has vividly revealed humanity\u2019s vulnerability.\nThe current threatening and complex situation has proved that all states and peoples of the world are interconnected and that regular dialogue, trust and close cooperation among us are extremely important.\nIn this context, all of us have deeply realized the need to consolidating the mutual efforts of governments, parliaments, civil society institutions; strengthening the principles of common responsibility; coordinating international partnership accordingly; increasing the status and capacity, as well as expanding the competences of the World Health Organization.\nOur goal is to jointly create fair global system that ensures basic rights, freedoms, health and well-being of every human being.\nIn this regard, we propose to develop under the UN auspices an International Code of Voluntary Commitments of States during pandemics.\nThis document should reflect each state\u2019s commitments to its citizens and international partners.\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN!\nSince the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak in Uzbekistan, we have focused all our efforts and resources to containing this dangerous disease and, most importantly, saving the people\u2019s lives.\nSocial protection and health systems are being cardinally strengthened to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic; targeted support is provided to the population, sectors of the economy and businesses.\nSpecial funds have been set up to this end.\nI would like to take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to all our friends and partners who have generously supported during this time of trials.\nWe fully support the international community\u2019s all efforts to effectively combat the pandemic, including the development and widespread use of essential drugs and vaccines.\nWe also welcome the proposal of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to hold a summit on the pressing issues of food security in the current context of the crisis.\nDEAR PARTICIPANTS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY!\nThree years ago, speaking from the high rostrum of the United Nations, I stated that Uzbekistan was firmly determined to implement radical reforms.\nAs a result of our large-scale measures on political, social and economic modernization of society, a new Uzbekistan is being formed.\nToday, the process of democratic transformations in our country has become irreversible.\nLast year\u2019s parliamentary elections demonstrated the growing political activism of the population and parties, the role of civil society institutions and the influence of the media.\nThe gender equality policy became a priority for us.\nThe role of women in public administration is growing. In our new Parliament the number of women deputies has doubled.\nThe human rights situation has also completely changed. The forced and child labour were fully abolished. The National Human Rights Strategy was adopted.\nIn response to a call from the United Nations to reduce the number of stateless persons, this year alone 50,000 of our compatriots were granted Uzbek citizenship.\nThe situation with religious freedom in our country has also improved dramatically.\nFurther strengthening the inter-ethnic harmony and inter-religious tolerance is a constant important task for us.\nComprehensive reforms to ensure true independence of the judiciary and the rule of law are being consistently implemented.\nThe uncompromising fight against corruption has reached a new level.\nIn this regard, important legislation has been adopted and independent Anti-Corruption Agency was established.\nThe economic reforms are being dynamically continued in our country.\nFor the first time, we have publicly declared our determination to reduce poverty.\nWe are achieving this through development of entrepreneurship and job creation; improving the investment climate and business environment; building a modern infrastructure and providing targeted social assistance to the population through training people to new professions.\nIn our country, where over half of the population is young, an extensive work is underway to ensure that every young person takes a worthy place in society and demonstrate their potential.\nThe Youth Parliaments and the Agency for Youth Affairs are operating in Uzbekistan.\nIn August the Samarkand International Forum on Youth Rights was successfully held under the auspices of the United Nations.\nI would like to take this opportunity to once again call on you to support Uzbekistan\u2019s initiative to adopt the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Youth.\nIn addition, we propose to adopt a special resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on enhancing the role of parliaments in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and ensuring human rights.\nDEAR FRIENDS!\nThe fundamental changes are taking place now in the region of Central Asia.\nWe have managed to create an atmosphere of good neighbourliness, mutual trust, friendship and mutual respect among the states of the region.\nOur common achievement is consultative summits of the Central Asian Heads of State, which was put forth as an initiative at the 72nd session of the United Nations General Assembly and has been regularly held since then.\nOver the past four years, Uzbekistan\u2019s bilateral trade with neighbouring states has grown almost five-fold.\nDuring these days of trial our countries are standing by and not leaving one another alone.\nToday, the Central Asian states face an important strategic task.\nThis is to ensure deep integration of our region into the global economic, transport and transit corridors.\nIn this regard, we propose to establish a Regional Centre for the Development of Transport and Communications under the auspices of the United Nations.\nToday, the effective security cooperation is maintained in Central Asia.\nThe United Nations Global Anti-Terrorism Strategy is being successfully implemented.\nWe are in favour of conducting the International conference on the ten-year results and forthcoming prospects of this Joint Plan of the Regional Strategy.\nAs it is well-known, the ancient cultural and rich spiritual heritage of our region is of global importance.\nWe are ready to hold the International Forum \u201cCentral Asia at the Crossroads of World Civilizations\u201d in the ancient city of Khiva in 2021 in cooperation with UNESCO.\nDEAR PARTICIPANTS OF THE SESSION!\nWe see Afghanistan as an integral part of Central Asia.\nThe Tashkent High-Level Conference on Afghanistan in March 2018 marked a new stage in the mobilization of the international community\u2019s efforts to resolve the Afghan problem.\nWe fully support the peace talks among the Afghan political forces launched this year in the city of Doha in September.\nWe express hope that these talks will serve for bringing in peace and stability in the long-suffering land of Afghanistan.\nIn order to broadly involve Afghanistan in the process of economic integration in the region, we have started the implementation of major infrastructure projects such as the Surkhan-Puli Khumri power line and construction of a railway from Mazar-i-Sharif to the sea ports of the Indian Ocean.\nWe believe that the issues of ensuring peace and stability in Afghanistan must remain a constant focus of the United Nations.\nOnly together and through close cooperation we can realize all the dreams and aspirations of the Afghan people.\nIn this regard, it is important to work on the principle of \u201cFrom instability and destruction \u2014 to peace and prosperity\u201d.\nTo this end, we propose to establish a permanent UN commission on Afghanistan that would address the concerns of long-suffering Afghan people.\nThe main task of this Commission must be to promote and facilitate the economic and social development of Afghanistan.\nDISTINGUISHED HEADS OF STATE AND GOVERNMENT! Another acute problem of our time is related to global climate change. Today, every country feels the negative effects of this process.\nUnfortunately, such negative developments also pose a great threat to the sustainable development of Central Asia.\nI would like to once again draw your attention to the devastating effects of the drying up of the Aral Sea.\nThe Aral Sea region became the centre of an environmental tragedy.\nTo mitigate the current situation, we are carrying out an enormous work to create two million hectares of new plantations and forests, to form a layer of soil.\nOn our country\u2019s initiative, the United Nations Multi-Partner Human Security Trust Fund for the Aral Sea Region was established.\nWe hope that this Fund will serve as a base platform for the international community to provide practical assistance to the population living in a stressed ecological zone.\nWe propose to adopt a special resolution of the UN General Assembly declaring the Aral Sea region an area of ecological innovation and technologies.\nIt would be expedient to mark the date of adoption of this important document as the International Day for the Protection and Restoration of Ecosystems.\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN!\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize yet another point: the continuing unrest in various parts of the world, the growing conflict and violence, environmental disasters and other modern threats are exacerbating the global problems of misery and poverty.\nThese problems become especially acute in the condition of pandemic.\nThe voice of poverty, which is getting even more alarming today, must raise concerns in entire world community and all of us.\nIn this regard, we propose to set the issues of poverty eradication and the fight against poverty as one of the main topics of the next session of the United Nations General Assembly and hold a Global Summit on these issues.\nDEAR FRIENDS!\nIt is clear to all of us that the socio-economic landscape of the post-pandemic world will be completely different.\nWe need to work on the basis of new approaches and close cooperation against common threats to security and sustainable development.\nThe central role of the United Nations as a coordinating international structure needs to be further strengthened.\nUzbekistan always stands ready to develop a wide-ranging and mutually beneficial partnership with all countries of the world, as well as practical dialogue with the United Nations and its institutions.\nThank you for your attention."

        "file_text": "H.E. Mr. Volkan Bozkir, President of the General Assembly,\nH.E. Mr. Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General,\nHeads of State, Heads of Government,\nAuthorities participating in this 75th Session of the UN General Assembly,\nAt the outset, I want to apologize for removing my face mask, which is necessary in this time of pandemic, and I want to greet all who watch and listen to us around the world.\nAllow me to congratulate you, Mr. President, on behalf of the Constitutional Government of Venezuela and the People of our Bolivarian Republic for assuming the Presidency of this 75th Session of the General Assembly. A great occasion of great importance due to the stellar situation that humanity is going through caused by this world emergency generated by the COVID-19. I say a stellar situation because, in addition to posing serious difficulties for the complex planetary order, it is also an opportunity to reflect on and promote the change of paradigms that humanity itself, especially the great majorities who are vulnerable to poverty and exclusion, expect so much from us, so much from world leaders.\nIn this same General Assembly, in 2001, our Eternal Commander Hugo Chavez\nsaid,\n\u201cWe come, then, without fear, in good faith and with much optimism about life, brotherhood, unity and the possibility that we, as the leaders of our countries, can seek, grasp and build together real solutions to real problems in the quest for justice and peace.\u201d\nFrom Venezuela, we believe that the world must be completely revised, with a great magnifying glass said Commander Chavez; a very powerful magnifying glass, because the world has become very bad, it has been stumbling from one mistake to another. It was a call made by Commander Chavez in 2001, to take a sense of reality in the re-founding of the United Nations Organization. And we have arrived at 2020, insisting on this need for renewal of the paradigms.\nVenezuela recognizes that, in these 75 years, the United Nations Organization has given great contributions to humanity. However, we demand more will and efforts to preserve the achievements, to advance in new objectives. We insist on the need to strengthen South-South cooperation and to create alternative mechanisms for financing and technical support that will back up the initiatives and priorities defined by our peoples to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. This is a timely and urgent task and every day counts. \u201cThe South also thinks, the South also matters, the South also exists\u201d, as the poet Benedetti said, from his centennial presence.\nWe must all work to save our planet. We make a call to achieve the highest political commitment to fight climate change which is a reality and an urgent priority. We recognize the importance of strengthening mitigation and adaptation actions, in accordance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. We therefore reaffirm the importance of the means of implementation for developing countries to carry out their climate actions. Noam Chomsky recently warned, \u201cthere is not much time left\u201d.\nMr. President,\nThe United Nations and humanity as a whole face a deep and complex crisis, combining the COVID-19 pandemic with the global climate change challenges and sustainable development.\nAdded to this disturbing scenario is the no less alarming claim of the great powers to lead humanity into direct confrontation in the military sphere. This would be, perhaps, the last one for our species. The United States of America, far from taking a positive or proactive leadership position, conducts itself erratically under a government that is intransigent and hostile to diplomacy and high politics, since it openly disregards multilateralism and any type of pre-existing global rule.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has come to change the realities and priorities of all humanity, because of its consequences for human life. The pandemic has made evident the inequalities in the world and exacerbated them. Unfortunately, some contingency measures in the face of the pandemic have increased the social and economic gaps within countries. That is why the international community, as a whole, must provide a global and coordinated response to support all nations in need, helping to create the conditions for stronger economies and more inclusive societies.\nEven before the COVID-19 pandemic, the collapse of the international geopolitical and geo-economic order was already taking place. However, this emergency has made us aware of and critically think about the contradictions of capitalism and its logical and operational inability to deal with these crises. In many cases, the States were reduced to a minimum expression and the imposed neo-liberalism suffocated the public institutions, turning the rights of the people into private services; health became a luxury. Let us hear in the streets of the world the fury of the peoples who feel orphaned and unprotected! The health and well-being of the population are not merchandise; the market cannot continue to regulate the destiny of humanity!\nVenezuela believes that the role of the World Health Organization (WHO) should be an example of multilateralism that we need to strengthen. The WHO must be an organization that acts and speaks faithfully, without bowing to pressure, extortion and attacks from the powerful; that confirms its moral authority, its scientific capacity and cooperation based on solidarity.\nWe welcome the enormous scientific efforts of sisterly nations such as Russia, China and Cuba in creating an effective and safe vaccine against COVID-19, and we trust that such findings will be considered a global public good by each of our nations, with free access for all the peoples of the world, without discrimination.\nFrom the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, we propose the creation of a revolving public purchasing fund within the United Nations System to guarantee access to food and health products, financed with public resources. This will make it possible to face discrimination and the economic blockade against countries by making it easier for governments to acquire necessary goods and services.\nWe call for the strengthening of financing policies and funds aimed at the development of local production chains and new economic actors, as well as the creation of a bank of free technologies and universal education and training processes.\nThe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela advocates the adoption of a legally binding international instrument on development and the right to development, which will strengthen the struggle of peoples to overcome poverty and social inequalities and for social justice.\nOur re-election as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council, by the sovereign and majority votes of the countries represented in the United Nations System \u2014 despite the incessant attacks by the U.S. empire and its satellites \u2014 has reaffirmed our commitment to promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people, without distinction of any kind and in a fair and equitable manner, strongly supporting any initiative in the fight against ethnic, gender, nationality and other related forms of intolerance. We are committed to upholding the principles of universality, impartiality, objectivity, non-politicization, and nonselectivity in their implementation. We are committed to international, intercultural, constructive, and cooperative dialogue to advance the promotion and protection of all human rights, including, of course, the right to comprehensive development of peoples.\nMr. President,\nThe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela ratifies its commitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with the principles set forth in the United Nations Charter and, in that sense, in relation to the territorial dispute over Guayana Esequiba, Venezuela reiterates its strict adherence to the Geneva Agreement of 1966. In particular, we emphasize the object, purpose, and reason for the Geneva Agreement, which clearly mandates reaching a practical, satisfactory, and mutually acceptable solution through successive mechanisms provided for in Article 33 of the United Nations Charter. It is through political, diplomatic and mutually agreed upon negotiation that we will reach the solution of this dispute inherited from imperial colonialism.\nMr. President,\nThe world has continued to face many injustices that affect innocent peoples, threatening their extermination; actions of States that are unjustified and inadmissible and that embarrass humanity.\nLet us once again reiterate our support and solidarity with the Arab people of Palestine and demand respect for their historic territories established in 1967 by this United Nations Organization.\nWe support the call of the United Nations to put an end to the infamous, criminal, almost 60-year-old blockade against our sisterly nation of Cuba and, in this regard, we reaffirm the call to the U.S. government to immediately put an end to the economic, commercial and financial blockade it imposes on our sisterly nation.\nMr. President,\nThe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reiterates its commitment to the need to promote and strengthen dialogue and cooperation by building bridges among peoples, respecting cultural and religious differences, through conflict prevention, reconciliation and peacebuilding. The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) has promoted the recognition of these initiatives, policies and values, with the celebration of the International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for Peace, and has joined the Group of Friends of the UN Alliance of Civilizations, who are waving the flags of pluralism and equity. There is still much to be done, and we will do it.\nMr. President,\nVenezuela, as you know, is under constant attack. Our beloved Homeland is the victim of a multiform attack by the U.S. Empire, in the media field, in the political field, in the economic field; we have even been threatened with direct military aggressions.\nThe unilateral measures imposed by the Government of the United States of America have tried to subdue the Venezuelan people. However, our people, together with the Constitutional Government, have heroically resisted the opprobrium, the illegality, the inhumanity of an empire which today represents the most serious threat facing the multi-polar and multi-centered world.\nToday, standing up, and with the dignity of the people, children of the glories of the Liberator Simon Bolivar, we say to the supremacist Government of the United States that the world is watching them, that the 21st century has millions of eyes that see beyond the media matrices. There is still time to return to international legality. We tell you that you are still in time to reverse the discredit and global malaise that your arbitrariness and arrogance provoke in the conscious world. Continuing on the path of violation of the United Nations Charter will lead them inexorably to the isolation, discredit and condemnation of the history of peoples, including that of their own people, the people of the United States, who have taken to the streets to protest against racism, against police brutality, against abuse.\nUnilateral coercive measures have awakened not only the indignation and repudiation of the peoples against the alleged global dictatorship raised from the United States, which is trying to impose on us, but have also generated cohesion and national initiatives around new forms of production, technical and technological solutions. Inventiveness has been the answer to the persecution of our national industry. This is what the real Venezuelan is like, of flesh and bone, who is so hidden and who they try so hard to despise. Today I can tell you, Excellency that a revolution of innovation has been unleashed in our Homeland, a new offensive to transform into a virtuous cycle of opportunities the attempts of aggression to make our nation collapse.\nWe have made a titanic effort with our own capacities, in addition to the solidarity and cooperation of friendly countries and the United Nations System to confront the entire COVID-19 pandemic situation. We have avoided the worst, despite the plans, prognoses and catastrophic wishes of those who attack us. Neither the illegal blockade, nor the aggressions against our government have distracted us and prevented us from fulfilling a great effort: the goal of protecting the lives of our population.\nToday we can say that we have applied about 1.9 million free tests, which has represented, today, the average of 62,489 tests per million inhabitants. We can say that we are the Latin American and Caribbean country that has carried out the most tests on its people; we say this with humility and with the desire to always help the neighboring countries from whom, with frequency, we only receive aggressions from their governments. This, which is a Venezuelan truth, you will not hear it, you will not see it on the front pages of the traditional media, much less in the social networks or on the Internet; the blockade is also communicational.\nThat is why I want to stop and share our experience that could save lives in other places on the planet, just as the experience of China, Cuba and Russia has done with us.\nOur social and health protection system allows us to go house to house to look for positive cases and to attend to suspicious or potential cases. We count on it; with the medical missions and the automatized protection system called Patria Web System, where more than 20 million citizens, adults, of a population of 30 million inhabitants, are registered, equivalent, as you can see, to more than two thirds of the population. This territorial system has allowed us to reach all the communities in our country. We have our own model, designed on the principle of prioritizing the lives of all equally. Thanks to this, we have been able to combine a healthy distance with the productive life of the country. We have called it the \u201cSeven by Seven System\u201d and we make it available to all nations, with the modesty that characterizes us. Seven days: a week of shelter in the homes, of deep quarantine, and seven days, a week of economic flexibility, broad and general; which ensures the implementation of a new normality, until we can overcome this pandemic.\nOur government has prepared to face this challenge together with our people; we have the superior level of awareness that the Venezuelan population has accumulated and the efficiency of our public health system. In this way, we have been able to control the first signs of this pandemic that has battered the world, gaining time to improve all the protocols for prevention, treatment and protection of our people.\nVenezuela is one of the few countries to apply free and differentiated treatment for the cases detected: asymptomatic, mild symptomatic, moderate symptomatic and severe symptomatic. Our policy of prevention and attention implies the total hospitalization of all positive cases, even when they do not present symptoms. This has prevented us from the exponential expansion of this disease.\nMr. President,\nMore than $30 billion dollars have been taken from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, frozen and held in bank accounts in the United States and Europe. Likewise, any company or government that commercializes any good or service with our country be food, medicine, fuel, additives needed to produce gasoline \u2014 which our people need \u2014 etc., is being persecuted.\nThat is why we ratify to the world that Venezuela has prepared to resist and is resisting this offensive of criminal, inhumane aggression. Venezuela has prepared to overcome this blockade by the government of the United States of North America. It is a battle for pace, for our Homeland, for the region, for humanity. Our heroic Venezuelan people has assumed in the past the responsibility of its historical role before the ignominy of the most dangerous empire of the universal history; an empire that at the same time is writing the most horrifying chapters of inhumanity and criminal imposition. The world must know that we are prepared to fight them with the force of our history, our spirit, reason and international law.\nI wish to reiterate once again our deep appreciation for the pronouncement of both the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, demanding the immediate lifting of unilateral and criminal coercive measures, which are not only contrary to the United Nations Charter, but are clear obstacles imposed on the affected countries to adequately address the COVID-19 pandemic and the compliance with the Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe attacks \u2014 as you know \u2014 are not limited only to the unilateral coercive measures. On May 3rd, Venezuela faced an attempted maritime incursion by a group of mercenaries and terrorists, financed by the government of the United States and trained on Colombian territory, with the total and absolute support of the U.S. and Colombian governments. This group of terrorists was confronted in real time by the civic-military police union, and the perpetrators of this attack, of this armed incursion against Venezuela, were neutralized and captured, and are under the orders of the judicial institutions for due process.\nLikewise, we recently captured an American spy with war weapons and documents related to our oil and electric industry. It is a daily siege that we have been facing, dismantling, denouncing, unveiling one by one.\nAnd I ask myself: How can a terrorist action be qualified in the midst of an extraordinary humanitarian circumstance such as the one we are living with the COVID-19 pandemic? Can humanity qualify it? The least we can say is that the excess has been imposed, which is the most terrible sin that seems to have taken over completely the North American elites.\nThat is why the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reiterates the need to vindicate the principles of respect for sovereignty, for the self-determination of the peoples, expressed in the United Nations Charter, which unite us all, whose illegal violation by some Member States of this Organization, motivated by ignoble reasons, is endangering the stability of our country and the Latin-Caribbean region.\nIt is necessary that the countries that defend peace activate themselves and make the Government of the United States understand that, in the midst of a pandemic, no one understands nor explain that there is an upsurge of criminal prosecution, of the blockade against noble countries such as Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Syria, Iran and other brotherly countries of the world. For this reason, we must demand the cessation of all unilateral coercive measures, of all the alleged sanctions, and that they allow our peoples exercise their own rights, the right to development and peace. The United States and its Government must abandon the old practice of criminalizing those of us who do not subordinate to their orders in this world and maintain, as we do it, a policy of independence and sovereignty. The United States \u2014 we must say this \u2014 in the course history, has become the most serious threat to peace in this world.\nWe wish to endorse the words of the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, on the ceasefire and cessation of conflicts in the world, reiterating unrestricted respect and full adherence to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and international law, in particular, respect to sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of States, dialogue among nations, the peaceful resolution of disputes and the prohibition of the threats or use of force as such.\nMr. President,\nVenezuela has traditionally been a host country of refugees and migrants. However, as a direct consequence of the criminal unilateral coercive measures and the economic aggressions imposed by the government of the United States on our people, a process of migration of citizens has taken place, fundamentally for economic reasons.\nNevertheless, at present, our country is facing and experiencing a wave of voluntary, massive returns of thousands of Venezuelan migrants, from the countries with very high levels of COVID-19 infections, such as Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Brazil, motivated by different reasons, the most important being the failure of COVID-19 management in those countries. Secondly, the systematic violation of the human rights of Venezuelan migrants, anachronistic and xenophobic policies against migrants of our country, including from high levels of government in those countries; discrimination, mistreatment, lack of socio-economic conditions, a situation of semi-slavery, human trafficking, calamities that our migrants have suffered in clear violation of their human dignity. What has been the reaction of the world - we wonder - that says to be concerned for Venezuela in the face of these reprehensible facts: complicit silence.\nAs we said, the COVID-19 pandemic has catalysed the already unsustainable living conditions of thousands of migrants in the so-called host countries, who have reported the worsening of abandonment and the lack of response and attention from the authorities in those countries. The fragility of the social protection systems of these countries has become evident, and they are sometimes presented as social and economic models. And we wonder once again, how is it possible, despite the great amount of dollars that have been given to these governments through extravagant donor recruitment conferences for Venezuelan migrants? What did they do with that money? Did these governments steal it? We believe that we must certainly review, with institutional and scientific rigour the role that some United Nations Agencies, or some people from some Agencies, have been playing in these processes, such as UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration (IOM).\nMr. President,\nFor the sake of the reconciliation and complying with the agreements reached in the National Dialogue Table between the Venezuelan political forces, in September 2019, a series of measures have been adopted to benefit and guarantee democracy in Venezuela. Recently, 110 citizens belonging to right-wing opposition groups were pardoned and prosecuted for several crimes related to aggression against our country. With this decision, we seek to continue building the path towards national reconciliation, understanding that peace deserves all efforts and we will not cease, Mr. President, in our commitment to this task.\nIn faithful compliance with the provisions established in our National Constitution, approved in a referendum by the Venezuelan People in December 1999, the 25th democratic election in 20 years will be held next Sunday, December 6th, 2020. This time, to renew the Legislative Power, with the participation of more than 14,400 candidates, from more than 107 political organizations from the entire national ideological spectrum.\nIn Venezuela, I can tell you, there are all the necessary guarantees to hold the parliamentary elections and that is why we have invited the world to join us, to be witnesses of a living democracy, nothing and nobody will be able to take away from the Venezuelan people the right to elect the new Legislative Power, since this is a fundamental tool for collective existence and will be an expression of the will of the original power. No one decides for us Venezuelans; we do not intervene nor do we intend to do so in any case \u2014 ever \u2014 before any other nation, we are respectful and thus we demand respect.\nEven so, the Government of Washington, which has led its own people to the collapse of the pandemic \u2014 which, by the way, will hold presidential elections next November, in blatant violation of international law, illegally imposed new unilateral coercive measures against the Venezuelan democratic institutions, in this case, the Electoral Power, to try to interfere with the conduct of the parliamentary election provided for in our Constitution. This is why, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reiterates the need to vindicate the principles of respect to sovereignty and self determination of the peoples, expressed in the United Nations Charter, whose illegal violation by some Member States of this Organization is intended to lead Venezuela to violence and conflict. We will not allow it. We demand respect. The Venezuelan path is of peace, democracy, freedom, vote, participation and protagonism of the people. That is how it has been, and that is how it will be.\nMr. President,\nAuthorities of the world,\nHeads of State, Heads of Government,\nHere is Venezuela standing. With its historical dignity, in peace. Ready for new challenges; ready for new victories. I bid you farewell, wishing for union, peace and cooperation of the whole world.\nThank you very much."

        "file_text": "Mr. President\nIt is an honor to address this Assembly today. We all wish we could be in New York now \u2014 and benefit from the unique opportunity that High-Level week offers to engage with colleagues, to present our initiatives, to exchange views. Given the challenging circumstances, there can be no question that the decision to hold this meeting in virtual format this year is right. My delegation in New York was among those who presented the very first General Assembly resolution adopted after the lockdown, supported by an unprecedented number of cosponsors.The central message of that resolution was solidarity in the time of the pandemic. Today, I want to offer a message of solidarity to the city of New York which was hit very hard by the pandemic, has shown remarkable resilience and has been an outstanding host for us throughout.\nMr. President\nThe ongoing pandemic is a difficult and humbling experience for all of us. The temptation to wish for the quickest possible return to status quo ante is very strong and is understandable. But the sober reality is that there is no way of going back to where we were. The pandemic has changed our reality and living conditions globally in a fundamental manner and had a profound impact. Most importantly perhaps, it has exacerbated the existing inequalities, both within and among nations. Health care, education and stability in income are the most obvious areas in this respect. And those who were at a disadvantage before the pandemic have often been hit the hardest and suffered additional setbacks. Overcoming the crisis is therefore an enormous challenge \u2014 but also a unique opportunity. Only in creating better living conditions for more people will we be able to be better prepared and to enhance our collective resilience. The Decade for Action takes on additional significance in this respect, as the 2030 Agenda provides us with the perfect framework for building back better. Had we done better in achieving the goals reflected in the 2030 Agenda \u2014 from gender equality to health care, from inequality to climate change \u2014 we would have been much better prepared to fight the pandemic effectively and in a spirit of genuine solidarity. Focusing on the 2030 Agenda must therefore be on the very top of our agenda for this session and beyond.\nMr. President\nEven before the pandemic started the Secretary-General identified erosion of trust in institutions and the rule of law as a major risk for peaceful societies. I shared his concern then, and our recent experience strengthens our belief in the need for strong and accountable institutions which has been a common theme in the analytical reporting on the impact of the pandemic. Only where high levels of trust in institutions exist, can the response to the pandemic be coordinated, unified and effective. Lack of access to the relevant institutions, inequality in treatment and corruption fundamentally undermine such trust and must be important entry points for our collective response. We will continue giving the highest priority to challenges to the rule of law and the implementation of SDG 16. The upcoming Special Session of this Assembly on corruption becomes even more relevant against the background of the pandemic. More broadly though, the fight for the rule of law at the international level remains a central task for us.\nMr. President\nThe United Nations itself is one of the finest triumphs of the rule of law. 75 years ago, States embraced a set of common rules, reflected in the provisions of the UN Charter, and agreed to solve conflicts jointly and peacefully, to subject the use of force to very tight and strict rules and to embrace the primacy of international law. More than ever today, we are conscious of the central importance of this message and realize to what extent we can benefit from the effort to build back better after the Second World War. But more than ever, also, are we confronted with the reality that there is a trend among some of our partners to question the centrality of the rule of law and indeed the need to tackle threats to international peace and to our planet collectively. We hope that this gathering, held in an imperfect format, will result in a resounding collective and unequivocal commitment to multilateralism and to the rule of law. Adhering to the rules that we have agreed on, the respect for international law, is of central importance for small States, who make up the majority of the membership in this house. We defined the strengthening of international law as one of our priorities when we joined the United Nations 30 years ago. Liechtenstein will continue to stand up for the rule of law and for multilateralism. In particular we will continue promoting the respect for the rules that govern the use of force between States \u2014 the Charter provisions are clear in this respect, but they are increasingly diluted in practice, in particular through the manner in which the rules concerning self-defense are interpreted. This is particularly dangerous in an era of increased militarization and of cyberwarfare. We are working with our partners to help develop a clear understanding how international law applies to the cybersphere.\nMr. President\nEnforcement has often been a weak spot even in the proudest achievements of treaty-making. For decades, we have had high and universal human rights standards, first reflected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For way too many around the globe, however, these standards are in stark contrast with the often cruel reality of their daily lives. A decisive step forward in the enforcement of international law was the creation of the International Criminal Court: It was set up to ensure that the crimes considered to be the most serious under international law do not go unpunished. Ensuring accountability was a task assigned first and foremost to the national justice systems who have the responsibility to investigate and prosecute. Only where States fail to fulfil their obligations does the ICC have a role, as a court of last resort. The international criminal justice project, with the ICC at its heart, has been remarkably successful. Almost two thirds of the UN membership have joined its founding treaty, and innovative accountability mechanisms such as the accountability mechanism for Syria (HIM) have been created in support of accountability efforts. And nevertheless, the Court is under relentless attack: Staff members have been subjected to unprecedented measures simply for doing the work they are mandated to do. The Court as an institution is under constant political attack. We, together with many of our friends, have consistently rejected such measures that are both unacceptable and a dangerous precedent. For the majority of us who support the ICC this is a moment to come together, to forge a clear way ahead, to express unequivocal support for the Court, find practical ways to assist it and to remain faithful to the Rome Statute.\nMr. President\nIf the ICC is of crucial importance to enforce respect for international law, that same can be said of the Security Council. Sadly, the Council is failing in this task on a regular basis. Time and again, it proves unable to enforce respect for international humanitarian law, to prevent mass atrocities and to see to it that the law governing the use of force is observed. The Council continues to apply an outdated notion of security which hampers the relevance of its work \u2014 and it is paralysed in near permanent political standoffs. In this scenario, the veto power of the five Permanent Members has a pervasive pernicious effect. For multilateralism to be operational, we need to be able to take action also where the Council finds itself in a deadlock \u2014 in this Assembly. Where the action of the General Assembly has been limited in the past, it was by choice, not by law. As a function of the Security Council\u2019s failures to deliver, often due to the veto power, the responsibility of the General Assembly to step up and address these matters increases. We therefore believe that the General Assembly should meet and discuss every instance of a veto cast in the Security Council.\nMr. President\nThe pandemic is the defining challenge our time \u2014 in addressing its various dimensions, climate change and its manifold devastating effects have to be at the very center of our response. Enormous work has been done to design solutions that help us fight climate change. The Paris agreement was reached after painstaking and arduous negotiations. Hailed as a breakthrough by most, it was received with skepticism by others who criticized its largely voluntary nature. Today it seems that the Paris agreement is not sufficient to save the planet from ourselves. Too many States, in particular some with vast impact on our collective C02 outputs, have not taken commitments sufficient to change course. We are far off the trajectory charted in Paris and in fact on track to reach unsustainable levels of global warming even earlier than projected. There is hope that we have not run out of time yet. But we are certainly doing so quickly. The effort necessary now must include not only the Governments assembled here, but also the private sector, civil society and in particular the voices of young people who are rightfully asking to be part of the decision-making that will have a profound impact on their lives.\nMr. President\nThe inequality gap is one of the biggest challenges in achieving the SDG\u2019s. This gap has widened dramatically and rapidly as a result of the pandemic, with devastating effect, both individually and collectively. Forced labor, as the most prevalent expression of modern slavery and human trafficking, has been the focus of our SDG work for a number of years now. Together with our partners \u2014 both Governments and private sector partners - we have set up the FAST initiative to help fight what is both a global human rights crisis and massively undermines the 2030 Agenda. Modern slavery and human trafficking make up one of the most profitable organized crime models. FAST stands for Finance Against Slavery and Trafficking and identifies tools for financial institutions to play an effective part in fighting these crimes \u2014 in the areas of compliance, responsible investment and financial innovation. The pandemic has made this work only more relevant. We are fully committed to continuing our work to implement FAST, both within in the UN system and beyond.\nWe are celebrating this year the 30th anniversary of our membership in the United Nations. Joining this organization was an essential step for our sovereignty, for a more assertive and independent foreign policy. The UN membership has solid support in our population, but also comes with expectations that we must work hard to meet. During the pandemic, people all over the world have instinctively looked for the United Nations to offer solutions and show a way forward. Not all these expectations have been met, while the specialized agencies in particular have done tremendous work. We will continue our political investment in the United Nations. We will continue being a voice that promotes the rule of law. And we will do our part to ensure that the intergovernmental bodies are also fit for the upcoming challenges. One element the pandemic has impressively underlined is the need for this Assembly to fully function at all times, in particular in times of crisis. We commend the effort and good will of all during these unprecedented restrictions for our core multilateral forum. But we have a collective duty to prepare better for the next time. The inclusive and universal nature of the General Assembly is too important for it to fall into paralysis when it is most needed. We therefore undertake, together with many partners, to equip the General Assembly with all the tools necessary so it can implement its mandate even in the most difficult of circumstances, including through voted decisions. This Assembly is as strong as we want it to be, and should be as strong as we need it to be to justify the trust put into the United Nations by the peoples it was created to serve. Liechtenstein is fully committed to earning and increasing that trust, and to working together with all interested States represented in this historical hall.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, Excellencies,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nOn behalf of the Government of the Republic of San Marino, I would like to congratulate H.E. Volkan Bozkir on his election as President of the 75th Session of the UN General Assembly and to wish him a fruitful work.\nThe Republic of San Marino supports the priorities of your programme mentioned in your inaugural address and ensures you, Mr. President, full cooperation in all works of the General Assembly. I would like to express my country\u2019s gratitude to the outgoing President, H.E. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, for the important work carried out during the 74th Session. I would also like to extend my special thanks to the Secretary-General, H.E. Antonio Guterres, for his energy and determination in leading the United Nations in this very difficult and challenging time.\nMr. President,\nI am grateful for the theme chosen for this Session: \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism \u2014 confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action\u201d. This theme gives Member States the opportunity to constructively contribute to the work of the General Assembly. The COVID-19 pandemic is probably one of the most arduous challenges in the history of the United Nations. Surely, it is the most violent blow that my country had to endure \u2014 and is still enduring \u2014 in a long time. One which we will not forget. San Marino was among those countries more severely affected by the pandemic. While the virus has not caused deaths in the last months in my country, this is no reason for celebrations. San Marino remains one of the countries which suffered the highest rates of infections in the world, with dramatic consequences on our community.\nThe immense effort needed to contrast the health emergency and the global economic contraction resulted in an unprecedented structural challenge for my country. If we will succeed in re-establishing previous levels of wealth and health it will only be through international solidarity and tremendous efforts of our people\nUnfortunately, we are not alone.\nThe coronavirus is continuing to spread across the world, hitting one country after the other, infecting millions of people, taking hundreds of thousands of lives. Moreover, COVID-19 is causing a widespread fear about our future. The pandemic is not only a health crisis, but also a humanitarian and security crisis, which has accentuated pre-existing structural problems within and among nations, The coronavirus assailed communities around the world and drove the global economy into a downturn whose long-term effects cannot yet be fully assessed. The human impacts of lockdowns and suspensions of social and economic activities are and will be disproportionately felt by the most vulnerable countries and groups, including indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities, persons with disabilities, women and children. Inadequate health systems; gaps in social protection; structural inequalities; environmental degradation; the climate crisis: the pandemic is showing us the fragility of our world. The United Nations not only leads on the response to the health crisis, but is also expanding the means for lifesaving humanitarian assistance and establishing instruments for rapid responses to the socio-economic impact.\nIn this respect, San Marino welcomed the Strategic preparedness and response Plan to address immediate health needs, which has been produced by WHO, the Global Humanitarian Response Plan to ease the impacts in over 63 highly vulnerable countries, and the UN COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund, for the socioeconomic response and recovery in middle- and lower-income countries. The Republic of San Marino supported the UN Secretary-General\u2019s call for a global cease-fire, issued on 23 March, which urges warring parties in all corners of the world to pull back from hostilities. Moreover, my Country joined the Secretary General\u2019s global call emphasizing the need for an end to all violence against women everywhere, including in the home.\nMr. President,\nSan Marino co-sponsored the GA resolution Global Solidarity to Fight COVID-19, by which the United Nations General Assembly, the universal body of nations, sent a strong message of unity, solidarity and international cooperation. We also supported through a co-sponsorship the resolution named International Cooperation to ensure global access to medicines, vaccines and medical equipment to face COVID-19, which highlights the importance of international cooperation and underscores that equitable access to health products is a global priority. During the last months we also joined several collective declarations. In Response to the UN Secretary-General\u2019s Call on Countries to Prioritize Children\u2019s Education, Food, Health and Safety amid the COVID-19 Pandemic, we co-signed the joint declaration Protect our children, by which we stated that it is vital to work together to prevent and mitigate the risks all children face. We need to ensure for all children access to inclusive and quality education, nutrition and health care, as well as strengthen social protection systems. We must prevent and combat all forms of violence, including domestic violence, abuse and sexual exploitation of children online and offline, cyberbullying, and bridge the digital divide. Being part of the Group of Friends of Children and Armed Conflict, San Marino welcomed the positive results in our common cause of ending and preventing grave violations against children in armed conflict. In this regard, I would like to thank Ms. Virginia Gamba and her staff, who, with great dedication, have finalized a terrific number of action plans and commitments also in the last year. But despite the successful results, we have to recognize that great concerns remain.\nThe number of verified violations against children is still very worrying and education, which should be one of our priorities, is still under attack. We are particularly worried about the impact of the COVID-19 on vulnerable groups such as children in armed conflicts.\nSan Marino joined the collective declaration regarding the impact of COVID 19 on older persons. We believe it is important to promote and respect the dignity and rights of older people and to mitigate the negative impacts during and after the COVID-19 pandemic on their health, lives, rights and wellbeing. Moreover, we recognize important contributions that older persons make to our societies, and call for their participation in the responses to the pandemic. My Country also co-sponsored the joint declaration Disability-inclusive response to COVID-19 \u2014 Towards a better future for all. During the pandemic, persons with disabilities have experienced greater attitudinal, environmental and institutional barriers and discrimination, exclusion from accessing health-care services and information, as well as faced serious disruption to their employment, education, and access to social protection and other support services. The global response and recovery should be disability- inclusive, it should protect the rights and needs of persons with disabilities and place them at the center of all our efforts, as envisaged in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nIn this regard, I\u2019m pleased to say that the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights included the COVID-19 guidance on triage of the Bioethics Committee of the Republic of San Marino among the so-called \u201cpromising practices\u201d.\nMr. President,\nAlong with this pandemic, we have to draw our attention to the challenge of the misinformation and disinformation pandemic. The spread of the \u201cinfodemic\u201d can put our health at risk, it can increase the risk of conflicts, violence, human rights violations and mass atrocities. The COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated the crucial need for access to free, reliable, trustworthy, factual, clear and science-based information. States, regional organizations, the UN system and other stakeholders such as media workers, social media platforms and NGOs have a clear role and responsibility in helping people to deal with the \u201cinfodemic\u2019. My Country attaches great importance to the fight against disinformation. For this reason, we organized in 2019, in San Marino, a High-Level Conference on the Dangers of Disinformation. For the same reason, we joined this year the Cross-Regional Statement on \u201cInfodemic\u201d in the Context of COVID-19 supporting the United Nations Communications Response initiative and the \u201cVerified\u201d campaign announced by the UN Secretary General in April.\nMr. President,\nThe effects of climate change, including increasingly frequent and severe weather phenomena, floods and droughts, diminishing fresh water resources, desertification, land degradation and sea-level rise, are threatening entire populations, depriving them of their livelihoods.\nThese effects of climate change can lead inter alia to food insecurity, large- scale displacement, and social tensions, exacerbating, prolonging or contributing to the risk of future conflicts. Although greenhouse gas emissions are projected to drop by 6 per cent in 2020, and air quality has improved as a result of travel bans and the economic slowdown resulting from the pandemic, global community is far off track to meet either the 1.5 or 2\u00b0C targets called for in the Paris Agreement. The decade 2010 to 2019 was the warmest decade ever. Governments and private sector must accelerate the transitions to climate relationship with the environment and we make transformational changes in our economies.\nThe reduction of food loss and waste underpins the achievement of sustainable development in its three dimensions \u2014 economic, social and environmental. Food- related sustainable practices and innovative solutions are instrumental to a number of major and delicate issues, such as poverty alleviation, hunger eradication and human health. San Marino deems crucial to curb food loss and waste, through more sustainable production and consumption practices. In order to achieve this, we must recognise collectively the relevance of these issues, emphasising the need for immediate and effective action. This is why, together with the Principality of Andorra, San Marino in 2019 sponsored the Resolution which designates 29 September as the International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste.\nToday we celebrate for the first time this anniversary and I would like to take this opportunity to urge you all to join us \u2014 if you have not done so already \u2014 in aimed at raising awareness of the importance of reducing food loss and waste and the contribution of these actions to sustainable development.\nMr. President,\n75 years after its foundation, the United Nations is facing the most difficult challenge of its history. We must stop this pandemic and we will succeed only if we work together, because this is a collective effort that requires a renewed and stronger multilateral cooperation.\nIn this context, we need to accelerate the pace and scale of our actions, if we want to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. San Marino strongly supports the decade of action launched by the Secretary General at the beginning of this year. We believe that, while the crisis is endangering progress towards the SDGs, it also offers a unique opportunity for pursuing a transformative recovery from COVID-19, which leads us to build more inclusive societies based on sustainable development where no one is left behind. Our response to the pandemic must be based on a new social contract that respects the rights and freedoms of all and provides equal opportunities for all. Recent developments in the global political landscape have created obstacles to the development of multilateralism and are putting it at risk. The challenges posed today by protectionism and isolationism must and can be countered by international cooperation and the rules of international law, which have guided Member States for decades. It is essential to preserve the values of multilateralism and international cooperation, which underpin the United Nations Charter and Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development in order to promote and support peace and security, development and human rights. San Marino is among the strongest advocates for the rules-based multilateralism.\nIn conclusion, Mr. President,\nToday more than ever, we believe it is fundamental to reaffirm our commitment to the values and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, signed in San Francisco 75 years ago.\nA stronger multilateralism is essential if we want to build fair, just and peaceful societies, where young people can live in dignity, women can have the same opportunities as men, and where all minorities and vulnerable groups are protected.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "I add my voice to that of the speakers who have preceded me in congratulating you on your election as President of the 75th regular session of the General Assembly of the United Nations. While assuring you of the support of my country, I express for you and for your Office my best wishes for success in the accomplishment of your mandate.\nI would also like to salute the remarkable work accomplished by Ambassador Tidjani Mohamed-BANDE, your predecessor, who, despite a difficult environment, was able, with skill, to carry through to its conclusion the examination of files as complex as they are varied.\nI would like to reiterate the confidence of my country in the action and the efforts which the Secretary General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, has deployed since his assumption of the leadership of our Organization.\nMister President,\nWe are holding this 75th session of the General Assembly in an exceptional and particularly difficult context marked by the coronavirus disease, a pandemic that has caused countless loss of human life, disrupted our economies and hampered the achievement of our efforts to reduce poverty, maintain international peace and security, guarantee justice and human rights, promote social progress, while protecting the environment.\nFaced with this global threat, each country has shown a strong capacity for resilience and found within itself the most inventive ways to raise awareness and protect its population, while cooperating with the rest of the world, that is to say by drawing lessons from experience of others or by sharing with them the progress made in their own country with regard to this disease.\nAs soon as the first case of Covid-19 was detected in Kinshasa on 10 March 2020. My Government immediately took swift and decisive measures to contain the spread of the virus. And, given the severity and the highly contagious and deadly nature of the pandemic, I declared a state of health emergency throughout the national territory after having created a presidential task force and a multisectoral response unit against Covid-19. We have thus succeeded in capitalizing on the achievements of the management of the Ebola epidemic to improve our response capabilities to the overlapping COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn this dynamic, the Government has set up a multisectoral committee and a technical secretariat that has drawn up a structural plan for the response to Covid-19. In order to meet the varied and complex challenges that have been raised by the pandemic in the health, economic and security sectors, I have instructed my Task Force and the Government to work closely together to coordinate the development of the Emergency Multisectoral Pandemic Impact Mitigation Programme, which I personally launched on 18 June 2020.\nI take this opportunity to express my gratitude for the assistance provided to my country by our partners at this particularly difficult time and for their reiterated support for the efforts and coordinated measures taken to date by my Government to combat COVID-19 and beyond. This is how my country, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was able to reduce the case fatality rate of the pandemic from 10% in the first days, to less than 2.5% today.\nThe coherent multilateral coordination provided by the United Nations in general, and the World Health Organization in particular, has succeeded in particular in guaranteeing genuine, efficient and effective international solidarity, and has made it possible to promote greater interaction with our development partners and international financial and economic institutions with a view to mobilizing the resources necessary to fight the pandemic and to help developing countries strengthen their national health systems.\nThe pandemic has shown us that there is only one planet and only one health and that our spells are linked.\nFor the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in order to help developing countries to effectively emerge from the crisis and better ensure post-COVID-19, the efforts of the international community should include the cancellation and other reductions of their debt burden in order to allow them to rebuild better. We welcome the efforts and measures taken by the Group of 20 and the international financial institutions in postponing debt payment deadlines and invite them to take further decisions with a view to its total cancellation. Any such support measures or additional financing for developing countries should not be tied to any conditionality or require certain economic policy reforms, such as austerity measures.\nAlso, I appeal to the international community to strengthen international solidarity, joint efforts, multilateral cooperation and partnership with all developing countries, including in the area of capacity-building and technical assistance, to fight and stop a disease that is our common enemy and demonstrate our ability to work together in solidarity.\nI therefore recognize the leading role of the United Nations in these efforts, including the World Health Organization.\nThis is the main lesson the Covid-19 has tragically taught us. It is true profession of faith in favour of multilateralism with regard to the level of international cooperation in the fight against this pandemic.\nMister President,\nClimate change poses a threat to humans and their fundamental rights, particularly for vulnerable populations. The effects of global warming and the climatic disturbances that accompany it are more and more acutely felt around the world. They are dangerous and accelerating.\nFaced with these threats posed by climate change and environmental degradation, our action in favour of the climate and the green economy as the basis of our future and our development is not simply a necessity but an urgent obligation if we wish to see a peaceful and sustainable future.\nFor its part, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has made binding commitments to reducing its carbon dioxide emissions and mitigating the effects of climate change. We are determined to do everything to achieve the implementation of our commitments in favour of the climate by preserving our forests.\nIn accordance with my promise and the commitment made at the 74th session of the General Assembly, \u201cSchool gardens: a billion trees by 2023\u201d has been established in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This programme, which was adopted by my Government, will begin its activities in the last quarter of this year 2020. It is aimed at achieving a major community and eco-civic project of ecological restoration with strong socioeconomic benefits for the benefit of urban and rural populations. We therefore expect our partners to also respect their financial commitments within the framework of the preservation of tropical forests, in particular that of the green climate fund created in favour of the least developed countries.\nMister President,\nAt the national level, I have engaged the country in reforms at several levels, including that of public finances and the improvement of good governance and poverty reduction.\nEconomically, the Democratic Republic of Congo has made the African Union\u2019s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Agenda 2063 the pivot on which its development policy is based. Since 2016, the country has been implementing the Sustainable Development Goals aimed at inclusion, social equity and transparency at all levels.\nTo that end, my Government has put in place the National Strategic Development Plan, which constitutes the unifying framework of all national, provincial and sectoral policies and strategies on the Sustainable Development Goals in order to enable the Democratic Republic of the Congo to diversify its economy, which remains based on the exploitation of natural resources, and to accelerate investment in infrastructure and human capital, while promoting investment in social sectors.\nHowever, it is true that the current context marked by COVID-19 represents a real challenge that is slowing the pace of the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Also, my Government has developed, as I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, an emergency multisectoral programme to mitigate the impacts of Covid-19 in order to cushion the shock associated with the health crisis on the socioeconomic environment and support the revival of economic activity.jsE.pjMister President,\nThe prevailing security situation in the eastern part of the country remains worrying. Peace is not yet fully established there. Some residual elements of armed groups, nationals and foreigners alike, are still active there and continue to sow death and desolation. They attack not only elements of our armed forces, but also the MONUSCO peacekeepers who provide us with their logistical support, as well as the civilian population, all this with the aim of undermining the efforts made by the Government for the stability of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the region.\nThese armed groups engage in unconventional and asymmetric warfare. They act in total ignorance of human values and commit massive abuses and violations of human rights, in particular through repeated rapes and massacres of civilian populations in isolated corners of certain well-known territories in the east of the country, such as of the Beni region and its surroundings, Djugu in Ituri and Rutshuru.\nThe findings show in general that these groups have the means to enable them to pursue their activities. These means often come from the illicit exploitation of natural resources sold outside the Democratic Republic of the Congo through well- established networks and, without a doubt, with the help of certain sponsors. We cannot, in fact, succeed in neutralizing the armed groups without eradicating their sources of supply and support, which are these networks and other sponsors. I appeal to the international community to apply appropriate, targeted and effective sanctions.\nMr. President, it is in this general context that the strategic review and dialogue for the transformation of the UN presence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is taking place.\nUntil we can agree on the final contours of the future of MONUSCO on the national territory, the wish of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is to see, during this period of preparation for withdrawal, the strengthening of collaboration on the field within MONUSCO units and with the FARDC in order to ensure that the expected firepower to protect the population and restore peace, security and the full authority of the State throughout the national territory, including in localities where the presence of armed groups is still visible, can be effective.\nI am resolved to restore a smile as soon as possible to the populations of the east of my country, who have been living in insecurity for more than two decades. To that end, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is in favour of the principle of increasing the operational capacity of the Intervention Brigade, in particular by providing it with special units adapted to the asymmetric warfare imposed on us by armed groups in the east of the country.\nMister President,\nThe agenda in favour of improving the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is one of the priorities of my Government which, since my inauguration, has been engaged in the fight against counter-values and human rights abuses, in particular through the fight against impunity and sexual violence, access to justice for victims, the improvement of prison conditions, and the resolution of intercommunity violence, in particular through the creation and implementation of transitional justice mechanisms.\nAlways in the quest to improve the situation of human rights and social justice in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on 22 April 2019 I established the Agency for the Prevention and Fight against Trafficking in Persons and the National Committee for the Prevention of Torture.\nTo put an end to certain bad practices in the management of public affairs and to fight effectively against corruption, fraud and counter-values, I created an agency for the prevention and fight against corruption that will make it possible to strengthen corruption prevention policy with regard to those in charge of both the executive and the private sector.\nMister President,\nSince the beginning of my mandate, I have continuously ramped up the efforts of my Government in favour of the promotion and protection of the rights of women and young girls. I realize how much this category of the Congolese population has particularly suffered from the horrors of the troubled years that my country has gone through. It is to combat all forms of sexual and gender-based violence that my country has taken and implemented several legal and administrative texts and taken important initiatives.\nI am aware that, notwithstanding these countless efforts, there is still a lot of work to do in this area. My determination to fight for the rights of women, girls and children remains strong.\nThis is why my country warmly welcomed the creation, on 30 October 2019, of the Global Fund for the reparation of victims of sexual crimes committed during the time of conflict. My Government is prepared, on the one hand, to work in close collaboration with this Global Fund, and, on the other hand, to use the experience of this collaboration to create a national fund for the reparation of victims, which will, I am sure, complete the work of alleviating the suffering of the many Congolese victims.\nMister President,\nThe United Nations should continue to ensure multilateral coordination, consistency and accountability within the system to entrench international solidarity.\nThis is why I reiterate my urgent call for the reform of the United Nations Security Council, in order to make that body more transparent, more democratic and more representative of the composition of our Organization. For more than a decade, we have each year recalled the glaring injustice suffered by the African continent in its representation both within the Security Council and in the various international organizations that make up the United Nations system. The feeling of frustration in the face of this near indifference to this obvious injustice contributes to the accentuation of social and popular frustrations, which sometimes lead to episodes of violence in many countries. The reform of the United Nations must, moreover, draw the lessons of experience in matters of international cooperation in order to ensure the greater efficiency of the agencies and funds engaged in the basics of economic and social development.\nWe must commit to applying concrete measures to make both the eradication of poverty and the reduction of inequalities truly irreversible, promote social inclusion and the environment in a holistic way, strengthen economic and technical cooperation, move forward on the path of solidarity and development and to preserve international peace and security.\nThus, the global village in which we live will be able to reflect international solidarity, respect for human rights and the environment, these values that characterize us.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "Dear Mr. President!\nDear Mr. Secretary General!\nFirst of all, let me congratulate Mr. Volkan Bozkir on his election as President of the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly and wish him success in this responsible position.\nI would like to ask Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande to accept our sincere gratitude for his able and effective work as President of the General Assembly at its 74th session.\nDear participants!\nLadies and gentlemen!\nI want to start my speech with words of deep sorrow for the hundreds of thousands of people who did not survive the coronavirus pandemic.\nI also express my admiration and gratitude to doctors, paramedics, nurses, technical staff, volunteers, all those who have been working selflessly for many months to save lives and health of people in different parts of the world.\nOur eyes are focused with hope and faith on scientists and researchers who are working on vaccines and drugs to stop the pandemic. I address them with gratitude and willingness to provide all possible support in their most important mission.\nYes, today we have to speak first of all about the new danger faced by humanity in the twenty-first century. In a short time, COVID-19 has become a real and perhaps the most threatening challenge of our time. A global challenge that does not recognize borders, races, and nationalities, which has a detrimental effect on all spheres of civilizational development. Perhaps the whole world has felt its vulnerability to a common threat with such severity for the first time in many decades. And we hope and believe that only unity and solidarity can overcome and defeat it and allow mankind to become renewed, wiser, more responsible and farsighted after this battle. And even though the current period is difficult and controversial it gives us a chance to change for the better for the sake of the entire planet\u2019s destiny. It is our highest political and moral duty not to miss this chance, to show dignity, solidarity and true humanism.\nDear Mr. President!\nTurkmenistan has actively began to take the necessary measures to counter this threat from the very beginning of the spread of the pandemic in the world. Effective protective measures were taken on time, a unified national strategy to combat coronavirus infection was formed, which consists of a set of measures of organizational, legal, financial, economic, medical and sanitary quarantine character.\nOur country has established close international cooperation in bilateral format and through international organizations at the same time.\nFirst of all, it should be noted that Turkmenistan closely cooperates with the United Nations. In this context, we fully support the calls and appeals of the UN Secretary General made in his statements on March 23 and 30 of this year.\nTaking into account the initiatives of the Secretary General, Turkmenistan has approved the National Plan of Preparedness for Prevention and Response to acute infectious diseases at the state level. A Plan of Operational Social and Economic Measures in Turkmenistan to counteract the coronavirus pandemic was also developed and adopted.\nTurkmenistan continues its longstanding and effective partnership with the World Health Organization at the same time. We highly appreciate the role of the WHO in the fight against coronavirus. Their recommendations have shown their validity in our country and serve as important guidelines for the activities of medical and other institutions. We will continue to expand and concretize our cooperation with the World Health Organization and bring it to a systematic, long-term level.\nClose professional coordination and joint efforts of medical and scientific communities around the world are more necessary than ever for a fast victory over the pandemic.\nWe are convinced that today we need comprehensive, systematic and purposeful multilateral cooperation on the problem of dangerous viral diseases, a full launch of scientific diplomacy channels. In this regard, Turkmenistan proposes to consider the development and establishment of appropriate international instruments.\nIn particular, under the aegis of WHO, we consider it appropriate:\n-\tto establish a special programme of the World Health Organization to research\nthe coronavirus genome;\n-\tto develop a multilateral mechanism for pneumonia control;\n-\testablish a Methodological Center for the Treatment and Prevention of Acute\nInfections.\nWe are ready for meaningful communication on implementation of these initiatives with all interested countries and international structures.\nDear participants!\nThe Coronavirus pandemic has a significant negative impact on the course and direction of the global economy and seriously undermines the global community\u2019s efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. In this context, we look forward to intensifying cooperation aimed at restoring economic and trade relations. Today it is necessary to create platforms for putting the global economy on a sustainable growth trajectory. In our opinion, energy, transport, industry and trade should become key areas.\nIn this context, during the 75th session, Turkmenistan intends to intensify its work on the elaboration of international legal instruments of the UN in the field of stability and reliability of energy transit.\nThe issues of cooperation in transport sphere are no less urgent.\nAs one of the initiators of wide international communication on transport issues, Turkmenistan proposes to consider the issue of ensuring stable international transportation during emergency situations. We have prepared the corresponding draft resolution of the General Assembly and submitted it for consideration of the UN member states.\nWe believe that the international conference of ministers of landlocked developing countries planned in Turkmenistan next year will be an effective platform for developing coordinated approaches to this problem.\nThe World Trade Organization should take a proactive role in the work to restore the world economy and promote trade and investment. Having recently obtained observer status in the WTO, Turkmenistan will actively use the opportunities opened in this regard to promote practical measures to overcome quickly the crisis phenomena in the world economy, its transition to positive dynamics.\nDistinguished heads and members of delegations!\nThe coronavirus pandemic has affected to some extent many countries in the world. However, it is seriously dangerous for disadvantaged regions from the perspective of ecology. Unfortunately, there are plenty of such territories on the map and it is impossible to mention all of them in one speech. Therefore, I would like to touch upon the issue, which is highly relevant to the Central Asian states and nations. It is the Aral Sea disaster.\nThe situation is escalating amidst pandemic, it threatens life and health of people and the risk of epidemic outbreak has considerably risen. Under these circumstances we urge the world community to pay close attention to the problems of the Aral Sea and Aral Sea region.\nObviously, the work is under way, substantial work has been done by the UN, while other international organizations have provided assistance to the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea. We thank them all and highly appreciate their work.\nIf I may speak plainly, it is insufficient today. It is necessary to have very detailed work to save the Aral Sea and concrete practical assistance and support should be provided to the people living there. Thus, we strongly believe that, the subject of Aral Sea needs systematic and comprehensive approach as well as relevant legal documents and this issue should be set as a separate direction of the UN activities. In this regard, Turkmenistan has put forward the initiative to create a Special Program for the Aral Sea Basin.\nWe would like to underline the importance of the UN General Assembly resolutions \u201cOn cooperation between the United Nations and the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea\u201d adopted at the initiative our country in April 2018 and May 2019. Today, those resolutions represent the platform for consolidating joint efforts in the Aral Sea area.\nTurkmenistan will present initial draft of the concept and structure of a future special programme on the Aral Sea in the framework of ESCAP sessions in May 2021 as a means of developing international legal foundations to address the Aral Sea issue. We call upon all states and interested international organizations to discuss these documents.\nDistinguished participants!\nThe current General Assembly session takes place amid complex and painful events related to the escalation of military and political rivalry and unfortunately we are witnessing them today. Assessment of these events and their cause and effect relationship may differ. But what is certain is that, they negatively affect overall international situation, erode global security foundations and impede economic, trade and humanitarian relations.\nWe have a deep concern over the disregard for the international law that we witness lately. In view of the current situation it is necessary to consolidate efforts aimed at strengthening the role of international law, multilateral legal instruments in global security system, strict compliance by all states with generally accepted norms deriving from the UN Charter. This is the only way we could sustain stability and predictability in global politics and mitigate the risks of conflicts.\nRestoring trust in international politics and establishing the culture of respectful dialogue are the ways to achieve this objective.\nAs is known, at the initiative of Turkmenistan the UN General Assembly adopted in September last year a resolution declaring the year 2021 as the year of international peace and trust. Turkmenistan puts forward an initiative to organize International forum on peace and trust next year to implement provisions of this resolution. We strongly believe that, this Forum will be able to give a strong impetus to constructive and respectful multilateral dialogue on pressing subjects of modern global agenda.\nDear Mr. President!\nThis year Turkmenistan will mark a significant date in its history. It is the 25th anniversary from the moment that our country institutionalized the status of permanent neutrality in the international community through the UN on 12 December, 1995.\nNeutrality has been one of the foundations of statehood, its internal and foreign policies for a quarter of a century. The principles of neutrality, its values and ideology have proven their full compliance with our national interests and the UN objectives and tasks.\nAnd the UN General Assembly with a large number of member states that became co-authors of this initiative unanimously declared 12 December as the International Day of Neutrality.\nThe neutrality of Turkmenistan is an appeal and condition for equitable, respectful and mutually beneficial international partnership in politics, economy and environment protection, ensuring overall food security, fair and effective distribution of natural resources of the planet, supporting and assisting refugees, migrants and stateless people and addressing many other pressing issues of modern world.\nTurkmenistan\u2019s neutrality is a lofty mission of peacemaking and our states\u2019 readiness to participate in solving all issues emerging in global and regional dimensions through peaceful, political, diplomatic tools and methods.\nPreventive diplomacy is a significant function and integral part of Turkmenistan\u2019s neutrality. It is highly symbolic that the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia was established by the decision of the General Assembly with the support of neighboring states and Security Council members in Ashgabat, the capital city of neutral Turkmenistan in 2007.\nFollowing the logic of neutrality policy Turkmenistan intends to submit the draft resolution \u201cThe role of the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia\u201d for General Assembly\u2019s consideration to ensure regional peace, security, development and unleashing potential of preventive diplomacy.\nPeace, security and development in Central Asia directly depend on the settlement of the situation in Afghanistan. The position of Turkmenistan is principled and remains unchanged. There are no alternatives to the negotiation process. All previous experiences have shown that coercive approaches do not have prospects and fail to lead to agreement and reconciliation. Our country as Afghanistan\u2019s neutral and immediate neighboring state is ready to provide necessary political and organizational conditions in our territory to establish peaceful dialogue between the Government of Afghanistan and all parties interested in political settlement of the situation in Afghanistan.\nWe think that the key condition for political stabilization, social and economic recovery of Afghanistan, its successful integration to global economy is to implement large infrastructure projects with Afghanistan\u2019s involvement primarily in vital sectors such as energy, transport and communications.\nAs is known, our country consistently working in this direction has initiated the construction of a gas pipeline along Turkmenistan Afghanistan-Pakistan-India route, as well as railroads and fiber-optic communication lines with access to the territory of Afghanistan, which have already entered the stage of practical implementation. We call on the international community, business structures, and financial institutions to become more actively involved in this work.\nDistinguished participants!\nThe UN has been and will remain the most important and priority partner for our country. We check all our steps in the international arena with the spirit and letter of the UN Charter. And today, Turkmenistan responsibly declares its unshakable adherence to the great ideals that lie at UN\u2019s foundation in the year of the 75th anniversary of the United Nations. We are convinced that the ideals, values and principles of the UN will remain relevant. The United Nations was and should remain the only international organization with universal legitimacy.\nTurkmenistan strongly believes in the future of the UN and will continue to strengthen and build up strategic partnership with this organization, thereby making its contribution to unlocking its inexhaustible potential in the interests of global peace, security and progress.\nThank you for your attention!"

I remain confident that with concerted efforts and unity of purpose, together we can conquer this pandemic on a global scale.\nThe post-coronavirus landscape will require urgent action to guarantee recovery and to lay a solid foundation for a better world.\nAccordingly, Zambia supports the calls for major interventions such as: (I) debt relief and or cancellation for developing Member States; (II) enhanced collaboration in research for the vaccination and cure of COVID-19; and (III) mobilisation of resources from the local and international community.\nMr. President,\nPrior to the onset of COVID-19, young people were already three times more likely to be unemployed compared to their adult counterparts. As the pandemic pushes the global economy into a deeper crisis, the young generation is once again at risk to disproportionately bear the brunt of mass unemployment and under-protection.\nIn this regard, I wish to share that the Zambian Government launched a multi sectoral youth empowerment programme to support the young entrepreneurs. The multi-sectoral approach has helped ensure that programmes and activities to empower and create employment opportunities for the youth are mainstreamed across all sectors.\nMr. President,\nIn 2015, we the members of the UN pledged to leave no one behind and shift world onto a path of sustainable development prosperity for all. This commitment is indeed still alive to most of us.\nAlthough the road before us is laden with challenges, we should neither waiver, nor surrender to any cynicism on the accelerated implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nFor its part, the Government of the Republic of Zambia, working closely with the and other key stakeholders such as the private sector and civil societies developed the national SDGS coordination framework to guide the implementation, monitoring and reporting on SDGS and integrated it into the country\u2019s national development plan.\nMr. President,\nZambia remains supportive of international efforts aimed at the peaceful resolution of conflicts through advocacy and support shown for peacekeeping missions. Zambia remains an active player in peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations in the region.\nIn this regard, we would like to urge the United Nations to remain resolute in its duty of protecting these vulnerable persons, and to redouble its efforts to bring about a more peaceful world. This is the bedrock of the UN foundation, as espoused by its Charter.\nMr. President,\nAs we mark the 75th anniversary of this, our great institution, we cannot but conclude that, the United Nations\u2019 importance and continued relevance to mankind is beyond question. It is in this context that we need to revitalize it so that it can fulfil the ideals for which it was established.\nI thank you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nDear friends,\nWe will remember this year \u2014 2020. What a year! We cannot meet as we usually do in the Hall, which, once a year, is the centre of our world. New York, which is the most open city in existence, where all our meetings are held, cannot welcome us. For many long weeks, it has been an epicentre of the global health crisis, and I would like to pay special tribute to it here.\nThe COVID-19 crisis has had an impact on everyone and in all areas, including the most prosaic and banal aspects of daily life. How do we visit our loved ones, our family? How do we get to work? How do we cope with online learning? How do we shop? How do we play sports? And these are the concerns of those who have or had a full-time job, social security and access to health care.\nAs Head of Government, I have had to deal with all facets of this crisis and swift decisions had to be taken, with significant consequences on the lives of citizens, the functioning of public services, economic activity and the funding of anti-crisis measures. This remains the common plight of all Governments around the world. But beyond that, all of us, citizens of this planet, are in this crisis together and only together will we emerge from it.\nWe face a global emergency. The crisis has affected all regions of the world almost at the same time. It has been compounded by restrictions on civil liberties, a return of borders, a re-examination of the gains made in the areas of free trade and economic integration and unprecedented challenges to public and private health-care systems, not to mention the ethical issues that many of us have not faced for quite some time.\nAt the beginning of the health crisis, we in Europe acted quickly to protect our national space and that response continues today. The free movement of people in the European Union was also challenged, at times far beyond what would be considered reasonable. The time has come for European action at the health, social and economic levels. Historic decisions have been taken to ensure a way out of the crisis and an environmentally-friendly recovery and to meet the challenges of sustainable development. We will continue to be tested in the coming months but I believe that we will be successful at the national and European levels.\nIn addition to the temptation to focus solely on ourselves, we have also seen an, at times, a level of extraordinary international cooperation between State and institutional actors, in particular in the field of scientific research. Formidable efforts are under way to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. However, only by ensuring equitable global access to a vaccine will we put an end to this pandemic.\nWe have also seen a myriad of concrete examples of solidarity among countries and peoples, for example, in the case of medical evacuations. Responses to the challenges of the severity of the crisis have also led to the improvement and adaptation of medical and health equipment on the ground and to strengthening the resilience of rapid-response systems.\nThat said, we know that, globally, the situation in a large number of countries is of great concern. The COVID-19 crisis has become a health crisis that extends beyond COVID-19 because of the burden it places on health-care systems, and, more generally, because we now question the strategies used to combat other diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS. The disruption of supply chains and obstacles to the distribution of personal protective equipment and other materials have also posed a major challenge. In this regard, I would like to thank the States that helped us acquire personal protective equipment at the height of the crisis.\nMr. President,\nFriends,\nThe dire warnings from the World Food Programme and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs are simply frightening. There is a genuine risk that famine could return in large parts of the world, beyond conflict zones or countries hit by recent natural disasters.\nThe social crisis has a disproportionate adverse effect on the countless people who survive on the informal economy and are deprived of resources in developed economies.\nThe economic crisis affects all countries and in particular developing countries. Emerging countries have not been spared. These countries cannot guarantee the resilience of their social security or health systems in response to the crisis. Nor do they have the means to fund their emergence from the crisis through the capital market. Proportionally, their debt burden is much higher than that of developed countries.\nLuxembourg fully supports efforts to establish a moratorium and reduce the debt burden of the least developed countries.\nFinancing needs are again on the rise for developing countries, whose progress could be rolled back 20 years. However, the means of meeting those needs may be lacking.\nOfficial development assistance must continue to play a key role. In the current circumstances \u2014 all the more so now than prior to the COVID-19 crisis \u2014 assistance cannot be mortgaged with the vagaries of financing through the capital market or other financial instruments, however innovative they may be. I say this even as my country leads in the area of microfinance, in particular in Africa.\nLuxembourg\u2019s official development assistance will remain at 1 per cent of its gross national income, in addition to its international climate and migration expenditure.\nThe role of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda is to ensure financing for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. The initiative of the Secretary-General, together with the Prime Ministers of Canada and Jamaica, to convene a high-level meeting on financing sustainable development post-COVID-19 should be welcomed. It will provide an opportunity to gain a comprehensive overview of an issue that is often addressed piecemeal in forums with very different processes. This does not mean that the proven expertise of institutions, such as the Paris Club or the OECD, should not be revisited and even expanded.\nLuxembourg\u2019s financial centre is fully involved in efforts to develop sustainable financing. The green stock exchange of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is one of the largest and most active in the world. Last week we launched a green bond that has been remarkably successful, with demand 10 times greater than the initial offer.\nWe are now working to extend the climate finance model to other Sustainable Development Goals.\nI just mentioned one of the high-level meetings of this session. There are other meetings at which the representatives of Luxembourg will make a statement or have already made a statement. The event to mark the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, the Summit on Biodiversity and the Beijing +25 meeting are of particular interest.\nWhat does this demonstrate? It shows that even in extremely difficult circumstances, our Organization is capable of consultation, proposals and action.\nAs early as March and April, the Secretary-General submitted a series of COVID-19-related analyses that paved the way for resolutions adopted by the General Assembly.\nMr. President,\nThe Assembly has been able to respond to the challenges posed by the crisis and take decisions that were crucial for the smooth functioning of the Organization thanks to the efforts of your predecessor. In the absence of physical meetings and despite the procedural limitations this entailed, the Assembly has demonstrated to the world that the United Nations was indeed present in meeting the challenges posed by the crisis. The management of the Assembly has set an example on how to sensibly improvise. I believe that, in the future, we will have to consider other arrangements to offset the disadvantages of consensus decision-making.\nOur Assembly has also prepared for the future by adopting a series of substantive resolutions designed to provide a United Nations response to the crisis. The adoption of the Omnibus resolution, which gives coherence to our approach, should be particularly noted and welcomed. At its special session in December, the General Assembly will have the opportunity to review the system\u2019s response and initiatives that might be adopted in the future.\nThe Security Council was somewhat slow to act on our Secretary-General\u2019s call in the early spring for an immediate global ceasefire. Thanks to the persistence of some of its members, it finally did so, but it must be said that the obstacles that were encountered in the process are unfortunately emblematic of the Council\u2019s difficulty to act and make decisions even in the most urgent situations.\nWhile New York-based United Nations agencies, such as UNDP and UNICEF, were of course quick to react, so were United Nations agencies based elsewhere. I am thinking of those based in Rome that had to act to address the food emergency and the emerging danger of starvation.\nRecent experiences in global health governance can and should be reviewed in the aftermath of the current pandemic, and the relevant key lessons should be learned. The World Health Organization (WHO) is the appropriate agency to conduct such a review. Its role in global health governance needs to be strengthened. We are confident that that will enable us to better deal with future pandemics.\nMr. Chairman,\nDear friends,\nI said earlier that the world is in danger of undoing 20 years of development with regard to a significant number of Members of the Organization. Unfortunately, I do not see those as the only achievements at risk. The COVID-19 crisis has further incentivized curtailing civil liberties excessively. In many regions and States, civic space is shrinking dramatically. The suppression of opponents and human rights defenders is becoming widespread. When it is suppressed, civil society is often not heard. At the General Assembly during its seventy-fourth session, the Luxembourg chairmanship of the Third Committee committed to ensuring that civil society receive its rightful place in that forum, which is responsible for dealing with human rights issues. Civil Society\u2019s involvement in United Nations forums will be one of our priorities as a candidate in the Human Rights Council elections to be held in October 2021.\nOverall, we are concerned about the rise of authoritarianism, to our dismay, in every region of the world \u2014 which is at times manifests itself more covertly and deviously, and, at others, openly, as we have recently seen in Belarus. The rise of authoritarianism often goes hand in hand with a rise in simplistic populist, and even anti-scientific and irrational, narratives.\nUnfortunately, backsliding in the progress made in the recognition of certain rights also affects sexual and reproductive health, spilling over into United Nations bodies. With regard to my country, which is pursuing a feminist foreign policy, maintaining the gains made over many years of struggle must remain an absolute priority. We demonstrated that during our recent chairmanship of the Commission on Population and Development.\nI also take this opportunity to recall my country\u2019s commitment to defending the rights of sexual minorities and its active participation in the LGBTI Core Group. In that regard, Europe is unfortunately of concern.\nMr. President,\nAuthoritarianism fuels conflicts as it thrives on them. One has only to look at the number of regions and countries that have become the arena of diverse geographic Powers, entailing all kinds of trafficking and migratory pressures, especially in the Mediterranean.\nThe Middle East remains a hotbed of tension. I welcome the recent rapprochement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Bahrain, which should help stabilize the region. Nevertheless, the peace process between Israel and Palestine has stalled. The parties\u2019 commitment is needed to negotiate a just and lasting peace and reach a two-State solution living side by side in peace and security. While Iran\u2019s actions in the region give cause for concern, the abandonment of the nuclear agreement with Iran is not likely to improve the situation. The agreement remains in force and cannot be simultaneously rejected and invoked.\nLet me say a few words about the situation in West Africa and the Sahel. Much of my country\u2019s international cooperation is focused there. All stakeholders of the region must come together by implementing the commitments made, including the restoration of civil authority in Mali. The effectiveness of the international community\u2019s commitment is predicated on that. For its part, Luxembourg further strengthened its commitment at the beginning of the year through its direct participation in MINUSMA, the first such involvement since its participation in UNPROFOR and UNIFIL.\nI will not list the concerns that my country has about active or potential conflicts in every region of the world. The list would be too long. It must be noted that sources of tension are on the rise and that the appearance of new actors on the international scene hardly always leads towards calm.\nCalling into question multilateralism is playing its role in increasing risks. It is more and more frequent and is not the product a single actor of the international community, as one would like to make us believe on occasion. For our part, we adhere to an international order based on the rule of law and the sovereignty of States. There is no contradiction between the two.\nI take this occasion to reiterate my country\u2019s full support for the International Criminal Court and its representatives. The recent attacks against the Court and obstacles created to prevent it from acting must cease.\nThe United Nations is the umbrella organization of the international system and, as such, the guarantor of multilateralism. In our globalized and interdependent world, isolated and uncoordinated action constitutes a risk for all, including those who do not feel bound by accepted norms. The coronavirus crisis reminds us of that in the clearest and most unmistakable way.\nFor its part, Luxembourg will maintain its long-standing international commitment through its participation in the work of the universally participatory bodies of the Organization, its voluntary financial contributions, its presence on the ground together with the United Nations and its candidature to elected positions in various bodies, such as the Human Rights Council for the term from 2022 to 2024.\nI sincerely hope that next year I will once again be able to participate more directly in the great conversation that is the high-level week and address the Assembly in a more lively and interactive way.\nMr. President,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nDear friends,\nI thank everyone for their kind attention and for listening to me, and I hope to see everyone physically once again in the very near future."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates and Friends,\nSeventy-Five years ago, our predecessors founded this noble institution as the primary international platform to promote dignity, security, and freedom for all. Crafted in the midst of seething political tensions and the immense human suffering wrought by preceding global wars, our United Nations has served as humanity\u2019s most credible attempt at securing a peaceful and prosperous future for all nations and peoples. Yet, as we convene today against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 the likes of which we have not experienced in over a century \u2014 the future we want and we all rightfully deserve, appears in grave jeopardy.\nAmidst the rising tides of Climate Change; the scourge of desertification and land degradation, including in the Sahel; the challenges to biodiversity; the social, political and economic inequities of the global economy; and the uneveness and contradictions of a lopsided multilateral system in which the norms and rules are conveniently applied and upheld in favour of the powerful, the bellowing calls for global reform and a renewed multilateralism reverberate ever more loudly. We are indeed at an important crossroad. A well-functioning United Nations, fit for the purpose of safeguarding the bedrock principles of sovereign equality, territorial integrity, and political independence of all states, while addressing the critical issues of our times, is urgently needed.\nMr. President,\nCOVID-19 has laid bare the indisputable fact that coordinated multilateral action to achieve the sustainable development goals is the surest pathway to global peace and security. In our increasingly interconnected and hyper-globalised world, we protect ourselves when we safeguard our neighbours. Indeed, peace and security are the ideals of a collective identity, moulded through stable relationships. The urgent challenges of our times cannot be solved by building walls, nor can they be effectively addressed by retreating to a corner of nationalistic isolationalism. We must build bridges. And we must stand shoulder to shoulder with our brothers and sisters throughout the world as we lift each other up from COVID-19. In this regard, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines pays tribute to all frontline workers and first responders \u2014 our \u201cCapeless Heroes\u201d \u2014 whose selfless contributions and sacrifices have kept many of us safe throughout this pandemic. We also extend our sympathies to the many families who have endured suffering throughout this ordeal. We stand with you as you honour the memories of your loved ones. We must \u201cKeep the Faith\u201d, and more.\nMr. President,\nThe simple truth is that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a profoundly altered condition of life, living, and production. None of the awesome challenges arising from this altered condition can be solved by incrementalism or a minimalist pragmatism which merely tinkers with the pre-existing poltical economy. To be sure, human ingenuity and science will produce a vaccine within the next few months or a year and the COVID rate of infection, hospitalisation and deaths will come down globally.\nBut haunting questions remain: Would the vaccine be available cheaply and universally to all peoples the world over? Or would its distribution be so skewed within, and across countries, that there is likely to arise a deafening roar that: \u201cOnly Rich Lives Matter?\u201d The good intentions of our United Nations and its specialised agencies such as the World Health Organisation may nibble away at the inequity of a skewed outcome but their impacts are likely to be only marginal unless there is an enforceable, international rules-based compact between all countries and major pharmaceutical companies to deliver universally and affordably the fruits of science and human ingenuity. It cannot be the usual result of corporate profits ahead of people\u2019s lives, livelihoods, social solidarity, and security.\nEven if, in this instance of COVID-19, the international community rises to the challenge and confirms that faith and good intentions without practical works is an illusion, would this be only an episodic response which leaves the pre-existing global order in place until the next, and inevitable, pandemic arises? This irrational dangerous cycle has to be reconfigrured with a global consensus not merely to \u201cbuild back better\u201d but to build back optimally and enduringly for all of humanity\u2019s sake.\nFundamentally, Mr. President, the old order is passing away before our very eyes as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, but a new one is yet to come into being; indeed, there is not in place even a transition to a better, optimal, and enduring condition. We are still quarelling about inconsequential matters, insisting on too many sideshows, and casting our gaze askance away from the main events, metaphorically.\nIt is a truism, repeatedly ignored by powerful nations globally and ruling classes in dominant countries, that our central global challenges cannot be solved in isolation of each other or only on the terms of the powerful. Yet the old reflexes kick in, harming inevitably the strong and the weak, though not in equal measure. So, we end up, metaphorically, with a proud man who is ignorant of that which he is most assured.\nRight reason and mature reflection teach that over the past 50 years of the dominant human civilization, and its appending off-shoots, there has been an explosion of individualism and freedom engendered by a huge enlargement of personal, financial, technological, and social spaces. Atomised individualism has been elevated as the appotheosis of progress; and social solidarity has become frayed, tattered, and diminished as a public good. So, along comes a pandemic and the atomised individual has to rely on the prudent and collective good behaviour of his neighbors to stay healthy. This circle cannot be easily squared in an individualistic, dog-eat-dog social order; and, metaphorically, all hell has broken loose.\nThus, internally in our societies, we ought in the current altered condition, to build a social individual, not an atomised one; this social individual necessarily, has to be grounded in the requisite of social solidarity. Across nations, too, we must initiate and build a fresh compact of enduring solidarity, as we in our Caribbean Community (CARICOM), have done with much success, despite a limitation of resources. Our United Nations, and its specialised agencies, are the locales for the construction of an ambitious, renewed global compact, not of world government, but of a genguine community of nations through a bona fide multilateralism, grounded in international law. This is not merely a technical exercise but a profoundly political one of the first order in which this revitalised compact is efficaciously fashioned on the fertilised soil of genuine commitment among all nations. Let us thus lift Lift Humanity Higher!\nIn this regard, powerful states must roll back their unilateralist, unwholesome and prejudicial, constraints on weaker nations. The list is long and includes: unilateralist sanctions; weaponising of the trade, banking and financial system; the misuse and abuse of so-called \u201cblacklists\u201d by developed countries against developing ones; the unilateralist termination of correspondent banking relations on purely spurious, and hypocritical, grounds; the breaking of international law, willy-nilly, to serve narrowly nationalist interests on this or that issue, including the existential matter of climate change; and the relegation of Small Island Developing States to the expendable margins of the global political economy.\nMr. President,\nAs a small island developing state faced with an exceptional and unique admixture of existential circumstances, ranging from our inherent vulnerabilities as a small open economy with porous borders, to the legacies of underdevelopment left in the wake of European settler colonialism, native genocide, the enslavement of Africans, and the indentureship of Madeirans and Indians, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has made tremendous strides to advance meaningfully a progressive and people-centred development agenda. Yet, despite our best efforts, the disastrous economic implications of a global COVID-19 recession threatens to stymie our advances.\nThese detrimental impacts, already disproportionately felt across the Global South, stem from sharp declines in remittances; significant disruptions of trade, travel and other economic activity; and the negative effects on social welfare, as limited resources are diverted to save lives. For small island developing states, without predictable and reliable financing through concessional loans, without scaled up development assistance, and flexible and innovative forms of debt-relief, we risk falling further behind \u2014 unable to safeguard our human development agenda or provide necessary social protections to many of our people. To avert these grim prospects, ambitious reform of the international financial architecture that takes into account our Small Island States\u2019 Exceptionalism is urgently needed.\nMr. President,\nThe continued use of the illegal and inhumane economic embargo on the Republic of Cuba, and the unilateral economic sanctions imposed for the purpose of stoking social unrest as part of an externally-driven \u201cregime change\u201d agenda in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela are but two egregious examples of how the norms and principles of international law are desecrated for sake of power and self-interest. Despite their own serious challenges, the governments and peoples of Cuba and Venezuela continue to stand as models for camaraderie and solidarity, dispatching medical brigades and essential supplies in response to COVID-19.\nSuch is the absurd contradiction that those who employ the human rights mantra as a guise for unilateral action would wilfully deprive millions of people, living in countries near and far, of their right to dignity and development by deploying the most debilitating foreign policy tools. The immense suffering of the people of Syria, as a result of a conflict that they did not choose, and geopolitical forces over which they exert no influence, stands as a prime example of the paradox of humanitarian intervention. In similar fashion, the convergence of a parallelogram of contradictory forces in Yemen has precipitated a humanitarian crisis of monumental proportions. Syria and Yemen are arguably two of the biggest catastrophes in the world which require constructive forms of multilateral engagement that yield people-centred solutions with full respect for international law. I feel sure that interested regional powers yearn for peace and stability in Yemen and Syria.\nMr. President,\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines reaffirms its solidarity with the Palestinian people whose daily existence remain marred by the persistent threat of illegal annexation. Honouring the Palestinian peoples\u2019 long held quest for self-determination and statehood by revisiting the question of full membership at the United Nations is a matter that is long overdue, and an essential component of a lasting Two-State Solution in the quest for a sustainable peace in the Middle East. In a similar vein, the constructive and pragmatic intergovernmental engagement of Taiwan, as a responsible advocate for sustainable development and an exemplar of the magnificent Chinese Civilization, validates the case for Taiwan\u2019s meaningful participation in the specialised agencies and bodies of the United Nations.\nMr. President,\nThe complex challenges of the 21st Century will not be solved by military means or by a quest for hegemony. While those who sell weapons have been traditionally positioned to broker peace, we cannot expect to use outdated tools to address effectively contemporary exingencies. Accordingly, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines reiterates the importance of addressing earnestly the question of Security Council reform \u2014 by, among other things, expanding the permanent membership to include our brothers and sisters from the African continent, by incorporating the nuanced perspectives of small island states as a continuously rotating fixture, and by upgrading the working methods of this august, but historically-shackled, body to reflect the realities of the modern world. This issue continues to occupy the attention of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines at the Security Council where my country has forged a strong partnership with the three non-permanent members from Africa, in what has become known as the A3+1.\nMr. President,\nAmidst the thundering calls for racial and social justice, globally, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines affirms, yet again, that Black Lives Matter. During this International Decade for People of African Descent, the case for reparatory justice remains unanswerably strong. The legacies of underdevelopment arising from the genocide of our native Kalinago and Garifuna people, and the enslavement of African bodies prompt our just and legitimate demand for appropriate recompense, grounded in historical fact, contemporary reality, and international law, from European Nations and their successor Nation States in North America. The international campaign for reparatory justice, widely promoted by governments across our Caribbean Community and by social activists within the industrialized metropoles, must form part of any serious efforts to achieve the sustainable development agenda.\nMr. President,\nAs I conclude, I reiterate that, the complex, consequential and overlapping challenges facing our world today can only be resolved through inclusive multilateral solutions and comprehensive development strategies. Admittedly, in any collective struggle for peace or prosperity there are no easy victories. Yet, it is in our darkest moments, when these struggles seem insurmountable, that we must work together in unity and in solidarity, not in spite of, but precisely because, our distinct perspectives and interests necessitate that \u201cwe the peoples\u201d work together. As we embark on a new decade of our collective journey, let us craft a more just and equitable world in which all nations and peoples participate meaningfully a measured apportionment of both burden and benefit.\nI Thank You."

Zimbabwe is confident that under your able stewardship, the General Assembly will proficiently address the challenges that are presently facing our organization and our world.\nI also wish to convey our sincere gratitude to the President of the 74th Session of the Assembly, Professor Tijjani Muhamad-Bande, for skillfully executing his responsibilities during his tenure.\nThis year we celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of our United Nations organization. It is gratifying that we continue to make a qualitative difference in the lives of many people throughout the world. Our jubilation has sadly been marred by the COVID 19 pandemic which has brought to the fore the importance of unity and effective multilateral cooperation in building a future we want.\nThe theme of this 75th Session, \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitments to multilateralism-confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action\u201d, is therefore apt and most appropriate.\nToday humanity is at a crossroads as we are confronted by complex challenges that do not respect any borders.\nMultilateralism is under increasing threat from the blind pursuit of narrow interests. We must therefore strengthen international amity and goodwill as well as uphold mutual respect and observe the sovereign equality of States.\nYour Excellencies,\nZimbabwe is on a new path. Like other nations in the region, we are facing humanitarian challenges which in our case have been worsened by the illegal sanctions, the negative impact of climate change, and compounded by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHowever, my administration continues to record notable achievements towards sustainable development which leaves no one behind. Our macro- economic stabilization reforms have seen the reduction of our budget deficit to a single digit, as well as a positive balance of our current account, coupled with foreign exchange rate and prices stability.\nMajor infrastructure projects are ongoing, such as the rehabilitation and construction of health service facilities, water and sanitation infrastructure as well as roads, dams and bridges across the country. Investments in mining, agriculture, tourism, energy and manufacturing sectors are on the increase.\nWe are optimistic that the implementation of the second phase of Ease of Doing Business Reforms will help to further improve our World Bank rankings.\nSimilarly, my Administration is decisive in entrenching Constitutionalism, democracy and the rule of law, including the protection of property rights. The commitment of my Government to these cardinal principles remains unwavering. It is in this spirit and in line with our Constitution that in July this year, my Government concluded the landmark Global Compensation Deed, with former farm owners. We count on the support and goodwill of the international community as we mobilize resources to implement the Agreement.\nThe alignment of our laws to the Constitution is almost complete, while new pieces of legislation continue to be enacted to strengthen our institutions. The raft of political reforms will benefit the generality of Zimbabweans as we consolidate our respect of human rights.\nMy administration places great importance on fostering national unity and cohesion. The culture of dialogue across all sectors is taking root, with activities and programmes under the auspices of our homegrown Political Actors Dialogue (POLAD), gaining momentum.\nRecently, the UN Secretary General; the High Commissioner for Human Rights; and the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, all acknowledged the deleterious effects of the illegal economic sanctions on our country. These are a breach of international law and compromise Zimbabwe\u2019s capacity to implement and achieve Sustainable Development especially SDGs 2, 3, 8, 9 and 17. We, therefore, call on the General Assembly to strongly pronounce itself against these Unilateral illegal sanctions.\nYour Excellencies,\nLet me assure you that Zimbabwe continues to implement measures to battle the COVID-19 pandemic. Over and above instituting phased lockdowns, following the World Health Organization guidelines, my Government has also provided ZWL$18 billion (approximately US$720 million) economic stimulus package.\nZimbabwe welcomes calls by the UN Secretary General and the Director General of the WHO, Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus, for the COVID-19 vaccine to be treated as a global public good with guaranteed fair distribution and mechanisms to ensure equal access.\nWe are encouraged by the ongoing cooperation between the UN Secretary General, the G20 and the Bretton Woods institutions towards finding solutions to developing countrys\u2019 debt and related issues. While the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have supported a debt standstill up to the end of the year, more needs to be done.\nAs a committed partner in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Zimbabwe welcomed the launch of the Decade of Action. In this spirit, we hosted the 6th Africa Regional Forum for Sustainable Development in Victoria Falls in February 2020, which adopted the Victoria Falls Declaration on the Decade of Action for Sustainable Development in Africa.\nAs we move forward, we believe that strengthening public health systems, international solidarity and partnerships are critical.\nYour Excellencies,\nAs we celebrate the 25th Anniversary of the 4th World Conference on Women on 1 st October this year, I am gratified to highlight that Zimbabwe has taken major steps in implementing the Beijing Declaration. These include the adoption of a gender responsive Constitution, establishment of the Zimbabwe Gender Commission, enactment of several pieces of legislation to outlaw all practices that infringe on the rights of women and girls such as forced and child marriages and discrimination against women in inheritance matters. My Government has also set up a Women\u2019s Bank to facilitate access to finance by women-owned businesses and projects.\nYour Excellencies,\nIt is now more than 15 years since the adoption of the Ezulwini Consensus, reaffirmed in the Sirte Declaration. It is deeply regrettable that reform of the Security Council and implementation of Africa\u2019s position has not been achieved. We cannot continue with a situation where over 16 per cent of the world\u2019s population does not have a voice in decision making. This is a serious indictment to our avowed commitment to multilateralism and the basic principles of natural justice, fairness and equity.\nPeace, security and stability are a pre-requisite for sustainable development. This can only be achieved in an inclusive process characterized by equally shared commitment and responsibilities. We count on the international community to strengthen its support for AU-led peace efforts. We also look forward to greater collaboration between the AU and the UN in maintaining sustainable international peace and security in accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations, more particularly in ensuring the effective implementation of the AU\u2019s campaign on \u201cSilencing the Guns\u201d.\nSelf-determination and independence are intrinsic and fundamental rights that should be enjoyed by all without distinction. We call on the Security Council to increase its efforts towards ending the occupation of Western Sahara.\nZimbabwe also calls upon the Secretary-General to appoint his Personal Envoy for Western Sahara without further delay.\nMr. President,\nExcellencies,\nLadies and Gentlemen.\nLet me conclude by reaffirming Zimbabwe\u2019s commitment to work for a better world. There is no better way of achieving a peaceful andstable world than through mutual respect, genuine multilateralism buttressed by much needed reforms and respect for international law. Recommitting ourselves to these ideals will pave way for the just world that we all yearn for.\nI thank you."

        "file_text": "His Excellency the President of the General Assembly,\nHis Excellency the Secretary-General,\nMajesties, Highnesses and Excellencies,\nDistinguished Representatives of countries and institutions in your ranks and qualities,\nAs-salamu alaykum\nLet me, Mr. President, warmly congratulate you on your brilliant election as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fifth session and assure you of the complete readiness of the Comorian Government to work for the success of your presidency.\nAt the same time, I congratulate your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, for the efficiency with which he led the work of the previous session and for having honoured Africa and his country, the Federal Republic of Nigeria, in carrying out his mandate.\nI pay well-deserved tribute to His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, Secretary- General of the United Nations (UN), for his commitment to serving the Organization, the responsibilities and challenges of which are becoming increasingly numerous and complex.\nMajesties, Highnesses, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nThis session, which coincides with the seventy-fifth anniversary of the founding of the UN, is taking place in the context of a serious global health crisis as a result ofCOVID-19.\nIt has required the international community to take resolute action to address it.\nIt has awakened the collective consciousness, which, in this difficult situation, has transcended the separation of continents, inspired unprecedented international solidarity and united the world around the same goal to contain and defeat COVID-19.\nI would like to take this opportunity to convey the most painfully heartfelt condolences of the Comorian people and Government to the countries of the world, in particular to all those who, in the Comoros like everywhere else in the world, have lost relatives, friends, brothers and sisters.\nThe virulence that COVID-19 has raged and continues to rage upon populations has left them helpless. Of course, no country has surrendered, but we have had to rely on world solidarity, as that is our only salvation!\nLet me, therefore, sincerely thank our brotherly and friendly countries, the various institutions, the non-governmental organizations, the agencies and the people of good will who have realized that need and demonstrated their solidarity with our country. The unfaltering action taken by countries and institutions has benefited and enabled the Union of the Comoros to deal with the pandemic.\nSince the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in the sisterly island of Mayotte on 14 March 14, we have taken the measures needed to effectively respond to the disease, in particular through establishing coordination among the various national and island structures, with a view to effectively manage and monitor the pandemic.\nA weekly interministerial council has been set up to monitor and give the needed guidance to these different structures.\nMany social-distancing measures were also taken with the support of law enforcement agencies to prevent the potential spread of the disease, in addition to closing borders and banning all gatherings.\nFinally, in the economic, financial and banking areas, other measures were taken to support economic drivers and avoid any disruption in the delivery of fuel or shortages of basic needs.\nThat is how we have succeeded in controlling the COVID-19 situation in our country, while we must continue to be vigilant.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to appeal for international solidarity and, above all, acknowledging the work of everyone involved in the daily and extremely difficult battle, which we must all wage against the invisible enemy.\nI find it truly regrettable that some countries are claiming the right to place others on the list of red zones affected by COVID-19, while disregarding actual data publicly in national bulletins and reports.\nAt this extremely sensitive time, it would be wiser to exclusively delegate the weighty task of classifying countries to the parent organization of the WHO, based on the updated and verified data available to it.\nI also commend the actions taken by the entire Comorian medical corps, political and religious leaders, local leaders, the private sector, all social actors and especially the women\u2019s and youth organizations, which continue to demonstrate to us that they are a great source of strength on which the country can depend to deal with any situation.\nMoreover, in its capacity as the Chair of the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC), the Union of the Comoros is closely following the pandemic situation in the Indian Ocean region.\nAccordingly, a teleconference connecting the Ministers of Health of the countries of the region was set up to share information concerning the pandemic situation in the region and the measures to be taken together to better safeguard their populations and effectively manage the pandemic.\nMajesties, Highnesses, Excellencies, Honourable Audience,\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has entered our discussions at the national, regional, and even family levels, whereby nothing can be projected without considering this new reality beforehand.\nConcurrently, however, at the global and individual country levels, our collective commitments to peace, development and the protection of our environment constitute even more acute challenges that we must take up together to create the conditions necessary for a peaceful and decent life for the citizens of the world.\nTherefore, although our organization, the UN, is going through this health crisis, other crises call for considerable efforts on our part.\nThat is why the debate on the reform of its main organs to reflect the reality of today\u2019s world and better respond to the issues at stake will always remain topical and part of every one of our meetings.\nIn that regard, let me warmly congratulate the new non-permanent Member States elected to the Security Council.\nI hope that the representation of the world\u2019s continents within the Council will be effective, so that they can see themselves represented within the Organization, which must guarantee perfect inclusion.\nThe UN must also be able to continue its fight against exclusion and contribute to prioritizing respect for human rights.\nIn the Union of the Comoros, major efforts are being made to that end.\nSubsequent to our accession to the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, the most recent measure taken in that regard was the establishment of the High Council of Magistracy.\nThat represents a decisive step towards realizing the goals that I set for myself \u2014 making the Comorian justice system a framework that protects the weakest individuals while safeguarding them from being arbitrarily treated.\nThe continued violation of the inalienable rights of certain people in the world today is quite simply a disgrace in the twenty-first century.\nThe brotherly Palestinian people are an example of the latter, perfectly illustrating what oppression a people can experience. The Palestinian people have the right to live peacefully in their territory and to enjoy all their rights, just like all other citizens of the world.\nThe Union of the Comoros therefore continues to believe that a viable and just solution must be found, which will lead to the establishment of a Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living side by side in peace with the State of Israel.\nI commend what the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, responsibly said in opposing any plan seeking to annex the Palestinian territories.\nThe situation of oppression in the world cannot be ignored.\nRights, and particularly the right to worship, are enshrined in international instruments that are binding on our States and that must be applied at the national level. The role of the UN is crucial. The principles and values it stands for are today at the centre of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which every country has adopted as its own.\nFor its part, the Union of the Comoros, like several other countries, presented, via a video-conference organized under the auspices of the United Nations, a report on its implementation of the SDGs, which accounted for the work accomplished in that area so as to be part of the global dynamic to ensure a better future for humankind.\nIn that regard, the Government is working closely with the United Nations system in Moroni and all the relevant actors to implement the SDGs, and I commend the impeccable collaboration of those agencies with my Government.\nHonourable Audience, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nAs everyone knows, my country held the Development Partners Conference for Comoros in Paris in 2019 to create the conditions necessary for it to meet the ambitious commitment to achieve the status of emerging-market country by 2030. The Conference was attended by hundreds of bilateral and multilateral partners and members the private sector, and the pledges made there are reflective of its success.\nI thank France once again for agreeing to sponsor that important event.\nI also reiterate my thanks to the World Bank for having agreed to host the Conference at its Paris headquarters.\nFinally, I once again thank all those who, in an exemplary spirit of solidarity, accepted our invitation to attend.\nAt the end of the Conference, we raised a significant amount of money in overall pledges, which fills us with pride, as the sum largely exceeded our expectations.\nIn April, I established an executive secretariat to follow up on the commitments made at the Conference and to allocate the necessary resources to make the Comoros into an emerging-market country.\nI therefore solemnly call on our partners to honour those commitments so that we can establish the work timetables that will enable us to move forward with the work and communication tools available to us, as we await the return to a normal state to follow up.\nMoreover, I underscore that the health crisis facing the whole world has not led us to forget our important and crucial issues, especially those related to our national sovereignty.\nAccordingly, Mayotte will always remain at the forefront of our foreign policy and our demands. It is a struggle that has been legitimized by the Assembly, with which every person worthy of being called a Comorian should identify.\nIn that regard, let me recall that in July 2019, President Emmanuel Macron and I met in Paris, and our respective Ministers for Foreign Affairs signed a document enshrining the common will of both parties to move forward in the search for a just and viable solution to the thorny problem of the Comorian island of Mayotte, with a shared concern to preserve the interests of both sides.\nI am counting, then, on the goodwill of the French and Comorian authorities, who must understand that it is time to find a solution to the unpleasant dispute, in the words of the late President Mitterrand, as the ties and interests that unite us make it incumbent upon us to preserve the best interests of our two peoples and of present and future Comorian, French and Franco-Comorian generations\nMajesties, Highnesses, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nI sincerely hope that the whole world will overcome the terrible coronavirus pandemic so that we will all be able to resume our daily lives and so that the UN, our prestigious institution, which brings us together around noble values and principles, will also be able to survive myriad vicissitudes in order to pursue its mission \u2014 a role that no other institution in history has ever had to play.\nI thank you for your kind attention!"

        "file_text": "Your Excellency Volkan Bozkir, President of the General Assembly Your Excellency Antonio Guterres, Secretary General of the United Nations Excellencies, Colleagues, Ministers and Permanent Representatives, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nIntroduction\nMr. President,\nWe are indeed at an unprecedented time during the historic anniversary for this global body of Nations. It would have been an honour for me to personally deliver my maiden address at the rostrum of the General Assembly. The onset and continued prevalence of COVID-19 has prevented this. Thankfully we can make optimal use of modern technology.\nAs President of the 75th session of the General Assembly you will undoubtedly face challenges in the conduct of international relations and conference diplomacy. Please allow me to pledge our full support in the successful discharge of your duties.\nWe salute your predecessor, Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, for his skillful leadership of the previous session and wish him well in his future endeavors.\nTo Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, we wish to pay tribute for his sterling efforts in guiding this organization.\nMr. President,\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is, apart from the human toll, turning food supply chains upside down, paralysing economies and eroding consumer purchasing power.\nAnd the United Nations World Economic Situation and Prospects (WESP) mid 2020 report, has confirmed what we as leaders and communities have experienced, that the pandemic has unleashed a health and economic crisis unprecedented in scope and magnitude.\nThis compels us as an international community to embrace multilateralism as an effective way to win this battle and our best defense against future global threats, and to continue seeking effective means to support small and vulnerable nations.\nThe theme of this years\u2019 session of the General Debate is therefore opportune.\nMr. President,\nThe United Nations remains the premier international multilateral organization and should exert its eminent role and place in the development and furthering of the principles pertaining to international relations, international law, international peace and \u2014 development.\nAt the same time, the UN has been instrumental in bringing the world together to defend human rights, democracy and democratic institutions, uphold the rule of law, and good governance, sustain peace and security and advance the path towards realizing the 17 sustainable development goals.\nDespite considerable progress made in global discussions on a variety of matters \u2014 from climate change, sustainable development, migration, refugees, terrorism, cyber-warfare to nuclear proliferation \u2014 we have experienced that multilateralism has occasionally come under attack.\nSince the founding of the United Nations 75 years ago, the geopolitical field has changed drastically. The Security Council membership and its working methods need a structured evaluation.\nCan you imagine that we have been elaborating for more than two (2) decades about reform of this main Organ!\nIt is therefore fitting to ask ourselves if this organ is still relevant in its current form. Does it answer to the questions of today\u2019s challenges and aspirations?\nI hope, Mr. President, that we don\u2019t have to ask ourselves this question again in 75 years!\nIt is therefore of utmost importance that multilateralism adapts to these changing times.\nI call on the international community of nations to embark on a strategic assessment of the existing multilateral framework.\nLet us, based on the current realities, and challenges, dare to create a new multilateralism that fundamentally focuses on peace and prosperity of all nations and allows for the increased efficiency in the supporting institutional framework.\nA multilateralism, that acknowledges all nations, irrespective of their size and development level and place in the global order, as equal and with respect.\nA multilateralism where compliance by every state with international law and internationally accepted principles forms the bedrock of our interactions;\nA multilateralism, based on international cooperation to confront the many global challenges and seizing the common opportunities, that promotes a culture of inclusiveness and equality.\nUnilateral actions have always proven counterproductive and will never lead to achieve any defined objective. Nevertheless, dialogue and the active involvement of all countries, taking into account international principles, is what we should strive for.\nMore importantly, Mr. President, a multilateralism that necessitates us to recommit to the vision of the UN Charter.\nIn this regard, we call for the lifting of the longstanding unilateral economic, financial and commercial embargo against the Republic of Cuba and its people.\nMultilateralism for climate change\nMr. President,\nWhile the focus of the international community is currently on managing and containing the further spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, we should continue to dedicate our attention to other challenges of equal or even greater impact on the sustainable development of countries and the entire planet.\nAddressing the impact of climate change is one of these challenges.\nAs a country with 239 miles of a low-lying coastline, Suriname is among the top 10 of most vulnerable countries with respect to the disastrous effects of sea-level rise as a result of global warming.\nDespite this position, Suriname has taken the lead as the country with the highest forest cover and low deforestation rate, to advocate for the mobilization of financial resources in support of our sustainable development, while making a significant contribution to mitigating global warming.\nIt is estimated that our standing forests store 12 gigatons of forest carbon per year. Not a small contribution at all, I believe!\nHowever, these national commitments may only serve particular domestic concerns, but to maximize their impact strong international engagement is necessary with ambitious and attainable targets.\nSuriname will focus strongly on generating investment and business opportunities. It is mainly for this reason that my Administration will develop and act on the widest implementation of SDG Number 17, by the promotion and facilitation of clean and corruption free Public Private Partnerships (PPP).\nReform of the international system\nMr. President,\nIn the past years we have realized reforms of the United Nations system, but much remains to be done.\nParticipation of developing countries, especially the small economies, in the global financial and trading system is one of the long overdue reforms that has to take place.\nI believe that global strategic collaboration and complimentary financial \u2014 economic approaches are required. This can be achieved through closer partnerships between the IMF, World Bank and the WTO.\nThe way forward\nMr. President,\nDeveloping countries and nations in the South should not be passive in their quest for development.\nConsequently, South-South cooperation, not to the exclusion of North-South relations, should be further explored and expanded in articulating and promoting the collective economic and business interests.\nThis is in essence what our people elect us for. This is what the international community expects of its leaders, to be examples of inspiring leadership and vanguards of hope for our common humanity.\nIt is the same hope that allows us to break down walls of mistrust, which may take the form of intolerance, fear, or violence. It is the same hope that leads us to strive for peace and prosperity as our predecessors did.\nIt is particularly this hope that will give the upcoming generation of leaders the strength to elevate this global Assembly of World Leaders to a place where, collectively, the nations of the world should find ways to make a better life possible for all of the global community, for the next 75 years.\nI congratulate all of us with reaching this milestone anniversary. Let us all in unity, respect and solidarity strive to make the next 75 years even better and save for our future.\nI thank you."

        "file_text": "President of the General Assembly, Ambassador Volkan Bozkir,\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres,\nHeads of State and Government,\nNational representatives and representatives of international organizations,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nThe seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations finds us once again amid a crisis, which, undoubtedly, looks very different to the disaster caused by the Second World War, but also forces us to reimagine our future in order to build on achievements and prevent future crises, be they economic, health, climate or all of them together.\nThe scale of the current pandemic and its distressing consequences \u2014 loss of life and its impact on the health of many people \u2014 are the focus of our attention because we must seek solutions for our peoples, in particular those who are most vulnerable and most at risk of being affected by the pandemic as a result of its impact on their health, as well as on their way and means of life.\nBut the commemoration of this anniversary should also challenge us about the future we want for our countries and societies beyond this crisis.\nIt is here before the General Assembly, Mr. President, that Uruguay wishes to emphasize once again that the road to be travelled, both for a way out of the pandemic and for the next 75 years, will always find us on the same side \u2014 that of multilateralism \u2014 supporting the quest for solutions that are protected by multilateral legal frameworks in all aspects of international life \u2014 health, environment, trade and migration.\nUruguay\u2019s accession to membership a few months ago in the Alliance for Multilateralism, an initiative, launched by Germany and France, seeking to uphold multilateral order, is another sign of our country\u2019s commitment to this cause.\nMr. President,\nUruguay supports the role of the World Health Organization and the role of the United Nations system in coordinating the global response to the pandemic, as we understand that international organizations play a fundamental role in coordinating and guiding the best possible solutions to the current critical situation and in the coordinated management of its medium- and long-term impacts.\nMy country, Mr. President, has adhered to the calls to achieve global and equitable access to health technologies, medicines and vaccines through the sharing of knowledge, intellectual property and data necessary for the detection, prevention, treatment and response to COVID-19.\nOur country\u2019s response to the pandemic has focused on a multidisciplinary approach that covers its social, economic and epidemiological aspects and is monitored by an Honorary Scientific Advisory Group of which we are very proud. Our approach is based on our citizens\u2019 responsible use of their freedom, with solidarity and generosity, which, together with a strong and resilient health system, has allowed us to resume work and educational and cultural activities.\nWe would also like to call on the international community to ensure that the current pandemic does not result in our failing to fully honour the commitments made at the multilateral level. We must avoid falling prey to nationalism and protectionism, which would in any way harm international relations in international trade or disrupt supply chains and the distribution of the medical supplies that are so necessary for emerging from this health crisis.\nAt the beginning of the Decade of Action to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals, moving from words to action will be essential for ending poverty, protecting the environment and improving the living conditions of the world\u2019s population.\nThe United Nations has promoted Agenda 2030 and, despite the considerable current challenges, it should remain the main guide to achieving sustainable development.\nUruguay has worked hard since its recognition for effective compliance. Our country continues to honour its history of reducing inequalities, as well as its commitment to decent work based on investment and growth.\nOur Government has also made the necessary commitment to education at all levels, as education is essential for the full actualization of human beings and for ensuring that all citizens have equal opportunities.\nThis global pandemic has shown that in the face of ever-changing challenges, it is important to maintain the necessary environment and support for international cooperation, so that all States, and in particular developing countries, can move towards sustainable development.\nIn this scenario, it is paradoxical that countries classified as high-income developing countries, such as Uruguay, do not have access to the majority of sources of international cooperation or more favourable lines of credit. That is why we will continue to promote the revision of that classification or graduation, which is based solely on per capita income.\nFor these categories to be truly adequate and equitable, a multidimensional criterion should be considered to define classifications of development and the international support needs of each country based on its specific situation.\nIn this regard, I wish to underscore the support of ECLAC for the development of a multi-factor approach. Sustainable development will not be such if we are not concerned about caring for the environment. That, too, as with the pandemic, is a challenge that countries cannot face alone, but requires collective will to meet the challenges facing humankind.\nUruguay continues to take steps in this direction with its recently established Ministry of Environment to demonstrate that this issue is a priority for the Government.\nMr. President, Uruguay wishes to reiterate its support for the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and its firm commitment to objectives in that area.\nUruguay has developed a National Climate Change Response Plan, which addresses risk prevention, mitigation and adaptation.\nWe understand that productive efforts, good experiences and effective and efficient management, subject to accountability in the light of current challenges, should receive greater attention and recognition.\nWe also welcome the holding of the Summit on Biodiversity, which will take place next week. We express our commitment to promoting strategies and practices for the sustainable use of biological diversity and natural resources, while developing mechanisms to improve their management and use.\nMy country would like to reaffirm here at the Assembly its support for the Secretary-General\u2019s Road Map for Digital Cooperation. Uruguay understands that for these initiatives to prosper and contribute effectively to the fulfilment of the SDGs, digital technologies must enable us to bridge the digital and connectivity divide, among countries and within each country alike.\nIt is also essential to promote respect for human rights in such networks, the protection of privacy and personal data, as well as access to information and freedom of expression, both public and private.\nLastly, it is necessary to work on digital security, with the broad participation of State actors, the private sector and civil society.\nWith regard to the Secretary-General\u2019s initiatives, I would like to focus for a moment on his call for a ceasefire \u2014 a global ceasefire \u2014 which was endorsed by my country.\nA peaceful environment is indispensable for addressing the pandemic, which is why we must now recommit to dialogue, peaceful dispute resolution and the rule of law in order to alleviate suffering and bring hope to the most vulnerable populations.\nMy country is strongly committed to United Nations peacekeeping forces, as it is a main contributor of troops per capita worldwide. A clear demonstration of this national commitment is the offer made by our Government to establish a laboratory to increase medical diagnostic capabilities within United Nations peace operations in response to the pandemic.\nIn this context, it is worth recalling Uruguay\u2019s calls to protect hospitals and schools under attack in conflict zones and the need to support Security Council resolutions on this matter.\nUruguay reiterates its national commitment to the human rights agenda and will continue to actively uphold human rights, including the protection and rights of children, the plight of civilians in conflict situations and women\u2019s rights, and promote respect for such rights among actors in the international community. In this regard, we will continue to ensure the effective implementation of advocacy mechanisms by the United Nations.\nWe would like to make special mention of the vulnerable sections of the population, who are particularly affected by the pandemic, such as women who are victims of domestic violence, which is of particular concern for Uruguay. It has prompted us to develop specific policies to respond to this situation. We cannot forget migrants and internally displaced persons, who are also doubly vulnerable to this pandemic.\nWe again underscore the open policy of our country, which welcomes voluntary migration, based on the values of democracy and equality before the law and respect for the rights of all people, regardless of their origin.\nMr. President, by strengthening human rights, not only will protection be advanced, but those called to be key actors in building peace and promoting development will be empowered, more specifically women and young people.\nLastly, I would like to underscore the role of the International Criminal Court and the importance of its deterrent effect on mass genocides and atrocities and their perpetrators. Uruguay reiterates its commitment to the international justice system and, in particular, its support for the International Criminal Court as an independent and impartial judicial institution with a central role in the fight against impunity and in the pursuit of justice.\nIn this forum, where peace was sealed 75 years ago, I would like to express my concern about the threats posed by non-compliance with or the withdrawal of some parties from disarmament agreements, which may lead to the resumption of an arms race that will take us back to a time when the world lived in the spectre a possible nuclear conflict. Global peace cannot be achieved without serious commitments by the international community on disarmament and non-proliferation.\nThe region and my country are concerned about the proliferation and illicit trafficking of small arms and light weapons, which pose a threat to the stability of regions and global security, incite crime and insecurity and affect peaceful coexistence in society.\nOur Government is committed to combating insecurity and crime and we will work hard to do so. We will also continue to cooperate with the United Nations in the fight against terrorism, transnational organized crime and the links between the two.\nMr. President, the future we want for our peoples is one in which we can move ahead with common and supportive solutions to challenges that emerge, in order to achieve sustainable and inclusive development, where the rights of all are respected and opportunities are offered for the development of each and every citizen of this world, leaving no one behind.\nWe want a peaceful future in a world where States are committed to dialogue and negotiation; where we find a way to emerge from today\u2019s conflicts that considers the rights of all parties. We therefore need to redouble our commitment to preventive diplomacy and mediation, as well as to conflict prevention. To this end, we need a United Nations that focuses more on coordination, both in word and in deed. We need an Organization that actively cooperates with other international organizations, including financial institutions, to implement a variety of mechanisms that enable countries to overcome external and internal obstacles to development, given its multidimensional nature.\nUruguay is particularly interested in increasing the relevance of the overall efforts of the United Nations, and in particular the General Assembly, as well as its Member States to ensure the potential for effective participation.\nUruguay has always sought to contribute to the overall transparency of the functioning of the United Nations and all its organs, including the work of the United Nations Security Council.\nIn today\u2019s world, the possibility for increasing the efficiency and efficiency of the Organization will be appreciated, while cutting operating costs and increasing transparency and accountability with regard to its spending.\nWe particularly appreciate the Organization\u2019s efforts to include civil society and the private sector, as part of the solution to the economic, social and environmental issues that arise, as inclusive and sustainable development requires the participation of the entire society.\nThe leaders of the world must rise to the level of the circumstances and of our peoples and be capable, just as our leaders were 75 years ago, of thinking beyond the current crisis and consolidating the multilateral mechanisms and instruments that enable our societies to achieve sustainable and inclusive development, respecting democracy, freedoms and the rights of all human beings.\nWe world leaders must take charge.\nThank you very much."

        "file_text": "His Excellency Mr. Volkan Bozkir, President of the seventy-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly\nHis Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations\nHeads of State and Government\nDistinguished delegates,\nHistory has taught us that decisions made in times of crisis define and leave their mark on the world for decades.\nIn other words, the great trials of humankind, such as pandemics, have forced us to break with the past, to imagine a new world.\nThis pandemic is no different. It is a portal \u2014 the bridge between one world and the next.\nWorld leaders today face a number of extraordinary and monumental challenges.\nIn the short, medium and long term, COVID-19 has put the paradigms of today\u2019s society to the test and challenges us to actively build the future we want.\nThis implies changes in our economic systems, leadership and governance, transparency, protection and restoration of biodiversity, human rights and social inclusion.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nCOVID-19 has highlighted contradictions in public policy, throughout the world, and reveals that a post-pandemic world must be sustainable and better.\nThe decisions we make today will have long-term consequences. Doing more of the same is simply unsustainable. That would mean disregarding the scale of human suffering that the pandemic has unleashed.\nThis crisis is unnerving \u2014 in part because it has new and unfamiliar characteristics. It is a global health emergency.\nHowever, the most worrisome part of the pandemic is not new. COVID-19 has highlighted deep inequalities that already exist.\nAlthough the pandemic affects us all, not all of us are affected equally. We must all focus on poverty and inequality.\nIf in the past some chose to ignore them, it is now impossible not to acknowledge their harsh reality.\nLet us be clear. The post-pandemic world will continue with the same problems we face now, but under increasingly extreme conditions.\nThe post-pandemic world will be different only if, going forward, even amid this battle, we take mitigation measures and focus on laying the foundations to resolve these issues and bring about deep structural change.\nIf we learn the right lessons from this crisis, we will be able to achieve the social consensus that will allow us to accelerate the reforms needed to achieve a society that is prosperous, and above all, just and more united.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nOne of the main lessons learned from the pandemic is the importance of trusting science, technology and innovation to provide solutions that allow us to close existing social gaps.\nThe circumstances created by the pandemic enabled the rapid implementation of innovative systems. Learning processes have been accelerated as never before, leading to greater return on the State\u2019s investment in innovation.\nThis is particularly true in the digital economy, reflected in the shift to methods, such as telecommuting or the consumption of services and products ordered and delivered online and by courier.\nIt is also seen in the application of first-world digital educational platforms, which we now use in some of our public schools or in the practice of telemedicine, which allows citizens in remote areas to receive medical care from specialists hundreds of kilometres away.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nAn increase in unemployment is a serious consequence of the health crisis. Here, too, there is an important opportunity for our economies, which are based primarily on informal work, as the groundwork is laid and the necessary changes are made in public policies to build the future we want \u2014 one focused on entrepreneurship and the formalization of employment.\nIn a post-COVID-19 world, shared prosperity can be the result of a common vision of global solidarity.\nThe most important lesson from the pandemic is that of working together on problems that affect humankind. Without a doubt, we are stronger together than apart.\nLet us remember that after the Second World War, it was the need to survive, rebuild economies and prevent the scourge of a new war that brought countries together to create a new international order.\nThe pandemic has again produced that de facto solidarity. We have seen how international cooperation has been mobilized through concrete actions by countries. For example, scientists from Asia, Europe and the Americas share information and experiences.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nAs the country with the best maritime and air connectivity in Latin America and the Caribbean, Panama has done the same in its position as hub of the Americas, by allowing its infrastructure to be used by the world \u2014 maintaining the 144 maritime routes and 1,700 ports served by its Canal. We have kept our port and airport open, thereby ensuring the continuity of logistics chains for global supplies, in particular of food and medicine.\nWe demonstrated our solidarity by providing humanitarian assistance and allowing the Zandaam and Rotterdam cruise ships, which were affected by COVID-19, to transit the Panama Canal so that their passengers could be treated in time, thereby preventing a greater tragedy.\nWe allowed our infrastructure to be used by the region, thereby making it possible for humanitarian assistance in the form of supplies, medicines and medical equipment to be distributed to more than 30 countries through the Regional Logistics Center, the United Nations World Food Programme and the International Red Cross.\nOnly together, with solidarity and cooperation, can we move forward.\nIf the international community fails to respond now, in a decisive manner, the United Nations 2030 Agenda could be derailed.\nA new multilateral order requires genuine commitment from each of our countries to taking concrete action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. And what is agreed here in this forum is delivered upon at home.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nOur planet has been extremely badly hurt.\nThe pandemic has plunged millions of people into grief. We are engaged in a relentless daily battle, facing the unseen and the uncertain, head-on, refusing to surrender.\nWe have lost grandparents, parents and children in the deadly duel against the virus. Nurses, doctors, health workers have fallen victim. We believe that a vaccine is near and that we can stop an evil no one ever wanted.\nWe will recover. Governments and world leaders must acknowledge mistakes and be prepared going forward so that our health systems can face crises, such as the one we now face.\nWe can and must help each other, but we must learn from this frightful situation that beyond recovery, we must build a new society \u2014 one that is more supportive, equitable and just.\nTogether, as nations united, we will build the future we want. Let us make no mistake \u2014 multilateral action is the right path.\nThank you very much."

        "file_text": "Mr. President of the General Assembly,\nMr. Secretary General,\nExcellencies,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nAllow me to congratulate Mr. Volkan Bozkir on his election as President of the current session of the General Assembly and to wish him every success in his important term.\nAt the same time, I express my appreciation to Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande for the activity he performed as the President of the previous session.\nMr. President,\nOur participation in the proceedings of the General Assembly session is a privilege, even though the pandemic forces us to switch to the virtual regime. I believe the current session of the Assembly provides a good opportunity to celebrate together the 75th Anniversary of the creation of the United Nations and to reaffirm our common commitment to the values and principles enshrined in the UN Charter.\nSome politicians paraphrased Voltaire, saying that if the United Nations did not exist, it should have to be invented. We fully subscribe.\nSeen in retrospect of 75 years of its activity, the UN proved that it has no alternative globally, neither in terms of legitimacy and normative impact, nor in terms of its full engagement in solving international problems and crises, the way it had been emphasized in the recently adopted Declaration of celebration.\nWe hope that with the fulfilment of the reform package, especially of those targeting the UN development system, the Organization will give dynamism to our efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. I take this opportunity to personally thank the Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, for the launching and implementation of these complex reforms, which redefine the role and weight of the UN in the contemporary world. From this perspective, we consider it important to state during this session the continuous commitment and firm support of the Republic of Moldova for the United Nations.\nMr. President,\nWe live the challenge of an unprecedented year considering its breadth, complexity, and number of lasting crises. The coronavirus pandemic became one of the biggest challenges after the Second World War, triggering the current global crisis. The pandemic affected every country, generating devastating economic, social and political effects.\nThe Government of the Republic of Moldova, with the support of development partners, has focused on immediate priorities meant to support the healthcare system by purchasing essential medical equipment and materials. The fight against COVID-19 requires coordinated and transparent action at the global level. We also emphasize the importance of enhanced international cooperation, with manifested solidarity. We support the imperative need to ensure an universal access to treatment and vaccines, when they become available.\nIn the light of the above, we reiterate that the Republic of Moldova fully supports the agenda of the UN Secretary-General through the UN Global Crisis Response Plan, targeting the most disadvantaged social groups. We also welcome the creation of the Special Fund to support response and recovery measures for the fight against COVID-19 of low- and middle-income states, as a critical tool in addressing the crisis of the national healthcare systems and the economic and social consequences caused by virus.\nMr. President,\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development remains in our common focus and has an important roadmap towards a prosperous and peaceful world, where everyone can enjoy one\u2019s rights, living a decent life in safety.\nAfter five years of implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, the Republic of Moldova presented, in July, the first Voluntary National Report, which represented an exercise to map progress, challenges, and opportunities, to identify solutions and to accelerate its development.\nBy increasing the degree of prosperity, through the efforts of territorial reintegration of the country, by consolidating the rule of law, modernizing the social and economic infrastructure, we will generate, consequently, multiple opportunities for assertion, opportunities for involvement and active participation of every citizen.\nOver the last year we managed to achieve positive changes in the fight against corruption and we keep on working effectively on the justice reform - these are essential elements to ensure the much-needed momentum for our advancement. In order to increase the social protection of the citizens, we resorted to the indexation of pensions and allowances twice a year. The ambitious national road infrastructure rehabilitation program is in full swing. The recently initiated constitutional reform also aims at ensuring the sustainable development of the Republic of Moldova.\nI use this opportunity to express the deep concern of the Republic of Moldova in relation to the climate change and natural cataclysms. Our country fully shares the opinion that the conservation and rational use of biodiversity, especially the equitable distribution of benefits from the exploitation of genetic resources, are indispensable tools in advancing the implementation of the Agenda for Sustainable Development-2030 and the Vision for Biodiversity-2050.\nExcellencies, ladies and gentlemen,\nThis year we mark the 25th anniversary of the World Conference on Women in Beijing under the sign of action for inclusion and equality. The Republic of Moldova, along with 189 other nations, has adopted the General Declaration and Platform for Action on the Status of Women and their Equal Participation in All Areas of Public and Private Life.\nThus, we initiated several important reforms to ensure decent working conditions, eradicate poverty, expand social services for women, protect the health of the mother and child, strengthening the child protection system, building a peaceful and inclusive society.\nThe Republic of Moldova achieved a significant progress in terms of women\u2019s participation in the decision-making process. Our national law-making body and other important executive state institutions are currently led by women. The Republic of Moldova will continue to invest in human capital as a condition for progress.\nDistinguished audience,\nConflicts and crises of varying intensity continue to be a threat to peace, security, and development around the world. The Republic of Moldova supports the UN Secretary General\u2019s call for a global ceasefire. In the context of a global crisis, armed conflicts aggravate the situation and intensify the destructive effect of the armament race.\nAt the same time, the Republic of Moldova expresses a deep concern regarding the scale of the armament race through the excessive accumulation of conventional weapons and nuclear weapon modernization programs. We regret the persistent uncertainty of the situation related to the existing disarmament and control agreements of strategic armaments. On the background of emergence and escalation of increasing armed conflicts, we note globally enlarged military spendings and the weapons trading. In this respect, the international climate, marked by the use and threat of use of force, accentuates the insecurity of the international environment.\nOver recent years, the Republic of Moldova has expanded its contribution to the peacekeeping process, fully ensuring the substitution of the positions allocated to our country in international peacekeeping missions, in strict compliance with gender criteria and in the spirit of the Security Council resolution on Women, Peace and Security.\nIn this context, we believe that the UN Security Council, in particular its permanent members, must prove a greater responsibility and commitment to the objectives and principles of the Organization.\nMr. President,\nWe are witnessing interventions into the security balance in the world and, especially, in the Eastern Europe, where the Republic of Moldova is located. Despite our efforts, we note the lack of tangible progress in overcoming lasting conflicts.\nSince 1992, both within the UN and OSCE, as well as within other international platforms, the Republic of Moldova constantly addressed the issue of the Transnistrian conflict settlement. Despite our efforts, we must certify that the Transnistrian conflict still remains unresolved. The reasons could be explained by the lack of appropriate political will of some actors involved, by the existence of \u201cunderwater\u201d economic interests of some circles in different countries of the region we belong to, but also by the strongly pronounced geopolitical character of the Transnistrian problem.\nIn this regard, we emphasize the importance of a constructive approach of all actors engaged in the well-known 5+2 format and mandated to identify the final solution to the conflict. I am convinced that the guarantor states and the observers will put further efforts to quickly identify a comprehensive, peaceful, and viable solution. It will be based upon respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova within the internationally recognized borders, with the adoption of a special status for the Transnistrian region and the guaranteed political, economic and social rights of the population in this region.\nOver the recent years, we have focused on issues that require priority actions. These include ensuring and guaranteeing free movement throughout the country, creating a single economic space and promoting confidence-building measures.\nWe regret that the pandemic generated by COVID-19 has created new obstacles to the free movement of people, goods and services between the two banks of the Nistru river. They have a negative impact on human rights, strain the situation in the Security Zone, and delay progress in the negotiation process.\nThe adoption of a final political decision and the signing of relevant documents on complete settlement of the Transnistrian conflict is to be based exclusively on initiatives and proposals formulated directly by the Republic of Moldova, but not on those developed abroad. Therefore, we will put all the necessary efforts to ensure that a first draft of the Basic Parameters and Principles of the final settlement model is developed quickly and submitted in the first half of the upcoming year to all participants and stakeholders of the 5+2 format to be discussed and, deeply hoping, to find the common denominator for a solution of the conflict.\nIn this context, we call for a strengthened UN cooperation with the OSCE in managing peacekeeping operations, ensuring respect for and promoting fundamental human rights in conflict regions, facilitating mediation and conflict resolution. We rely very much on OSCE as a stabilizing factor at the regional level.\nAt the same time, we believe that the necessary preconditions exist for the resumption of the bilateral dialogue with the Russian Federation in order to identify a solution regarding the Cobasna stores. About 20 thousand tons of already obsolete ammunition remain stationed on the territory of the Republic of Moldova.\nWe are fully aware of the fact that the restoration of the territorial integrity and the functioning of the Republic of Moldova as a unitary and indivisible body are decisive in building of a modern, prosperous, and successful state.\nMr. President, ladies and gentlemen\nHistorically, the Moldovan state had an important feature: our country was formed on the crossroads of various civilizations, cultures, languages, religions, and geopolitical interests. Therefore, the multi-ethnic, multicultural nature of the country\u2019s development has been and remains the main feature of Moldova. A respectful, good- neighbourly attitude towards the linguistic differences of other ethnic groups has become the basis of existence of the Moldovan state and an important condition for its successful development. Living in peace and harmony on this land, representatives of different cultures, languages of communication and confessions have been working for the good and strengthening of the country, contributing to the development of Moldovan statehood for more than 660 years.\nFor my part, as President, I want to emphasize the leadership of Moldova is making every effort to preserve the atmosphere of friendliness, mutual assistance and respect for people of different ethnic origins, languages and religions in our country. As a result, almost every citizen of Moldova speaks several languages fluently, constantly discovers the peculiarities of the culture of different peoples, the Russian language has a special status as a language of interethnic communication, and this is an unconditional competitive advantage for realizing the capabilities of our citizens in the modern world.\nWe also believe the Republic of Moldova can successfully develop as an independent, sovereign, democratic, rule-of-law state actively pursuing a policy of permanent neutrality, based on desire of the Moldovan people for peaceful coexistence with other peoples and states of Europe and the world. We are confident that the permanent neutrality of Moldova, enshrined in the current Constitution, is the basis of our national, energy and information security, a guarantee of sustainable, long-term economic development and prosperity of the country.\nWe are sincerely grateful to the United Nations, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and other international organizations and partners that consistently support the Republic of Moldova. The dynamic development of Moldova with the assistance and large-scale support of international partners will contribute to strengthening the dialogue between the countries of our region and Europe as a whole.\nMr. President,\nThree years ago, I declared a balanced foreign policy as an important condition for ensuring the sustainable development of the Republic of Moldova.\nMoldova is a small country with a peaceful people. Obviously, there\u2019s no way we may try to fight someone. We want to work to quickly modernize our country and maintain mutually beneficial relations with the entire international community. Being a neutral state, we will not engage in the support of one state against another. Respectively, we do not admit to joining sanctions against our partners for development. I reiterate that, according to the Constitution of the Republic of Moldova, we are a neutral state and, therefore, we will not join any political-military bloc, either in the West or in the East.\nOver recent years, Moldova\u2019s foreign policy has been aimed at maintaining friendly relations and international partnerships, especially with our direct neighbours \u2014 Romania and Ukraine.\nA balanced foreign policy is crucial for ensuring the sustainable development of the Republic of Moldova, protecting it from contemporary geopolitical fluctuations.\nIn the West, our political relations and cooperation with the EU are guided by the Association Agreement signed in 2014 on strengthening the rule of law, democratic institutions, respect for human rights. Naturally, the European Union is a strategic partner for the Republic of Moldova in all areas of state\u2019 and Moldovan society\u2019s life.\nIndeed, Moldova is a European country due to its history and geographical position. We are an integral part of the Eastern European region. At the same time, the Republic of Moldova has a pronounced interference with the Eurasian space. By signing in 2018 the Memorandum of Cooperation with the Eurasian Economic Union, the Republic of Moldova obtained observer status in this organization \u2014 a fact that allows us to follow closely the evolution and prospects of this promising regional organisation. Over recent years we have managed to restore the strategic partnership with the Russian Federation.\nThus, one of our priorities is developing good political and economic cooperation with partners within the free trade areas of the European Union and Commonwealth of Independent States.\nExcellencies, ladies and gentlemen,\nThe 75th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations gives us a special opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to the goals and principles of the Organization. At the same time, the unity in action, solidarity and international cooperation, intensified in the fight against COVID-19, will help us cope with this important test of humanity\u2019s resilience.\nThank you!"

        "file_text": "Bismillah Rahman-ur-Rahim\nMr. President, ladies and gentlemen,\nWe, the peoples of the United Nations, this year observe our 75th anniversary. We do so at a time of unprecedented global turmoil. All of us here today share a common condition \u2014 a condition that does not distinguish between developed or developing countries. This turmoil that defines our times is a global phenomenon. And while all of us bear a share of the burden of this turmoil, some countries bear a much larger share than others.\nAfghanistan is one such country. We find ourselves simultaneously at the centre of regional opportunity and also at the centre of the manifestation of global problems. Afghanistan is positioned right at the heart of Asia. Our water ties us together; our cultures and languages give us a common denominator. South Asia\u2019s need for energy resources and Central Asia\u2019s abundance of them makes Afghanistan a critical connector. Asia cannot integrate without us. We are right at the heart of untapped potential that could bring prosperity and peace to our region. But this means that we are also right in the middle of the turmoil that is affecting us all today. We are experiencing the worst of it. But Afghanistan could be a model for successfully overcoming the turmoil we all face. That task, like the turmoil, is one that belongs to all of us.\nWe must first identify the drivers of this turmoil. There are five sources, all of which Afghanistan has been dealing with simultaneously. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed our vulnerabilities, to the point that we, as a global community, could no longer afford to ignore them. We Afghans were fortunate to have contained the first wave of the pandemic through close Government, business and societal cooperation, with minimal input from UN agencies, but the pandemic has exposed gaps in our systems that must be addressed.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has done for us what World War II did for generations before us \u2014 both had such immense human costs and were phenomenon that had such a global impact that then, and now, we are forced to pay attention and take unprecedented action.\nIn the face of vulnerabilities exacerbated by the pandemic, another driver of inequality and unemployment is upending our world \u2014 the 4th industrial revolution. The digital age is upon us, challenging us to adapt the ways we consume, the ways we work, and the ways we govern.\nIn Afghanistan, we are experimenting with how to adapt so that this digital revolution can be wielded as a source of economic opportunity for our overwhelmingly young population, as well as a way to strengthen our systems of governance and rule of law. We are looking far ahead with the knowledge that if we try to replicate 19th or 20th century models now, they will become irrelevant as soon as we stabilize them.\nThe same can be said for global attempts to harness the drive of the 4th industrial revolution \u2014 we have to think ahead of our time.\nThis new kind of industrial revolution, combined with the pandemic, presented challenges in planning and executing this very gathering, and yet the UNGA leadership has managed to creatively transform this experience into one that is more efficient, effective, convenient and far less risky. I want to congratulate His Excellency Volkan Bozkir not only on assuming the Presidency of this 75th Session of the UNGA, but also for his success in overcoming the particular challenge of hosting a massive gathering of global leaders during the pandemic.\nViolence and warfare have also evolved, an evolution we Afghans have witnessed and suffered in real time. We are living, and dying, inside the 5th wave of global terrorism, in which global terrorist networks are closely linked with global criminal networks, making warfare totally unconventional and peace-building even more of a challenge.\nAs a state and society, we have demonstrated the commitment, compassion and courage to take hard decisions to start direct peace talks with the Taliban. This won\u2019t be enough. For sustainable in Afghanistan, we must get to the root of the terrorism problem blighting our region and address it as the global phenomenon, and threat, that it is.\nThe untold sorrow of the Afghan people, particularly our women and children, during the last 40 years, serves as a reminder of the relevance of the UN Charter, and also of its unfulfilled promise, of \u201cmaintaining international peace and security.\u201d\nClimate change has effected another type of violence and suffering on our people. Afghanistan is the 17th worst affected country in the world.\nJust last month, hundreds of Afghans were killed or injured, and had their entire homes and livelihoods destroyed, when massive flood waters ripped through the province of Parwan and 13 other provinces. Two years before, the other extreme \u2014 drought \u2014 led us to nation-wide wheat shortages and upended the livelihoods of the majority of our population who rely on jobs in agriculture to put food on their tables.\nDrought and floods are seasonal occurrences for Afghanistan. We need regional solutions based on international models to address the problem of climate change.\nWe have signed memoranda of understanding with the Fortescue Metals Group to change Afghanistan into a leading green industry, energy and intend to produce 20,000 megawatts from hydro and use it to produce zero emissions steel and other products from an estimated $1 trillion in mineral resources.\nWe are also in discussion with other corporations to turn 70,000 megawatts of wind, and 220,000 megawatts of solar into renewable energy, thereby become a hub for renewable energy and green industry in the region.\nThe fifth driver of turmoil is a culmination of the first four \u2014 an unprecedented explosion of inequality that will continue to perpetuate this state of turmoil, until \u2014 or unless \u2014 we take action. In Afghanistan we are focusing on human capital and human security to create the equality of opportunities for our fellow citizen and societal stability for our people.\nI come back now to the first driver \u2014 the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 because the scope and scale of its impact forced us to see the other four drivers, which were worsened and highlighted by the pandemic.\nThe pandemic taught us an urgent lesson: We can no longer ignore these drivers.\nThe cost of our inaction is uncertainty.\nWe are asking ourselves at this General Assembly what kind of future do we want to live in?\nIn truth, the extreme levels of uncertainty make the future very difficult to predict, but if I were to try and address that question my answer would be simple.\nWe have to get back to basics. We have to go back to the foundational values of the United Nations and the documents that enshrine them \u2014 the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \u2014 and we have to fulfill these yet- unfulfilled promises.\nThe future must hold, to quote the preamble of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \u201c recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family,\u201d which is truly the \u201cfoundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.\u201d\nThese values have been embraced the world over. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is today universal discourse. Its values have been reflected in almost all state constitutions since the demise of the Soviet Union.\nBut these values have not been actualized.\nThese should not be lofty ideals and aspirations of the international community. They should be achievable goals. In Afghanistan, they are urgent and real problems we grapple with daily.\nWhat will it take to fulfill these promises of peace, prosperity, dignity, justice, and freedom?\nTo shape our shared future in a direction that will fulfill these promises for all of us will take unprecedented acts of cooperative and coordinated actions at all levels of the global village\u2019s community, economy and governance.\nWe need frameworks for the future that present pragmatic solutions for collectively addressing and solving the five drivers of turmoil, particularly global terrorism and climate change.\nThis will require the type of imagination and leadership that gave us the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN Charter and the capabilities that overcame the global turmoil inflicted on the world by the Second World War.\nWith these frameworks in place, we can get back to the foundational basics that the United Nations was created to address in the first place.\nThe United Nations that we need is an organization with the authorities, capabilities, capitals, and commitments to fulfill the purposes and principles of this Charter.\nI would like to commend His Excellency Secretary-General Guterres for the progress made so far in his reform agenda for the UN. But we have much further to go, and we all have a shared responsibility to shoulder in efforts to progress the sustainable development goals and progress peace, prosperity and security across the globe.\nIn Afghanistan, we are moving into the next five years with a clear plan for progressing the values of the UN, which are enshrined in our constitution, and working toward prosperity, security and peace in our own country.\nOur plan is based on building our markets for economic development, moving from an aid to a trade model, increasing our labor and capital productivity in key areas in which we have a competitive advantage.\nThe objective is self-reliance, moving away from donor relationships to mutually beneficial partnerships.\nAt the same time, we will invest in strengthening state governance structures to create an environment conducive to growth. This means continuing to combat systemic corruption, improving our public financial management systems, and strengthen provincial and district level governance.\nWe are looking closely at the gaps and weaknesses exposed by the pandemic, and strengthening our systems for the long-term.\nThough we are facing multiple drivers of turmoil all at once in Afghanistan, above all, peace remains our most urgent and important priority.\nThere is a passage from the preamble of the Charter of the United Nations that encapsulates our current goals for peace in Afghanistan. We want \u201cto save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and... to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security\u201d.\nThe role of the United Nations in standing for our shared values throughout the peace process is absolutely critical, and we thank the United Nations for their support so far throughout this arduous process. We thank the UN for their call for a global ceasefire.\nThe role of the UN and our international partners and allies will continue to be extremely important as our negotiating team sits across from the Taliban in Doha.\nAt those talks, the Afghan people have a clear and urgent priority: a ceasefire. An urgent end to the violence will, more than anything else, give us a chance to progress.\nI would like to take this opportunity to call on every member of the General Assembly and the Permanent Members of the Security Council to help us achieve the end-state of a sovereign, united and democratic Afghanistan, at peace with itself and the region, capable of preserving and expanding the gains of the last 19 years. A democratically stable and prosperous Afghanistan will be an example of how our collective will can overcome the turmoil and uncertainty that defines our world today. Thank You."

        "file_text": "Mister President, Mister Secretary-General, dear Heads of Delegations, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nI speak to you today on behalf of the European Union. A union founded, like the United Nations, on peaceful cooperation, human rights and fundamental freedoms. We are therefore an unwavering supporter of the United Nations. And of the international organisations to which we join forces for human progress.\nThis is precisely how we are working with the WHO to defeat COVID-19. Like the whole world, Europe has been hard hit by the pandemic. In the European Union, more than 142,000 people have lost their lives. I salute their memory, and all the COVID-19 victims worldwide. I also pay tribute to all the healthcare professionals that have safeguarded the fabric of our societies.\nThe crisis caused by the pandemic is unprecedented. It has exacerbated the weaknesses of fragile countries, regions and populations. It has also revealed the fragility of countries that thought they were strong. It has thrown us all into the same sudden battle, against the same common enemy.\nThe European Union, for its part, has been at the forefront of international cooperation which has raised nearly \u20ac16 billion to finance the research and the deployment of vaccines, tests and treatments. And we are mobilized, alongside all the players involved, to ensure that these vaccines and treatments are universally accessible and affordable.\nEach nation and each leader has the duty to reflect on the best way to contribute to our common objective. This is true in the fight against the current crisis, as in all global challenges. Kofi Annan said: \u201cTo become a good citizen, start in your own community!\u201d It is in this vein that I want to explain why the European Union wants to become stronger and strategically autonomous, alongside an open market. Stronger not only for itself. But also to better contribute to a better world. The crisis has made this goal even more essential. It has awakened a new collective responsibility, to build back better and greener...\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nBefore the crisis, Europe had already embarked on a path of fundamental transformation. For example, by deciding to become the first carbon-neutral continent by 2050. Or by adopting an ambitious digital agenda, in line with our fundamental values.\nThis pandemic has increased our determination to transform our economies and societies tenfold. \u20ac540 billion have been mobilized for urgent measures from the outset. Then, in July, the European Council decided to mobilise ambitious and unprecedented financial resources: more than \u20ac1.8 trillion for the coming years, including \u20ac750 billion raised via the issuance of European Union bonds, unprecedented in its nature and size. With this historic decision, we have come together, united and strong, to better assume our responsibilities.\nResponsibility begins by seeing things as they are, and not as we would like them to be. In today\u2019s world, the abuse of force, both military and economic, too often supplants argumentation and negotiation. Respect for treaties, a basic principle of international law, comes to be considered optional even by those who, until recently, were its historical guarantors. All this in the name of partisan interests.\nMore than ever, the European Union is defending the rules-based international order and cooperation based on universal values. The European Union wants to be stronger, more autonomous, and firmer, to defend a fairer world. And it is in this spirit that we lead the implementation of the Paris Agreements. And that we have already integrated the objectives of the 2030 Agenda into our system of economic governance.\nWe are now developing these values and this open model with greater awareness of our strength, with more realism, and perhaps less naivety. We have faith in the virtues of free and open economies, never in protectionism. But access to our large market \u2014 the second largest economic zone in the world, and the first in terms of international trade \u2014 will no longer be sold off. From now on, we will better enforce the level playing field, in a market open to those who respect its standards. Whether they leave our Union or want to move closer to it.\nThe European Union is also committed to advancing overall tax fairness, in particular in the digital sector. Large-scale activities carried out in this area can no longer escape fair taxation. The European Union is committed, alongside the OECD and the G20, to international cooperation to correct this injustice.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nThe European Union is an actor for peace and progress, which wants to mobilise its influence and strength to make others more robust as well.\nWe support the six partners of the Western Balkans in their transformation and integration. We have reaffirmed their European perspective. And we have just decided to open accession negotiations with two more countries among them: Albania and the Republic of North Macedonia.\nThrough the Eastern Partnership, we are developing our relations with six countries in our neighbourhood. Notably with a view to strengthening institutions and the rule of law. In Belarus, the last presidential election was falsified. We do not accept the results. And we condemn the violent repression of the opposition and of peaceful demonstrations. Repression and intimidation must stop, and all those responsible must be held accountable and sanctioned. We stand with the Belarusian people who must be free, without any external coercion, to choose their own future. Inclusive national dialogue, with OSCE facilitation, is the only realistic path forward.\nFighting impunity also means demanding an independent and credible investigation when the Russian opposition leader Navalny is the victim of an assassination attempt with chemical weapons.\nThe European Union is also on the side of the Venezuelan people. That is why we are working with the International Contact Group for a peaceful and negotiated solution that must include free, credible and fair elections.\nThe relationship between Europe and Africa will, I am sure, be the backbone of a fairer and stronger world. Together, we represent some 80 nations and 1.7 billion citizens in this Assembly, the vast majority of whom are among the youngest on the planet. Our two continents have never been so interdependent, for better or for worse. To acknowledge this is neither sterile Afro-pessimism nor naive Afro-optimism. It is to recognize that this interdependence is also a calling. It is to recognize that a strong Europe needs a strong Africa, and vice versa. The potential is huge. Investing, innovating, developing infrastructure, promoting education, supporting health systems: this is the key to forging a mutually beneficial partnership. Let us get inspired by the power of the African concept of Ubuntu: the way of thinking that my humanity is inextricably linked to yours, our destinies are linked, and our individual actions succeed only if they make sense for the common good. This principle of Ubuntu is also the reason for my renewed call to settle the question of debts of the poorest countries, in a spirit of solidarity that also takes into account the effects of the pandemic.\nThe European Union is concerned about tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. Unilateral actions and violations of international law must absolutely stop. Together with our Member States, we are undertaking intensive diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions and to promote dialogue. In this spirit, I have proposed the organization of a multilateral conference on the Eastern Mediterranean, in conjunction with the United Nations. Many actors have already responded positively and are ready to discuss the modalities, the agenda and the timetable. Maritime delimitations, security, energy issues, and migration are some of the topics that I believe should be addressed.\nWe also support the efforts of the United Nations, and where involved, regional organizations, like in Libya or Syria.\nThe Iran Nuclear Deal remains key for global non-proliferation and regional security. It is therefore essential to preserve the JCPOA and for all parties to fully implement it. The agreement endorsed by UN Security Council Resolution 2231 (2015) remains in place and for us there is no doubt that the sanctions lifting commitments under the agreement continue to apply. While we strongly support the preservation of the Iran deal, we continue to firmly address other concerns, such as the domestic and the regional situation.\nWe also welcome the start of intra-Afghan negotiations and will support a lasting peace.\nIn a tormented region, the issue of peace between Palestinians and Israelis is timelier than ever. We must continue to support the legitimate aspirations of both parties. And we remain firmly committed to the two-state solution. We will spare no effort with our international partners, including the Quartet, to facilitate the return of Israelis and Palestinians to the negotiating table, to find a negotiated solution within internationally agreed parameters. For our commitment to international law and UN resolutions is unwavering. At the same time, we welcome Israel\u2019s rapprochement with countries in the region as a positive development for peace and stability in the Middle East.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nSince I became President of the European Council, I have often been asked a question that is both simple and brutal: \u201cIn the new rivalry between the United States and China, which side is the European Union on?\u201d\nMy answer is the following...\nWe are deeply connected with the United States. We share ideals, values and a mutual affection that have been strengthened through the trials of history. They remain embodied today in a vital transatlantic alliance. This does not prevent us from occasionally having divergent approaches or interests.\nWe do not share the values on which the political and economic system in China is based. And we will not stop promoting respect for universal human rights. Including those of minorities such as the Uighurs. Or in Hong Kong, where international commitments guaranteeing the rule of law and democracy are being questioned.\nChina is a crucial partner in addressing common challenges, such as global warming, COVID-19 or debt relief in Africa. And China is also an important trade partner. Yet we are determined to rebalance this relationship towards greater reciprocity and fairer competition. A spirit that we are also cultivating with ASEAN members, with which we will continue to deepen our relationship.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nWe stand on the side of the fundamental values of democracy, human rights, the rule of law and cooperation. It\u2019s our compass to pursue our interests. The European Union is an autonomous force, master of our choices, master of our destiny.\nFinally, on behalf of the European Union, I want to reaffirm this essential conviction: there can be no progress without progress in women\u2019s empowerment. Discrimination against women remains one of the major obstacles to development. We must fight this relentlessly. Equality between men and women, as well as the protection of diversity, particularly sexual diversity, remains one of the major challenges of our time.\nThe European Union will continue to be a driving force for multilateralism and the rules-based international order. Our support for the UN remains as strong as ever, and we will continue to support the implementation of the Secretary General\u2019s reforms. Because we need a strengthened and effective multilateral system. This requires an even stronger UN to deliver results that advance world peace. Europe, stronger and more resolute, will be at your side to make the world a better and fairer place to live.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President of the United Nations General Assembly, Volkan Bozkir,\nMr. Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, whom I am pleased to greet in our mother tongue, Heads of State, Government and Delegation,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nIt is an honor to open this Assembly together with representatives of sovereign nations, at a point in time when the world needs the truth to overcome its challenges.\nCOVID-19 has become the center of attention over the course of this year and, first of all, I wish to express my sorrow for each and every life lost.\nFrom the very beginning, in my country, I warned that we had two problems to solve, the virus and joblessness, and that both issues had to be addressed simultaneously and with the same sense of responsibility.\nAs determined by court ruling in Brazil, all measures involving social distancing and restrictions of movement were delegated to each of the 27 Governors in the Federation. The President, in turn, was assigned the responsibility for sending out resources nationwide.\nAs was the case in much of the world, segments of the Brazilian media have also politicized the virus by spreading panic among the population. Under the mottoes \u201cstay at home\u201d and \u201cwe will deal with the economy later on\u201d, they almost brought about social chaos to the country.\nBut our administration in a bold step put in place several economic measures that prevented a greater evil.\nEmergency relief was granted in installments adding up to approximately $1,000 for 65 million people, the largest assistance program for the poorest in Brazil and perhaps one of the largest in the world.\nMore than $100 billion were allocated to cover health related actions and help small and micro enterprises; measures were also taken to offset the loss in revenue collection in state and local governments.\nMore than 200,000 indigenous families were assisted with foodstuffs and covid prevention efforts.\nIn close contact with healthcare professionals, we encouraged early treatment of the disease.\n$400 million were dedicated to the research, development and production of the Oxford vaccine in Brazil. In Brazil, hospitals did not lack the means to cater to covid patients.\nThe pandemic teaches us a major lesson, which is that we cannot possibly depend on just a few nations for the production of essential inputs and means for our survival. The hydroxychloroquine input production alone had a 500 per cent price increase at the onset of the pandemic.\nBrazil is thus open for the development of state-of-the-art technology and innovation efforts, such as 4.0 Industry, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology and 5G technology, with all partners who respect our sovereignty and cherish freedom and data protection.\nIn Brazil, despite the world crisis, agricultural production never stopped. Farmers have worked harder than ever, producing food to feed over 1 billion people.\nBrazil has indeed helped to continuously feed the world. Our truck drivers, maritime, port and aviation workers have kept the entire logistics chain fully active and ensured distribution domestically and into the export markets.\nOur agribusiness remains vibrant and thriving and, above all, it has and respects the best environmental legislation on the planet.\nEven so, we are victims of a most brutal disinformation campaign about the Amazon and the Brazilian wetlands.\nThe Brazilian Amazon is known to be immensely rich. That explains the support given by international institutions to this disinformation campaign anchored on shady interests coupled with exploitative and unpatriotic Brazilian associations with the purpose of undermining the Government and Brazil itself.\nWe are leaders when it comes to the conservation of tropical rainforests. We have the world\u2019s cleanest and most diversified energy mix.\nEven as one of the world\u2019s ten largest economies, we account for only 3 per cent of carbon emissions worldwide.\nWe provide food security to one sixth of the world\u2019s population, even while preserving 66 per cent of our native vegetation and using only 27 per cent of our territory for animal husbandry and agriculture. These are figures that no other country has.\nBrazil stands out as the world\u2019s largest producer of foodstuffs. And for that reason there is such a strong interest in spreading out disinformation about our environment.\nWe are open to the world to offer our very best, i.e., our agricultural products. We have never exported so much. The world increasingly relies on Brazil to feed itself.\nOurs is a tropical rainforest and as such it does not allow fire to be spread out within it. Fire outbreaks tend to occur virtually at the same places, in the eastern surroundings of the forest, where Brazilians of indigenous ancestry burn their farmlands in search of livelihood in already cleared areas.\nCriminal fire outbreaks are fought with stringency and determination. I stand by my zero tolerance policy towards environmental crime. Together with Congress, we have sought land regularization with a view to identify the perpetrators of these criminal acts.\nMay I call to mind that the Amazon Region is larger than the whole of Western Europe. Hence, the difficulty of fighting not only fire outbreaks, but also illegal logging and biopiracy. In response, we are currently expanding and enhancing the use of technology and improving inter-agency operations, which include the engagement of the Armed Forces.\nOur wetlands, with an area larger than many European countries, just as California, faces the same problems. Large fires are the inevitable consequence of high local temperature coupled with the accumulation of decaying organic matter.\nOur concern for the environment goes beyond our forests. Brazil\u2019s National Marine Debris Program, one of the very first initiatives of this kind, has designed a strategy for our coastline, which spans over 8,500 km.\nAccordingly, Brazil made every effort at the COP25 in Madrid to establish, under the provisions of the Paris Agreement, an effective international carbon market. Unfortunately, however, the forces of protectionism prevailed.\nIn 2019, Brazil was the victim of a criminal seepage of Venezuelan oil, sold without proper control, which resulted in serious damage to the environment and major losses to the fishing and tourism industries.\nBrazil deems it important to respect the freedom of navigation as established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nAccordingly, environmental protection rules must be respected and criminal acts investigated in a timely fashion, so as to ensure that criminal offenses such as that perpetrated against Brazil will not affect other countries.\nBrazil stands out not only on the environmental preservation front, but also on the humanitarian and human rights agenda, an area where Brazil has become an international benchmark reference given our commitment and dedication in supporting Venezuelan refugees who reach Brazil through the border state of Roraima.\nOperation Welcome, led by the Brazilian Ministry of Defense, has received almost 400,000 Venezuelans displaced as a result of the deep political and economic crisis bred by the Venezuelan dictatorship.\nMore than 4,000 Brazilian members of the military have taken part in the operation, which consists of a humanitarian logistical task force with a view to welcoming, sheltering and internalizing newly arrived families at the border.\nAs a founding member of the United Nations, Brazil is committed to the basic principles of the UN Charter: peace and international security, cooperation among nations, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. As the organization reaches its 75th anniversary, we now have the opportunity to renew our commitment and loyalty to these ideals.\nPeace cannot possibly be dissociated from security. Cooperation among peoples cannot possibly be dissociated from freedom.\nBrazil has enshrined the principles of peace, cooperation and the prevalence of human rights in its own Constitution, and has traditionally contributed to translate them into reality.\nBrazil has by now taken part in more than 50 peacekeeping operations and related missions and has, as such, contributed with more than 55,000 members of the military, police officers and civilians, with remarkable involvement in the Suez Canal, Angola, East Timor, Haiti, Lebanon and the Congo.\nTwo Brazilian female members of the military were acknowledged by the United Nations for their work against sexual violence as part of the UN Mission in the Central African Republic.\nWe remain committed to completing the trade agreements signed between Mercosur and the European Union as well as the European Free Trade Association. These agreements contain important provisions that reinforce our commitment to environmental protection.\nUnder my administration, Brazil finally puts behind a protectionist tradition and has now adopted trade liberalization as a key tool for growth and transformation.\nI reaffirm our commitment to the reform of the World Trade Organization, which must provide us with the relevant disciplines in line with the new international realities.\nWe are also approaching the official process for Brazil\u2019s accession to the OECD. To that end, we have already put in place the world\u2019s highest standards in all areas, to include financial regulation, digital security and environmental protection.\nIn my first year in office, we have successfully carried out the pension reform and, more recently, we submitted two new reform bills to Congress, to include the tax system and the administrative reform of the state apparatus.\nNew regulatory frameworks in key sectors, such as sanitation and natural gas, are also being put in place. They will attract more investments, provide economic stimulus and create jobs and income.\nIn 2019, Brazil was the world\u2019s fourth largest destination of foreign direct investment and, in the first half of 2020, despite the pandemic, we have seen an increase in the inflow of investments as compared to the same period of last year. This is a clear-cut evidence of the world\u2019s confidence in our government. In coordination with South Atlantic partners, Brazil has been working to reinvigorate the South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone.\nBrazil is concerned with and repudiates terrorism in all parts of the world.\nIn Latin America, we continue to strive for the preservation and promotion of democracy as a cornerstone of the economic progress we all desire.\nLiberty is humankind\u2019s greatest asset.\nI call upon the entire international community to protect religious freedom and fight against Christophobia. I also wish to reaffirm my solidarity and support for the people of Lebanon in the wake of the recent hardships they have endured.\nWe believe that the time is right for us to open up new and more optimistic horizons for the future of the Middle East. The peace agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and between Israel and Bahrain \u2014 three friends of Brazil with which our government has greatly strengthened relations \u2014 are excellent news.\nBrazil also welcomes the Plan for Peace and Prosperity launched by President Donald Trump, which features a promising vision to resume the path towards a much- desired solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict after more than seven decades of efforts.\nBrazil\u2019s new policy of simultaneously pursuing closer relations with Israel and the Arab countries is very much in line with those initiatives, which finally shine a light of hope for that region.\nBrazil is a Christian and conservative country, and has family as its foundation.\nMay God bless us all.\nThank you very much."

I wish you every success in discharging your tasks. I assure you my country\u2019s delegation\u2019s readiness to cooperate with you in order to achieve the objectives of the session.\nI would also like to express my thanks and appreciation to your predecessor, Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, for his efforts during his presidency of the previous session. I would also be remiss if I did not mention the ongoing efforts of Secretary- General Antonio Guterres to fulfil the principles and purposes of the United Nations.\nRegrettably, this year\u2019s session is being held amid difficult and cruel international circumstances caused by COVID-19, which disregards geographical borders and does not discriminate among people. The pandemic continues to cause significant loss of life and pose a threat to all services and production sectors, especially in poor countries affected by instability and conflict. As the Secretary- General has stressed on several occasions, we can overcome the pandemic only through solidarity, greater mutual international cooperation and concerted efforts.\nEach time I have the opportunity to address the Assembly, I wish that I could talk about the end of the difficult transition period facing my country and its success in overcoming grave challenges. I wish that I could say that my country is on the path to building a civilian, democratic State where power is peacefully transferred, the rule of law is respected and human rights and dignity are protected.\nHowever, regrettably, some seek to undermine these aspirations, for which the Libyan people have made considerable sacrifices. They continue to make every effort, regardless of how destructive or unjust, to seize power and rule by force. Nevertheless, we are determined to pursue the goals for which martyrs made the ultimate sacrifice. The heroes of our national army and armed forces have proven that they can defeat anyone who seeks to impose dictatorship and the rule of the individual.\nWe kept our promise when we stated that invaders would not enter Tripoli. On 4 April 2019, the city remained resilient in the face of a tyrannical attack led by the aggressors and militias that support them. It resulted in countless human and material losses. Our heroes made the ultimate sacrifice during Operation Volcano of Rage and we were able to deter and defeat the aggression. Regrettably, it was supported by countries known to everyone and mentioned in United Nations reports.\nThis is unacceptable because it violates Libyan sovereignty and independence, Security Council resolutions and international law, which prohibit interference in the internal affairs of States. There is no doubt that such conduct cannot be compared to legitimate agreements concluded by the legitimate Government with some States.\nAs new developments emerge with the aggressor\u2019s defeat and the victory of the Libyan people, we are determined to overcome all obstacles and build a democratic State. We call on these States to revisit their positions and refrain from relying on the aggressors. Instead, they should discuss with the Government of National Accord how to find solutions to their concerns. We must work to establish and promote cooperation based on mutual respect, common interests and the principle of noninterference in the internal affairs of States.\nWe have stressed on all occasions our commitment to peaceful means through constructive dialogue as the only way out of the crisis. We engage positively with a United Nations-led peace process and offer it every assistance in this regard. We also engage in good faith in initiatives to reach a solution, as demonstrated at the recently held Berlin Conference. We have put forward several initiatives to resolve the political and security crisis, as well as plans and programmes to address the daily challenges faced by Libyans. We have constantly proven that we want peace, not war and destruction.\nWhile we possess the strength and faith to resist and defeat the aggressor, we want to prevent bloodshed and loss of life. We also want to unite our efforts to combat COVID-19 pandemic, which is a threat to our citizens. We announced a ceasefire on 21 August and have called for elections by March of next year. We have underscored that an effective and lasting ceasefire requires that the regions of Sirte and Jufra be free of weapons. Foreign forces and mercenaries must withdraw from both districts and from Libyan territory as a whole. That is how we guarantee the sovereignty of Libyan territory established by the Government of National Accord.\nWe welcome the regional and international support for this initiative and look forward to practical measures that could swiftly lead to full withdrawal from the aforementioned areas.\nThe mercenaries should return to their countries and ports and oil fields must be reopened immediately. Outside influences forced their closure, which led to an estimated $9 billion in losses, in addition to considerable damage in the oil infrastructure.\nWe welcomed the statement by political leaders in eastern Libya, calling for a ceasefire and the resumption of oil production. However, we have not yet seen response from the armed groups and militias. Instead, their spokesman issued hostile statements and we have seen breaches by their forces, backed up by the mercenaries. We hold them responsible for military confrontations and all subsequent casualties and destruction.\nWe have made many attempts to improve the living conditions of Libyans, strengthen the service sectors and limit the proliferation of weapons and insecurity. In many cases, through cooperation with the United Nations Support Mission in Libya, we have achieved tangible progress. However, these efforts have been unsustainable because of external negative interventions and division among our institutions, as well as stalled oil production, which is our main source of income.\nWe have always known that the policies of an elected Government of national unity are required to address these challenges. Therefore, we reiterate our call for an agreement based on the Constitution and for the holding of presidential and parliamentary elections. We look forward to strong international support. We also welcome the effective contribution of the United Nations to ensure the requirements for successful elections, for which Libyans who believe in democracy and State institutions have waited far too long.\nUndoubtedly, this will end the legitimacy crisis. To that end, we believe that we must hasten to resume the political dialogue and include all stakeholders \u2014 all political factions and parties, all regions and all segments of society, regardless of their affiliation or ideology. The only exception would be those proven to have committed crimes and to have spilled Libyan blood.\nPertaining to human rights issues, we emphasize our determination to protect and promote these rights. To that end, we have issued a number of laws at the national level. Despite the challenges we face, we are striving to fulfil our international obligations under the relevant international conventions and are currently reviewing our accession to further treaties and conventions that promote human rights. We also attach great importance to the promotion of women\u2019s rights and gender equality and we continue to provide free education and health care to all citizens.\nThe aggression against Tripoli constituted a flagrant violation of all principles of human rights, with indiscriminate bombings that have caused death, destruction and displacement. The use of landmines and field executions revealed mass graves in the city of Tarhouna after the aggressor had been defeated.\nThose gross violations of human rights were addressed by the Human Rights Council, which responded to our demands and formed a relevant commission of inquiry. We welcome that measure and reiterate our readiness to cooperate and facilitate the work of the Council. We also call on the Council to investigate the violations suffered by citizens of the city of Sirte at the hands of Haftar\u2019s militias, the most recent of which included the detention of a number of men and the execution of one in front of his family.\nThe Government of National Accord is committed to safeguarding the right of citizens to peacefully express themselves, as enshrined by the law, and to protect demonstrators, allowing them to express their opinions and their legitimate demands for better living conditions, better services and an end to corruption. We will not allow any attempt to oppress them by force.\nMy country reaffirms its rejection and condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, whatever its source or motive. We stress that terrorism is a global phenomenon that should not be attributed to any religion or creed. My country has made great sacrifices to eliminate terrorist organizations that included a number of foreign fighters, such as the foreign Da\u2019esh organization. By targeting Libya, Da\u2019esh threatened our security, stability and safety, as well as our natural resources, which it sought to exploit in the service of its evil plans, which have nothing to do with Islam.\nLibya has ratified all international conventions related to the fight against terrorism and considers the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and its four pillars to be one of the most important legal frameworks to facilitate counterterrorism through national legislation. The promotion of regional and international cooperation remains the best way to track down and eliminate terrorist networks and, in that connection, we must highlight the need to support regional and subregional counter-terrorism plans and programmes. In Libya, for example, we are cooperating with some of our neighbours on joint border control efforts in order to arrest and prosecute terrorists.\nMy country is continuously concerned by the phenomenon of irregular migration and acknowledges the urgent need to address the continued flow of migrants who are exposed to great dangers, including exploitation by human trafficking networks. Irregular migration represents a human tragedy that the international community has thus far been unable to resolve. As a transit country, Libya is facing serious economic, social and security repercussions as a result of that phenomenon, which has exacerbated instability in our country and reflected negatively on Libyan society. It has become difficult to address such a phenomenon without external cooperation and assistance commensurate with its challenges and serious repercussions.\nWe look forward to further collaboration with the international organizations with which we have consulted and coordinated in order to obtain realistic and objective data on migrants in Libya and the hardships they face. We do not believe that unilateral reports containing inaccurate and exaggerated information are helpful in reaching meaningful solutions. Such reports are disappointing because they focus on alleged violations by the relevant authorities in the country without mention of the same authorities\u2019 efforts to serve the interests of migrants. The same reports neglect to mention the fact that more than half a million irregular migrants live peacefully among Libyans, working in various sectors and sending funds back to their families in their countries of origin.\nThere is broad international consensus that addressing the challenges of migration exceeds the capacity of any individual country. Libya is a victim and not a cause of irregular migration, and therefore we reaffirm that the best solution is to address the root causes that drive people to flee their countries of origin. It is imperative that the international community assist those countries and encourage them to implement real development programmes and improve services, sparing no effort to eradicate poverty, unemployment and all other hardships that lead people to embark on life-threatening migration.\nMy country attaches great importance to disarmament and the promotion of international peace and security, demonstrated by our active participation in discussions on the topic and our co-sponsorship of a number of United Nations resolutions. We continue to respect all relevant international treaties and conventions, in line with our understanding of the threat posed to international peace and security by the production and stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction and the horror they cause for all humankind. Libya also contributes to international efforts to eliminate weapons of mass destruction and to maintain international peace and security.\nIt has been almost five years since we began implementing the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, but we are concerned by the serious challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic that undermine the gains made and impede further progress. Libya continues to face many challenges with regard to achieving the SDGs, in particular due to insecurity and political instability in the country.\nWe are all aware that there can be no development without security and vice versa. In that context, we look forward to overcoming the difficulties we are currently experiencing so that we can launch real development plans and programmes and promote the economy in order to meet the SDGs.\nIt is vital to mobilize local resources and employ them in the implementation of development programmes. Much of Libya\u2019s funds have been drained from the country; we therefore call on the States into which those funds were smuggled to assist in their retrieval.\nIn that connection, we wish to refer to the frozen assets of the Libyan sovereign wealth fund, which have been exposed to losses as a result of the sanctions imposed by the Security Council since 2011. We underscore that the purpose of those sanctions were to preserve Libyan assets and funds, not continue eroding them.\nIn reality, we are suffering great losses as a result of the frozen status of those funds and assets. Since March 2016, we have been providing the Security Council and the Sanctions Committee with clear and consecutive data on the scale of the heavy losses we are incurring and we have called for amendments to the existing sanctions regime to avoid such heavy losses. Unfortunately, we have not yet received an effective response to our legitimate request.\nMy delegation supports the reforms led by the Secretary-General with regard to certain United Nations organs. Despite the progress achieved thus far in that regard, the Security Council, which is the Organization\u2019s most important organ, remains far from being adequately reformed. It is essential to introduce genuine reforms to the Security Council, which no longer reflects the contemporary international realities and the serious challenges of the twenty-first century that constitute a threat to international peace and security.\nThe current geopolitical reality is ripe for reform and equitable representation in the Council. Accordingly, we emphasize our demand for the need to rectify the historical injustices inflicted upon the African continent in terms of lack of fair representation in both the permanent and non-permanent membership of the Council. We reaffirm the demands of the African Union, contained in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, for two permanent seats with all rights and powers, including the veto power, and two additional non-permanent seats. Those demands are just and reflect the right of the African continent to effectively participate in the decisions taken by the Council, which are often focused on African issues. Those demands also represent the bare minimum to be done in order to rectify the historic marginalization and injustices inflicted upon the African continent. In that context, I must also express our support for the demand made by the Group of Arab States for a permanent seat in the Council.\nPeace in the Middle East will never be achieved as long as the occupying Power continues to occupy Palestinian territories, establishing more settlements, threatening to annex more land and imposing more unjust blockades, in total disregard for all related international resolutions.\nWe join the Palestinian people in rejecting the practices of the occupying authorities and in demanding the right of the Palestinian people to establish an independent State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. We also express our rejection of all attempts to abuse the Palestinian question in order to serve non-Palestinian interests or reach agreements that the Palestinians themselves neither agree with nor participate in. Libya will continue to support the Palestinian question and the Palestinian people in their quest to establish their long-sought independent State, for which they have given thousands of martyrs.\nIn conclusion, I wish to underscore that a democratic and civilian State is the aspiration of the Libyan people, as the reason for their revolt and the goal for which we continue to strive. We aspire to live in a State where there is a peaceful transfer of power, human rights are respected, human dignity is preserved and the law limits abuses, whatever their source. We aspire to build a State that lives in peace and achieves development, that cooperates with its neighbours and that renounces violence and fights against terrorism and extremism.\nLibya possesses the capabilities and natural resources, as well as the strategic and distinguished location, to achieve those aspirations. With the assistance of our friends, the Libyans can establish a prosperous future for our country. We hope to bring this painful chapter in our nation\u2019s history to a swift end as we transform into a democratic and pluralistic State where cultural diversity is respected \u2014 a State of laws and institutions."

        "file_text": "His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres\nSecretary General of the United Nations\nHis Excellency Volkan Bozkir\nPresident of the 75th General Assembly of the United Nations\nYour Excellencies Heads of State and Governments\nYour Excellencies Ministers of Foreign Affairs\nHonorable Heads of Delegation\nCitizens of the world.\nWhen the representatives of 51 nations, including mine, signed the Charter of the United Nations in San Francisco on 26 June 1945, the world was still in flames.\nThe horrors unleashed by the Second World War were still atrocious realities against which the international community conspired so they would never happen again. As a result of that commitment to peace and dialogue among peoples, this Organization was born in whose General Assembly I am honored to participate today for the first time on behalf of the Dominican people, and in whose name I congratulate the United Nations on its 75th Anniversary.\nThe world of 2020 is evidently different from that of 1945 and I am confident to proclaim that it is also better. And it is so, to a large extent, thanks to the United Nations effort during these three quarters of a century to maintain international peace and security, encourage cooperation between peoples to solve global problems and serve, ultimately, as meeting point for the nations that share this planet.\nWithout the UN the Universal Declaration of Human Rights would not exist, something inconceivable for us today; neither would we have organizations like UNICEF, FAO, the World Health Organization, the World Bank or international criminal courts. Nor would have been carried out the peacekeeping missions that, through its history, have avoided so much suffering.\nThe world of 2020 is better than in 1945 but far from perfect. New challenges and threats bring global problems whose scale requires joint solutions that can only be solved through loyal cooperation among the 193 nations represented in this Assembly.\n75 years ago, the international community had to take on the colossal challenge posed by reconstruction after the ravages of war, which in turn brought about additional obstacles that required commitment, imagination and work to overcome.\nHowever, it would be reckless to deceive ourselves. History is not linear; at every crossroads there is always the risk of setbacks that hinder goals achieved towards development, progress and peace, which are always so hard to reach.\nTherefore, as leaders and servants of our respective nations, we must know there is zero margin of error if we intend to face the challenges of our time in our own way and alone.\nIf in the 75 years of the UN\u2019s existence, multilateralism and international cooperation have been valuable tools, now they are essential and it is imperative that everyone do their part.\nThat this meeting of the General Assembly has to be held by videoconference is already the perfect example of the main problem we, as leaders and servants of our respective peoples, must face. Covid-19 has put the entire planet in check joining threats such as climate change, which affects us all, but it is highly serious in island countries like the Dominican Republic. I am not exaggerating if I say that both dangers could bring other conflicts into the equation; which will, as usual, viciously prey upon the most vulnerable.\nAs a non-permanent member of the Security Council, the Dominican Republic has made a special contribution to the agenda of the Protection of Civilians in Conflict in the Context of Covid-19 through a Presidential Declaration that had the unanimous agreement of the Council. That is the spirit that should prevail in the immediate future when it comes to carrying out the policies allowing us to stop the pandemic first, extend treatment and vaccination later, and in the meantime, rebuilding what the pandemic has damaged.\nIn the Dominican Republic, the pandemic has hit us particularly hard because we have had a precarious social protection system, with per capita social spending of $604 compared to the regional average of $941. While the paradox exists that we are one of the nations with the highest economic growth in the region, it has not managed, so far, to close the equity gap.\nWe all here know, the equity gap will only be fixed by investing in Health and Education. This is why my Government is launching the most ambitious public health program in our history to achieve universal coverage by the end of the year as we increase public investment in the National Health System.\nAlong with this, there is a plan to promote quality Education that, among other measures, will provide students and teachers with electronic devices so that Covid-19 does not disturb at all their educational process. The future does not wait, and our students cannot miss a minute of their learning.\nAnd this is why our young people are one of our top priorities; we will work to ensure they get the best education. In this sense, I believe there is no better education than a comprehensive one that encourages students\u2019 participation in all areas affecting them. Proof of this is the acceptance of the Dominican-French initiative to promote resolution 2535 (2020) \u2014 adopted unanimously by the Security Council in July 2020 \u2014 to strengthen the member states\u2019 commitment to the global agenda of youth, peace and security and that directly involves young people in these plans.\nHowever, talking about peace and security without talking about development is, simply and plainly, wasting time. Before the pandemic this Organization was already in a reform process to assist Member States in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda.\nIt is evident that achieving these objectives requires an \u201caccelerated implementation\u201d with the purposeful commitment of the developed countries.\nHowever, five years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, the majority of developing countries are lagging behind, and those middle-income nations - such as the Dominican Republic\u2014 face particular challenges, because although their economies are advancing institutional weaknesses prevail that lead to inequality. It is therefore essential to modify that Agenda so it responds to the reality and problems facing each country.\nThe Dominican Republic will spare no effort with the 2030 Agenda, because for years our country has been implementing a National Development Strategy that shares objectives with the United Nations Agenda. Yet, I recognize, to achieve full compliance in just ten years is a challenge requiring the collaboration of all civil society, with public-private collaboration with a national vision, and keeping in mind the essential assistance needed by lagging countries.\n75 years ago, this organization was born with the purpose of banishing forever from the international community\u2019s vocabulary the \u201cwe\u201d versus \u201cyou\u201d or \u201cthem\u201d to assume the \u201ceveryone\u201d. And this is what Covid-19 intends to put to the test. But I predict it will fail if this Assembly assumes the threat will be annulled through policies not combining the legitimate national interests of each country with the global solutions adopted by the entire international community. To do this, we must act in three areas: Health, Education and Technology.\nIn the field of Health, this meeting should help create the conditions of universal access to the vaccine against Covid-19 as soon as the remedy is available. From here, WE DEMAND that the vaccine be accessible to all human beings on the planet. The reason for the creation of an organization like this is to measure up to historical challenges such as this one. To achieve this, the role of the World Health Organization is essential, as well as the creation of a global solidarity fund that will serve as a reserve to mitigate the ravages of future pandemics.\nIn the field of schooling, we must share the most positive experiences, including online education, skills training and support investment efforts in educational policies.\nFinally, the UN must be the engine and guide so that the 21st century is truly the century of knowledge thanks to ever advancing communication technologies. Hence, ending the digital divide is one of the urgent priorities for the international community.\nHowever, all development and all progress will be useless if the values enshrined by this Organization in its Universal Declaration of Human Rights are not taken into account. The UN knows that it has the solid commitment of the Dominican Republic to defend these values; to advance towards higher levels of human dignity that promote policies to guarantee equality between men and women, as well as protect children affected by armed conflicts, or at risk of being sold as slaves, prostituted or used for pornography. Appalling realities happening on our planet today, that we have a moral mandate to eradicate once and for all.\nLadies and Gentlemen:\nI bring to this meeting the mandate of the Dominican people to proclaim our nation\u2019s commitment to protecting the environment and to continue supporting the Paris Agreements.\nFurthermore, I believe the time has come to enhance its postulates. In the Security Council, we have advocated that security factors within the Climate Change context be more broadly and in-depth studied, because a natural phenomenon can cause or aggravate any conflict, mainly in highly fragile areas.\nThe occurrence of natural phenomena and extreme climatic events are becoming more frequent and their greater intensity particularly affects the small island developing states. Which forces this Organization to continue on the path of not considering such phenomena as isolated eventualities, but as common and recurrent realities for which we must be ready.\nThe list of threats and complications can scare anyone. However, this organization has demonstrated over three-quarters of a century that, through dialogue and cooperation, any goal can be achieved, no matter how remote it may seem.\nWhoever thinks one can change the world by one\u2019s self is wrong, and whoever does not know how to measure one\u2019s strength to adjust our contribution will also be wrong. Therefore, on behalf of Dominican men and women, I share our deep commitment, purpose and work to provide solutions to the best of our ability. Close to eleven million Dominicans are eager to do their part.\nThe Dominican Republic was in the founding hour of this Organization and, since then, has demonstrated its will and commitment in the concert of nations for the sake of peace, prosperity, equity and global diversity. We are aware of our demographic and economic reality, but our condition will never be an excuse for not contributing the best of ourselves as we have tried to do for 75 years.\nThe UN, as I understand it, is not concerned with diplomacy, but with the future and, as Eleanor Roosevelt said on the day of the solemn proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \u201cthe future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of your dreams \u201d.\nLet us therefore attain a world in peace, diverse, prosperous and sustainable for at least 75 more years.\nThank you very much."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nLet me join others in congratulating you on assuming this high office during the historic 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly. I want to assure you of our fullest support and cooperation in effectively discharging your responsibilities.\nWe also take this opportunity to express our profound appreciation to your predecessor, Professor Tijjani-Muhammad Bande, who demonstrated able leadership in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic which has disrupted the work of this Assembly.\nExcellencies, Mr. President,\nThis session is indeed special not only because we are marking the 75th anniversary of the founding of the UN, but also because we are doing so in the midst of an unprecedented crises. I believe it will allow us to chart the way forward in the post-COVID world. This, of course, can only be achieved if we work together and try to find a collective solution to the myriad of challenges and threats facing humanity and the planet.\nWe all agree that the immediate priority now is, of course, how to recover from the current crisis and rebuild a better tomorrow. We have no guarantee to prevent a similar crisis in the future without creating sustainable, resilient, and inclusive societies. In this connection, accelerating progress towards the SDGs is not a matter of option but an absolute imperative.\nOn our part, we are determined to get back on track and build the necessary momentum for its implementation. It is in this context that we are designing our next Ten Years Perspective Plan, which coincides with the launching of the UN Decade of Action for the SDGs.\nMr. President,\nNo doubt, the pandemic has overwhelmed health systems across the world and crippled the global economy. Many African countries, including Ethiopia, also find themselves facing the risk of becoming even more food insecure. The World Food Programme has already warned, for instance, that the number of acutely food insecure people in our region is likely to increase significantly due to the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic.\nThis coupled with the multiple crises affecting our region, including the massive outbreak of desert locusts and climate change induced extreme weather events, threatens to wipe out the livelihoods of millions of our people. Therefore, we fully support the call by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for a large-scale, coordinated, and comprehensive multilateral response amounting to at least 10% of global GDP and a series of measures to give developing countries the financial firepower they need to weather this storm.\nWhile we are grateful for the international response in support of the continent which provided some relief, we believe that much more still needs to be done to mitigate the medium and long-term impact of the pandemic on our continent.\nMr. President,\nOur objective should not only be to recover and rebuild a better future, but to do so in a green and climate resilient way. There is no stark reminder of the need for urgent action than the devastating impact of climate change that we are witnessing in various parts of the world. Our region is indeed a case in point with climate induced disaster upending the lives of millions of our people.\nWe all must mobilize more than ever to cut global gas emissions over the next decade to meet our targets under the Paris Climate Agreement. On our part, we are fully committed to redoubling our efforts and fulfilling our obligation. Ethiopia is already responding to the call for climate action through the Green Legacy Initiative, which is part of our efforts to build a green and climate resilient economy.\nI would also like to draw your attention to the fact that our largest infrastructural project today \u2014 the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam \u2014 built with our own local resources, contributes to the conservation of water resources, which would otherwise have been lost to evaporation in downstream countries. I want to make it abundantly clear that we have no intention to harm these countries.\nWhat we are essentially doing is to meet our electricity demands from one of the cleanest sources of energy. We cannot afford to continue keeping more than 65 million of our people in the dark. We have indeed been guided by the internationally accepted principle of equitable and reasonable utilization and not causing significant harm in building this Dam.\nOur unwavering commitment to this important principle is clearly encapsulated in the Declaration of Principles, signed by Ethiopia, Egypt, and the Sudan in March 2015. I want to assure that we are steadfast in our commitment to addressing the concerns of downstream countries and reaching a mutually beneficial outcome in the context of the ongoing AU-led process.\nMr. President,\nOur peace, stability and development is closely interlinked with the peace and security of our subregion.\nIt is in this relation that we are encouraged by the formation of the Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity in South Sudan. We hope the South Sudanese political stakeholders will continue to work together in a spirit of collegiality to address outstanding issues and improve the plight of the South Sudanese people who have suffered for far too long.\nWe in the region together with the rest of the international community will continue to lend our support to accompany South Sudan on a path of sustainable peace.\nWe also follow the developments in the Sudan.\nThe transitional government needs all the support it can get from the international community in easing the serious socio-economic difficulties facing the country and fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of the Sudanese people. On the other hand, we remain deeply concerned by the continued attacks perpetrated by Al-Shabaab in Somalia. That is why we all need to continue supporting Somalia in their security endeavor.\nOn our part, Ethiopia remains committed to the path of the reforms we began two and half years ago. Albeit the resistance that comes with any attempts to shift the status quo in favor of social justice, we will pursue Ethiopia\u2019s inevitable track for democratization.\nFinally, Mr. President, seventy-five years after the founding of the UN, we find ourselves at a crossroads. Therefore, we have a unique responsibility to mobilize our collective political will and commitment to overcome the unprecedented challenges we face.\nIn line with the Declaration on the Commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the UN, we hope the Secretary-General will provide us with far-reaching and appropriate recommendations in helping us achieve this objective and we look forward to receiving his report before the end of this session. I thank you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nDistinguished Heads of State and Government,\nMr. Secretary General,\nEsteemed Delegates,\nI greet you with respect on behalf of myself and my Nation.\nI would like to thank Mr. Muhammed-Bande for his successful work at the United Nations during this difficult period.\nI also wholeheartedly congratulate my former colleague, Ambassador Volkan Bozkir, who has taken over the Presidency of the General Assembly.\nAmbassador Bozkir\u2019s election to this post with the support of the overwhelming majority of countries is a sign of his personal qualities as an experienced diplomat and politician, as well as confidence in Turkey.\nAs the first Turkish citizen to undertake the highest-ranking position within the United Nations system, I believe that Ambassador Bozkir will be the voice and conscience of the international community.\nI have no doubts that he will carry out his duty in a fair and transparent manner.\nI wish Mr. Bozkir every success in his duty, which he assumes on such a meaningful date as the 75th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations.\nI think holding the General Assembly under the theme of \u201cFight against COVID-19 and Multilateralism\u201d is the right decision.\nAs Turkey, we stand by our commitments and we are determined to maintain our support in the fight against COVID-19.\nThe pandemic caught the world at a time when it was having difficulties in coping with various challenges.\nGlobalization, rules-based international system and multilateralism, which were already the subject of discussions, are now even more questioned under the impact of the pandemic.\nWhen we look at the picture in front of us, we need to accurately and sincerely evaluate the full and empty parts of the glass.\nIn the empty part of the glass, there is the need of a reform for multilateral organizations, in particular the United Nations.\nWe have seen how ineffective the existing global mechanisms have been during this crisis.\nThis was so much true that it took weeks, even months, for the Security Council, the most fundamental decision-making body of the United Nations, to include the pandemic on its agenda.\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, a scene emerged where countries were left on their own.\nThus, we have once again seen the rightfulness of the \u201cThe World is bigger than Five\u201d thesis, which I have been advocating for years from this rostrum.\nThe fate of humanity cannot be left at the mercy of a limited number of countries.\nIn order to prevent the loss of reputation of international organizations, we must first review our mentality, institutions and rules.\nEffective multilateralism requires effective multilateral institutions.\nWe must rapidly implement comprehensive and meaningful reforms, starting with the restructuring of the Security Council.\nWe must provide the Council with a more effective, democratic, transparent and accountable structure and functioning.\nLikewise, we should also strengthen the General Assembly, which reflects the common conscience of the international community.\nLooking at the full part of the glass, the United Nations preserves its potential to be the turning point in humanity\u2019s quest for peace, justice and prosperity.\nConsidering that we have not yet overcome the pandemic crisis, we should try to use the institutions and mechanisms we have for multilateral cooperation in the most effective way.\nWhere problems are global, local solutions can only save the day.\nInternational solidarity is essential for long-term solutions.\nIn Turkey, since the early days of the outbreak of the crisis, we have called for cooperation in all international platforms.\nWe have been in the forefront of efforts to combat the pandemic in the G-20, the Turkic Council, MIKTA, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and other platforms.\nWe reached out to 146 countries and 7 international organizations that requested medical equipment assistance, with the understanding that \u201cA sure friend is known in unsure times\u201d.\nWith the repatriation operations we carried out, we ensured the return of more than a hundred thousand of our citizens in 141 countries, to their homes.\nWith the same flights, we carried more than 5,500 foreigners from sixty-seven countries to their homes.\nWe did not do all these with the intention of carry in gouta \u201ccorona virus diplomacy\u201d.\nWe did not expect and still do not hope for any compensation from anyone for our aid and repatriation efforts.\nStanding with the victims and the oppressed is in the veins of our Nation and in the essence of our \u201cEnterprising and Humanitarian Foreign Policy\u201d.\nI once again call for the supply of medical equipment and drugs and vaccine development efforts not to be made an issue of competition.\nNo matter which country they are produced in, vaccines to be made ready-for- use should be offered to the common benefit of humanity.\nDear Delegates,\nWith the pandemic, we have once again experienced together how vital elements such as State capacity, effective governance and resilience are.\nBehind Turkey\u2019s success story lies effective governance mechanisms that we have established with the Presidential Government System, a high capacity developed by our infrastructure investments in the area of health, and qualified human resources.\nHowever, the pandemic adversely affected conflict dynamics around the world and increased vulnerabilities.\nWe regret that the United Nations Secretary General\u2019s call for a global humanitarian ceasefire, which we also support, has not produced concrete results.\nAs Turkey, we are looking for ways to eliminate threats to our country and humanity, by taking any kind of initiative if required. The conflict in Syria, which entered its 10th year, continues to pose a threat to the security and stability of our region.\nAs the country that struck the first and most serious blow against DAESH in the region, we continue to fight against the PKK-YPG terrorist organization.\nAs the international community, we cannot find a permanent solution to the Syrian issue without adopting the same principled attitude and decisive stance against all terrorist organizations.\nThis approach is also essential for ensuring safe and voluntary returns to Syria.\nThe return of more than our 411,000 Syrian brothers and sisters to the regions we liberated from terrorist organizations in Syria is the most clear indicator of this.\nLikewise, thanks to the regions we made secure, we succeeded in preventing that millions of Syrians living in different parts of the country, particularly Idlib, left their homeland.\nTurkey hosts approximately 4 million Syrians on its own territory for years by addressing all their needs.\nWe also meet the needs of approximately the same number of Syrians on-site, in the regions that we keep under control, especially in areas close to our border.\nUltimately, we are building tens of thousands of briquette houses in Idlib and elsewhere for our brothers and sisters.\nWe carry out all these activities with our own means and with the support of our people, without a significant support from the international community or international organizations.\nIt should be a priority for all of us to resolve the conflict in Syria on the basis of the roadmap endorsed in the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254 (2015).\nTo this end, the political process initiated under the auspices of the United Nations, which is also Syrian-owned and Syrian-led, should be brought to a successful conclusion.\nThis is the only way that Syria can achieve a lasting peace, while preserving its territorial integrity and political unity.\nUntil this goal is achieved, we are determined to prevent terrorist organizations that intend to pose a threat to our national security, as well as to the political unity and territorial integrity of Syria.\nToday, countries like Turkey, which are hosting the highest number of refugees, save the dignity of all humanity through their sacrifices.\nHowever, some States, including some European countries, unfortunately violate the rights of refugees and asylum-seekers.\nIt is time for the United Nations to take a firm stand against these violations that corrode the Geneva Convention and the international human rights system.\nThe attacks launched by the coup plotters in Libya last year to overthrow the legitimate Government of National Accord have brought only pain and destruction to this country.\nThe international community couldn\u2019t ensure that neither the coup plotters nor their supporters have been made to account for the massacres, human rights violations and especially for the mass graves in Tarhuna.\nTurkey has been the only country to give a concrete response and provide support to the call for help of the legitimate Government of Libya.\nWe believe that a permanent political solution in Libya can be established through an inclusive and comprehensive dialogue conducted by the Libyans.\nIt is also under the responsibility of the international community to stop the bloodshed in Yemen, which has been continuing for more than five years, and stop the humanitarian crisis.\nHistory will not forgive those who covet Yemen\u2019s sovereignty, political unity and territorial integrity with the intention of gaining influence in the region, and those who overlook the continued sufferings of Yemenis.\nIt is our sincere desire that Iraq does not turn into an area of conflict for external powers and reaches a position to produce stability and prosperity for our region.\nWhile we support our neighbor Iraq in every field, we would like to cooperate more closely especially in the fight against terrorism.\nWe expect a genuine cooperation from the international community and Iraq concerning the uprooting of PKK terrorist organization, which has been nested in Iraq, just as it has been the case for DAESH.\n13/01/2021\nClearing the region from terrorist organizations will contribute to the enlightenment of the future of Iraq, which hosts the most ancient geography of humanity.\nWe are in favor of resolving the issues about Iran\u2019s nuclear program by taking into account international law, through diplomacy and dialogue.\nI would like to reiterate our call for all Parties to abide by their obligations under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which significantly contributes to regional and global security.\nThe order of occupation and oppression in Palestine, which is the bleeding wound of humanity, continues to hurt consciences.\nThe dirty hand that reaches the privacy of Jerusalem, where the sacred places of the three great religions coexist, is constantly increasing its audacity.\nThe Palestinian people have stood up against Israel\u2019s policies of oppression, violence, and intimidation for more than half a century.\nUpon rejection of the document of surrender, which was tried to be imposed on Palestine under the name of \u201cDeal of the Century\u201d, Israel this time accelerated its attempts to \u201chave the inside track\u201d with the help of its collaborators.\nTurkey will not support any plan that the Palestinian people do not give consent to.\nParticipation of some countries of the region in this game does not mean anything beyond serving Israel\u2019s efforts to erode basic international parameters.\nCountries that have declared their intention to open Embassies in Jerusalem, in violation of the United Nations resolutions and international law, only serve to make the conflict more complicated with their actions.\nThe Palestinian conflict can only be resolved with the establishment of an independent, sovereign, and contiguous State of Palestine based on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital.\nSeeking solutions other than this are in vain, one-sided, and unjust.\nArmenia, who attacked the Azerbaijani territories in July, has once again proved that it is the biggest obstacle to lasting peace and stability in the South Caucasus.\nWe are in favor of resolving the conflicts in the region as soon as possible, especially the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, in line with the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Azerbaijan and Georgia and resolutions of the United Nations and the OSCE.\nThe Kashmir conflict, which is also key to the stability and peace of South Asia, is still a burning issue.\nSteps taken following the abolition of the special status of Jammu-Kashmir further complicated the problem.\nWe are in favour of solving this issue through dialogue, within the framework of the United Nations resolutions and especially in line with the expectations of the people of Kashmir.\nDistinguished Delegates.\nBehind the tension existing in the Eastern Mediterranean for a while, there are countries acting with the understanding of \u201cthe winner takes it all\u201d.\nThe futile steps to exclude our country have no chance of success.\nWe do not have designs on anyone else\u2019s right, remedy and legitimate interests, neither in the Eastern Mediterranean nor in any other region.\nHowever, we cannot turn a blind eye on the violation of the rights of our country and the Turkish Cypriots and to the fact that our interests are being ignored.\nThe reason for the problems existing in the region today is the one-sided steps taken by Greece and the Greek Cypriots since 2003 with maximalist demands.\nTurkey is a country that is compelled to shoulder the burden of any negative developments in the Eastern Mediterranean by itself.\nOn the other hand, ignoring our country when it comes to the natural resources in the region can be explained neither by wisdom and conscience nor by international law.\nOur priority is to settle disputes in a sincere dialogue, based on international law and on an equitable basis.\nHowever, I would like to clearly state that we will never tolerate any imposition, harassment, or attack in the opposite direction.\nI would like to repeat here our call for establishing dialogue and cooperation between coastal countries of the Eastern Mediterranean.\nFor this purpose, we would like to propose the convening of a regional Conference, including Turkish Cypriots, in which the rights and interests of all the countries of the region are considered.\nOne of the reasons for the crisis in the region is the absence of a fair, comprehensive, and permanent solution to the Cyprus issue during the negotiations that have been continuing intermittently since 1968.\nThe only obstacle to a solution is the uncompromising, unjust and spoiled approach of the Greek Cypriot side.\nIgnoring international agreements, the Greek Cypriot side aims to make the Turkish Cypriots a minority in their homeland, or even completely exclude them from the island.\nAs a guarantor country, we have never left the Turkish Cypriot people alone in their rightful cause, and we will not leave them in the future.\nThe solution to the Cyprus issue is possible only by accepting the fact that the Turkish Cypriot people are the co-owners of the island.\nWe will support any solution that will permanently guarantee the security of the Turkish Cypriot people and their historical and political rights on the island.\nDistinguished Delegates,\nThis year marks the 75th anniversary of the atomic bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\nDisarmament is of vital importance for ensuring global peace and security.\nIn contrast, the architecture of arms control has suffered significant damage in recent years.\nThe international community must move forward on the basis of equality and justice in this regard, eliminating all weapons of mass destruction.\nAnother important issue where we have an obligation to act together is climate change.\nWe see how human interference in the balance of nature can lead to heavy costs.\nWe must stop and reverse this bad course.\nAs Turkey, we sincerely support the efforts in this struggle and fulfil our obligations, even though we have an almost negligible historical responsibility at this point.\nIn the recent past, we hosted the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.\nWe have conducted fruitful cooperation with many regions and countries, especially in Africa.\nWe also undertook to host the 16th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity to be held in 2022.\nAnd now, I want to draw your attention to a problem that threatens humanity, but for some reason is considered invisible.\nRacism, xenophobia, Islamophobia and hate speech have reached an alarming level.\nIn the course of the pandemic, acts of violence against vulnerable people, especially migrants and asylum-seekers, accelerated while xenophobia and racism increased.\nMuslims are the most exposed to these dangerous tendencies fueled by prejudice and ignorance.\nThose who are primarily responsible for this dangerous course are politicians who turn to populist rhetoric for the sake of votes, and marginal segments who legitimize hate speech by abusing the freedom of expression.\nI urgently call on all international organizations to take more concrete steps in the fight against this mentality.\nI reiterate my call for March 15, the day of the terrorist attack perpetrated in New Zealand against Muslims, to be declared by the United Nations as \u201cInternational Solidarity Day Against Islamophobia\u201d.\nAs the second largest international organization after the United Nations, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation has officially recognized this day.\nThe pandemic and the escalating economic crisis associated with it also have negative effects on sustainable development, and on the 2030 goals.\nDeveloping countries and low-income countries are more affected by this crisis.\nIn fact, what happened during the pandemic has shown us that Sustainable Development Goals can be an important guide in combating all kinds of global crises.\nWe should also use the transformative power of digitalization in preparing economic prescriptions to survive the crisis.\nWe support the United Nations Secretary General\u2019s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation.\nWe also set the theme of the first \u201cAntalya Diplomacy Forum\u201d, which we have designed to address global and regional issues, as \u201cdiplomacy in the digital age\u201d.\nWe also host the United Nations Technology Bank for the Least Developed Countries.\nBeing the easternmost European and the westernmost Asian increases Turkey\u2019s specific weight in all areas.\nWith our \u201cAsia Anew\u201d initiative, we will give our relations a new dynamism, in our current time when the pendulum of history is shifting again towards Asia.\nWe have also gained significant momentum in our relations with Africa, with which we have humanitarian and historical ties connecting our close geographies.\nWe plan to implement projects aimed at strengthening Africa\u2019s capacity at the third Turkey-African Union Partnership Summit that we intend to hold in Turkey next year.\nAs I conclude my remarks, I would like to say that our strong support for multilateralism will continue during this sensitive period we are passing through.\nWe must of course keep our distance from the pandemic, but we must also close ranks in our joint struggle and cooperation against all challenges that threaten the international community.\nWe will continue our efforts to transform Istanbul, one of the most prominent cities in the world throughout history, into a regional hub of the United Nations.\nI wish success to the 75th General Assembly\u2019s work.\nI greet you with respect on behalf of myself and my Nation.\nI wish you the best of health."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nMr. Secretary-General,\nExcellencies,\nDistinguished guests,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nI bring you warm greetings from our beautiful island nation. I am grateful for the privilege to appear before this historical 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly as President of the Federated States of Micronesia.\nFirst, Mr. President, congratulations on your election to head this 75th Session of the General Assembly. Your experience and high standing have made you an ideal choice to provide the critical leadership needed for this position.\nI also wish to express my appreciation and recognition to our distinguished Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres. Every day the Secretary-General provides diligent service to this Organization. Despite today\u2019s great challenges, the United Nations has emerged as a stronger and more dynamic Organization than at any time since its founding 75 years ago. Micronesia is grateful to the Secretary-General\u2019s unstinting and selfless devotion to the work of this Organization and his unflinching pursuit of the principle of \u201cleaving no one behind.\u201d\nMr. President,\nI begin by paying my respects to the memory of those who have lost their lives due to the COVID-19 Pandemic and other tragedies this year, from the explosion in Beirut and the fires in Australia, to the hurricanes in the United States and cyclones in India and Bangladesh. Micronesia extends peace, friendship, cooperation, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 love in our common humanity to all peoples and Nations. We stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters across the World. All human life is priceless and valuable. Empathy is not weakness. Empathy is courage, and empathy is strength. Through empathy, our global community can overcome any challenge, from COVID-19 to Climate Change.\nIt is crucial, in both times of peace as well as times of calamity, that the international community stand together. An infringement on the rights of one is the same as an infringement on the rights of us all.\nWhether we call it multilateralism, inclusivity, or simple human decency, we are much more alike than we are different. All human life matters, and our Nation calls upon the global community to embrace solidarity with one another.\nOn the eve of the 75th anniversary of the UNGA, I note that Micronesia itself is a product of multilateralism. Micronesia emerged into nationhood after decades of being a part of the former Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, which was created as a strategic trusteeship after the Second World War. We are soon to celebrate our 34th anniversary of Independence.\nOur nation has an Enduring Partnership with the United States of America as codified through our Compact of Free Association, which sets forth important reciprocal agreements between our two nations and a framework for U.S. assistance in our country\u2019s efforts to self-sufficiency. Micronesia has many other crucial friendships including with Japan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Australia, and many others, all of which have also helped our country, which is remote and in need of international assistance.\nMicronesia is a peace-loving country, and we have demonstrated that peace is as possible as it is desirable.\nMr. President,\nThe Federated States of Micronesia is fortunate and grateful to have an Enduring Partnership with the United States of America, and a Great Friendship with the Peoples Republic of China. I continue to maintain, on behalf of my country, that consistent cooperation amongst ALL nations and peoples is critical to global solidarity. Whether it is the global fight against COVID-19 or Climate Change, or our international efforts to tackle human trafficking and illegal fishing, the Federated States of Micronesia asks our American and Chinese friends to reinforce their cooperation and friendship with each other, in order to achieve what is best for our global community.\nALL of us are acutely aware of the renewed, and increasing intensity of competition for access and influence in our Pacific Region. There is little doubt that these activities and efforts have resulted in varying levels of benefits for our Pacific communities; however, they also potentially threaten to fracture long standing alliances within our Pacific Family, and could become counterproductive to our collective desire for Regional solidarity, security, and stability. I call on my fellow Pacific Island Leaders, AND the leadership and citizens of our neighboring Developed and Industrialized Pacific Nations, to remain focused and true to the \u201ccollective goals\u201d that UNITE us, and not unilateral interests that may surely DIVIDE us in the long term.\nMy country is committed to doing its part as a sovereign Nation of this organization, to advance the principles of liberty, equality, democracy, the rule of law, and RESPECT for our fellow global citizens.\nIt is my hope, as the President of the Federated States of Micronesia, that the United States of America and the People\u2019s Republic of China JOINTLY champion global causes for global solidarity and cooperation, from Climate Change to COVID-19.\nMr. President,\nThe Federated States of Micronesia is keenly aware that, like all nations of the World, it is simultaneously facing the public health threat of COVID-19, and the longer-term existential threat of Climate Change. Solutions to these two crises require international collaboration.\nFor our vulnerable Nation, COVID-19 is an immediate security threat. While we remain one of very few COVID-19 free countries in the world, we have found through our infrastructure assessments and repatriation simulation exercises that we need to address gaps and weaknesses. Stopping the potential spread of COVID-19 into our country, with the widespread suffering that would result, is our highest priority.\nOur Nation appreciates the assistance of the UN system, the World Health Organization, and so many generous countries in helping us combat the COVID-19 threat. This disease is of global consequence and can only be addressed through global cooperation, such as we have seen for polio and other diseases. Through global cooperation, COVID-19 can be defeated as well.\nMicronesia passionately believes that Sustainable Development Goal #17 \u2014 Partnerships \u2014 is the bedrock upon which all other SDGs can be met. Because all human lives have value and because empathy is strength, once effective vaccines for COVID-19 are developed, Micronesia hopes that they will be shared widely and immediately \u2014 accessible and affordable \u2014 with all nations and peoples of the world to save human lives.\nMr. President,\nFor our Nation, Climate Change is our single greatest long-term security threat. Rising waters threaten to make life in remote atolls impossible. Higher temperatures threaten crops, livestock, and fish.\nAll countries and peoples are in a global war against Climate Change. We have witnessed deadly fires in the US, typhoons in the Caribbean and in the Pacific, and floods in Asia. It is a war that we can win, but we must be much more aggressive in combatting it.\nThe world must transition to sustainable and renewable energy. Coal and natural gas are unsustainable solutions for the environment and are harmful to both economic growth and equality of opportunity. If our World is to fulfill its commitments under the Paris Agreement, all nations must make a unified and global effort. We have seen, through the Montreal Protocol, that 98 per cent of Ozone Depleting Substances have been phased out by the global community. We can succeed if we work together. It is both possible and essential to improve our quality of life while also being responsible stewards of our Planet.\nFor our part in the Federated States of Micronesia, Vice President George and I have submitted proposed legislation to our National Congress that would make renewable energy part of our petroleum corporation\u2019s mandate.\nMr. President,\nTo repeat myself: the solutions to both Climate Change and COVID-19 is global solidarity and cooperation. Just as we call upon the Security Council to take Climate Change seriously, we believe that the Security Council must view COVID-19 as a global security threat as well.\nWith respect to the Security Council, one way for the Security Council to succeed is to ensure that its mandates are comprehensive to address new and urgent crises. We believe that the UN Secretary-General ought to appoint a Special Representative for Climate and Security under the Security Council, and that UN efforts should become more inclusive. This belief is reinforced by the Leaders of the Pacific Island Forum, most recently in 2019\u2019s Kainaki II Declaration.\nIn a global community where all lives have value and all voices are equal, it is crucial that the Security Council\u2019s membership include a broader spectrum of greater UN membership, and that the number of permanent members be expanded. Japan, with whom we share a Kizuna or special bond, and Germany \u2014 both of whom at one point controlled our islands \u2014 are countries that know the importance of multilateralism. In the 75 years since the end of the Second World War, they have dedicated themselves to peace, friendship, cooperation, and love with all peoples and nations. It is Micronesia\u2019s view that Japan, Germany, India, and Brazil ought to become permanent members of the Security Council.\nMr. President,\nMicronesia is of course a Big Ocean State. The ocean is the main source of our sustenance and a major part of our economy. A large portion of our export revenues come from ocean and coastal-based activities such as in fisheries and related services.\nOur exposure to the Pacific Ocean carries risks beyond climate change. According to a report by the World Economic Forum, by 2050 there may be more plastics than fish in our oceans. This February I signed legislation into public law which bans the importation of Styrofoam and one-time-use plastics into Micronesia. Over the next five years, Micronesia is partnering with the Blue Prosperity Coalition to seek to protect 30% of our ocean\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone by 2030.\nMicronesia is thus taking actions today for our ocean\u2019s prosperity tomorrow. I urge all peoples and nations to join our efforts. We cannot allow COVID-19 to halt efforts such as the Post-2020 Biodiversity Framework or the intergovernmental negotiations on the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) instrumentation.\nMicronesia welcomes the work being done by the International Law Commission on the topic of \u201cSealevel rise in relation to international law\u201d, including the first issues paper released by two of the CoChairs of the Commission\u2019s Study Group, in which they focus on the Law of the Sea elements of the topic. These include the legal implications of sea-level rise for maritime baselines, maritime zones, maritime delimitation, and the status of islands.\nThe Pacific Islands Forum has been instrumental in pushing the international community to address sealevel rise, building on the longstanding work in the Pacific region to delineate all of our maritime zones in accordance with the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Micronesia strongly encourages the Commission to advance its work on this important topic in a comprehensive and expeditious manner.\nMicronesia strongly believes that rising sea levels should not undermine our country\u2019s maritime baselines and maritime zones. We recently deposited with the UN Secretary-General our maritime charts and lists of geographical coordinates of points identifying these baselines and zones, as required by the UNCLOS. We included with our deposit written observations that Micronesia is not obligated under international law to keep our maritime zones under review and would maintain those zones regardless of climate change-induced sea-level rise. To our knowledge, this is the first example of such observations to ever be included with such deposits. This recognizes that Micronesia\u2019s legal entitlements to the richness of the resources and biodiversity of our maritime spaces must not be reduced under international law because of a phenomenon \u2014 i.e., climate change-induced sea-level rise \u2014 for which Micronesia has minimal responsibility. Any other result would be a gross legal and moral injustice.\nMicronesia encourages other States to consider making similar observations with their deposits.\nMr. President,\nMicronesia joins its immediate neighbors, the Republic of Palau, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Nauru, and the Republic of Kiribati, in celebrating the actions of the ECOSOC and the General Assembly to establish a UN Multi-Country Office in the North Pacific.\nIt has taken over 15 years for us to achieve this result. With challenges of a global scale affecting island nations like ours in the Pacific, a UN presence on the ground will be extremely helpful. This important decision reflects the UN\u2019s commitment to address the concerns of even the most vulnerable and smallest of its members. Micronesia is proud to become the host for this office, and extends its gratitude to both the United Nations at large as well as its brothers and sisters in the North Pacific for their support.\nMr. President,\nThe Federated States of Micronesia recognizes Secretary-General Guterres\u2019 road map for digital cooperation and the gaps made clear by the COVID-19 Pandemic. A digital inter-dependent World has the potential to advance our social and economic aspirations or leave many of us behind.\nThrough assistance provided from partners such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the United Nations, and the United States of America, Micronesia is hoping to build an inclusive digital economy, develop human and institutional capacity, protect human rights, promote digital trust, and foster global digital cooperation. I am hopeful that global digital cooperation can help us combat evils such as human trafficking, illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing, and promote positive efforts such as online education and tele-health programming.\nThere is much work that needs to be done in this area, and the challenges are immense. While we are working hard to democratize knowledge through making internet and cellphone access more accessible and more affordable, there remain significant technical and capacity gaps. Micronesia wishes to strengthen existing partnerships, and develop new ones, in its effort to build a digital future.\nMr. President,\nA better world is not something we ask for. A better world is something we build. We define a better world through consensus, with a foundation of empathy and love for other human beings. We construct a better world by acknowledging that we are who we choose to be, and then choosing to take responsibility for both ourselves and our communities.\nFor the small nations of the world, the United Nations today is more important than ever.\nThank you, Mr. President."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, Excellencies, alii from the Republic of Palau.\nPlease allow me to begin by congratulating His Excellency Volkan Bozkir on his election as President of this historic 75th session of the General Assembly. I also wish to express Palau\u2019s thanks to His Excellency Tijjani Muhammad-Bande for his leadership of the Assembly over the past year, guiding us through these unprecedented challenges.\nMr. President,\nSome nineteen years ago, I had the privilege of addressing this Assembly for the first time as President of the Republic of Palau. In January, I will complete my public service, having served as President for sixteen of those years, and I will return to being a fisherman in Palau\u2019s pristine waters. In my final address to the General Assembly today, I want to reflect on the difference these last two decades have made, and on the many benefits Palau has enjoyed from its relationship with the United Nations.\nWhen I addressed the 52nd session of the General Assembly, we were meeting two months after the horror of the 9/11 attacks. My message then was one of unity, of recognizing a new spirit of cooperation that globalization was fostering in response to 9/11.1 said then:\n\u201cWhile we remain shocked, saddened and deeply offended by the events giving rise to the new unity, we must acknowledge and nurture whatever good those events can be turned to. We now have the ability to see the clear advantages of close cooperation on matters which affect us all.\u201d\nIn a way, this call remains apt today. We meet not in the shadow of terrorism, but in the shadow of global pandemic. We do not see human evil in this pandemic, in the way we did in the perpetrators of 9/11. But the challenge of our response is not so different: to craft closer cooperation between nations large and small, rich and poor; to unite in the face of a shared crisis in a way that might have seemed unlikely a year or two ago.\nIn 2001,1 emphasized that:\n\u201cThere is only one system in which we exist, and the related understanding that any act or condition within that system affects each of us, although in varying ways and degrees. In such a system, problems are best addressed through coalition-building and a consensus driven approach, and process of give and take, involving the widest possible range of participants.\u201d\nThis is no less true today than it was in 2001. We took up many opportunities for coalition-building after 9/11: on terrorism, on the Millennium Development Goals and on advancing the doctrine of the responsibility to protect. Other challenges remain and have intensified, especially those challenges to the health of our planet.\nOur method in addressing this ecological crisis must also be to turn towards coalitionbuilding, a consensus-driven approach and to form new partnerships for enhancing ambition and effective implementation. We must act in solidarity with each other because it is a shared future that we face together, which we cannot address if we are divided.\nOur immediate shared future is, of course, the pandemic, and I wish to extend our condolences at the loss of life suffered by so many around the world to this virus.\nIn Palau, we have been fortunate to remain free of COVID-19 cases. But we are certainly not free of the consequences of this pandemic. Sometimes we hear people say that health is more important than money, and that is certainly true. But a national economy is not \u201cmoney,\u201d it is the system that determines quality of life, and that delivers critical public services. It is the environment, healthcare, education. It is food on the table.\nThis pandemic has put Palau into a level of isolation we have not known for many, many years. We struggle with disruptions to supply chains for food and essential medicines. We struggle to connect patients with life-saving medical treatment, for which we previously relied on off-island providers in larger countries. We struggle to keep families united, to keep college students in school, and to keep family breadwinners working. Private sector unemployment is approaching 50%, and it will take years to recover what we have lost in months.\nThis pandemic highlights a feature of multilateral development we have been pointing out for many years now. The truth is, Palau\u2019s high-income categorization is, in many ways, unrealistic. It does not match the facts on the ground or reflect our tremendous vulnerability as a small economy. This has to be addressed, because the current rules deny us help we desperately need. The unified response from the international community should extend to our small island circumstances. This means access to concessional finance and to innovative financial support, so that we too can prepare to recover from the economic crisis that the pandemic has brought. To rebuild the fiscal space for investing in sustainable development that the pandemic has wiped out.\nWe know that this pandemic is far from over. And small States cannot also be left out in the race to seek an effective vaccine. In a global community, parts of the world cannot be made safe in isolation. Vaccine hoarding will harm us all. Palau\u2019s recovery from the economic crisis of COVID will not be possible without sharing in this process to develop a vaccine. As a result, Palau will be participating in the COVAX Facility being coordinated by GAVI and partners, as our best shot to pooling resources and supporting equitable access to a vaccine, if and when one becomes available. Meanwhile, we will also continue to work with our close friends in the United States, in close partnership with the US Centers for Disease Control.\nWe cannot let this individual threat distract us from the long-term threats we continue to face. Our long-term health, development and prosperity depend on repairing our relationship with nature. This is especially the case in responding to our ocean emergency. Marine pollution, overfishing and acidifying and warming seas are taking their toll on the health of our ocean. And our human prosperity depends on a healthy ocean.\nAt the beginning of this year, Palau reached a new milestone by implementing the Palau National Marine Sanctuary. We are protecting 80% of our Exclusive Economic Zone as a no take protected area, echoing our ancient tradition of a \u201cbul\u201d, a moratorium on fishing in order to sustain fisheries for the long-term. And we will be developing an artisanal domestic fishing sector in the other 20% of our EEZ, to diversify our economy, sustain jobs and improve access to healthy seafood.\nPalau is a large ocean state, and we are acting in accordance with our responsibilities for stewardship over our EEZ. But the ocean covers the majority of our planet\u2019s surface. We hope that Palau\u2019s actions will inspire ambition elsewhere. We are all ocean people, even if we do not live near coasts. All of humanity depends on the ocean for food, for climate regulation, for trade, for security, and for so much more.\nThe High-Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, which I co-chair, has been building a blueprint for this ocean ambition. While the Panel\u2019s work has been underway long prior to the pandemic, its analysis highlights how investments in key ocean economy sectors provide a way to \u201cbuild back bluer\u201d from the pandemic, with benefits for jobs, the environment, and human health. These include protecting coastal and marine ecosystems such as mangroves; investing in sewage and wastewater infrastructure for coastal communities, and in zero emission marine transport.\nAt the end of this year, the Ocean Panel will launch our recommendations on transformative actions that we need to take to transition to a sustainable ocean economy. We cannot let this opportunity to rebalance production and ocean protection escape us.\nTo complement these actions, it is also vital that negotiations on a high seas treaty are completed next year. We need to close this governance gap on the high seas, so that we are able to effectively protect the ocean beyond national jurisdiction.\nAdditionally, at next year\u2019s Convention on Biological Diversity COP15, the ocean must also not be neglected. The Global Biodiversity Outlook released last week starkly warns that we have not been successful in reaching the targets set forward a decade ago in Aichi. Significant implementation gaps remain. As we set a new framework for the conservation of nature over the next decade, we need to act with greater urgency, and with greater solidarity for implementation of these targets in developing countries.\nAt least 30% of the ocean needs to be protected by 2030. The role of coral reefs also needs to be appropriately recognized. But for this framework to be effective, it must learn the lessons of the past decade: that goals must be supported by adequate resources.\nWhile the climate COP26 may also have been delayed by the pandemic, this cannot delay increased climate ambition, and support for the implementation of increased ambition. Responding to the climate emergency is of existential concern, and the momentary drop in emissions this year cannot be allowed to generate any complacency about global progress. The climate finance commitments made by developed countries cannot be shirked during this pandemic, because to do so is to undermine the ability of the most vulnerable to mitigate and adapt to climate impacts. The Green Climate Fund needs to continue its work on simplified access for the most vulnerable, such as small island developing states.\nIn Palau, our preparations to reach our NDC target of 45% renewable energy generation are progressing. Solar power and a supporting microgrid will soon reduce our miniscule emissions, but also serve as a form of adaptation, increase our energy security and resilience, and reduce the volatilities of imported fossil fuels. With the right support in implementation, we can go further in bringing forward an enhanced NDC before COP26. We are ready for the energy transition in Palau. But we need the right partnerships to deliver on our ambition.\nAs the current impacts of the climate emergency worsen, they are generating more security threats to vulnerable countries, especially small island states. We welcome Germany\u2019s initiative to convene a Security Council debate on the climate emergency this year. We reiterate the call of the Pacific island states for the appointment of a Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Climate and Security to integrate these concerns into the Council\u2019s agenda.\nTime and time again, Palau has emphasized the need for effective partnerships to support sustainable development. This is especially true as we begin the Decade of Action to deliver the SDGs, and it is the unique role of the United Nations to facilitate these partnerships. Our guiding frameworks, such as the SAMOA Pathway have already been agreed. What is needed is the support for implementation.\nIn Palau, a tangible expression of this support is in the partnerships with multiple friends for infrastructure development in our \u201cGlobal Village\u201d conference facilities in Koror. These facilities have been progressively upgraded over the past year, in partnership with UNOPS, and which I will officially open next week. Durable, quality infrastructure is a cornerstone of sustainable development. While Palau is an island, the partnerships that have made this Global Village possible remind us about the solidarity shown by friends all over the world.\nSince my first address to the General Assembly as President in 2001, I have reiterated Palau\u2019s call for Taiwan to be allowed to participate in international organizations. We regret that this was denied again at this year\u2019s World Health Assembly. At the very moment when the world needed to come together to respond to the pandemic, we failed to do so. And I do mean that we failed. Taiwan, a public health leader that has implemented one of world\u2019s most effective pandemic responses, was left out of the global response to this pandemic, and that made the world less safe.\nIn this pandemic, Taiwan has generously shared its experience and expertise with Palau, including critical support for establishing on-island testing capabilities, and PPE procurement. The effectiveness of Taiwan\u2019s control over the pandemic has been recognized by many others, and if included in international health coordination mechanisms, can also share these lessons with the rest of the world. As such, Taiwan is one of the only places on earth that is safe enough for quarantine-free travel with COVID-free nations like Palau. And we are currently working together to create the world\u2019s first safe bubble economy.\nOn many other international issues and organizations, such as in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the International Civil Aviation Organization, Taiwan can also make meaningful contributions to strengthening collective action. Taiwanese residents and journalists have been unjustly barred from accessing UN premises, limiting their ability to engage with the UN\u2019s agenda and work. We urge others in this Assembly to join us in recognizing that Taiwan Can Help in responding to so many of our shared challenges. This includes in implementing the 2030 Agenda, where we often underline the need to leave no-one behind. The 23.5 million people of Taiwan should not be left behind, and it is time for Taiwan\u2019s exclusion to end.\nPalau, of course, holds a special relationship with the United States. Palau\u2019s bond with the United States is written in its Compact of Free Association, but it is written even more deeply in shared history, shared culture, and common values. We share the American priorities and values of freedom, democracy, individual rights, and a rules-based international order. In these turbulent times, we share its firm commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, which we reaffirmed by hosting the US Secretary of Defense last month. We seek new opportunities to deepen this relationship for mutual benefit, including for the purposes of regional security and diversifying our economic activities.\nThe enduring friendship of Palau and the United States is an advertisement for the rules based-international order. In a rules-based international order, states of all sizes, all cultures, and all regions can thrive together.\nThis commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific region is also shared with Japan, which has been a historic partner, and a historic development partner, of Palau. Japan\u2019s technical assistance to Palau, especially in infrastructure development, reaches every corner of Palau, and we look forward to this continuing under their new government. I want to express a personal note of thanks to Prime Minister Abe, who has been a consistent friend of Palau and our region, and to wish him a healthy recovery. Japan\u2019s ocean initiatives, especially on marine plastic litter, also show a commitment to transitioning towards a sustainable ocean economy.\nWe were delighted to welcome Australia\u2019s first resident Ambassador to Palau earlier this year. Now, as I speak, Australia\u2019s commitment to regional security is being demonstrated through the training and handover of the PSS Remeliik II, a new contribution to our coast guard as part of Australia\u2019s Pacific Maritime Security Program.\nIn the past few years, South-South cooperation has also taken on increased importance for Palau. In particular, the Government of India, through the India-UN Development Partnership Fund, and in partnership with the UN Office for South- South Cooperation and UNOPS, has provided invaluable support to improving our healthcare system, as well as a rapid response to pandemic preparations.\nOur Global South partners continue to expand, with a new award to Palau from India, Brazil and South Africa\u2019s Poverty Reduction Facility, to support the revitalization of education facilities. This solidarity between some of the world\u2019s largest states, and Palau, one of the world\u2019s smallest, is a powerful demonstration of a commitment towards the UN\u2019s values and the vision of the 2030 Agenda.\nMr. President,\nAs one of the youngest members of this organization since we gained our independence in 1994, Palau\u2019s lived experience tells us about the importance of multilateralism. In this 75th anniversary year of the United Nations, we know that this multilateralism is fragile, precious, and must be actively defended. All have a part to play in it, and no-one can opt-out if we are to all benefit from it.\nAs the leader of a small state, I am proud of Palau\u2019s contribution to the United Nations and our multilateral agenda. To building consensus around shared norms, and to actively participating in our shared institutions. We were among the first countries to ratify the Paris Agreement and the Nuclear Ban Treaty, after actively contributing to their negotiation. We were champions of a standalone goal on oceans in the 2030 Agenda, and of including tobacco control among the targets for Goal 4 on health. We have emphasized the critical value of partnerships for sustainable development and peace. The sovereign equality that each of us exercise in this Assembly is a responsibility that we take seriously. And I hope that you will agree that Palau has lived up to this responsibility.\nThis has been my final contribution to our annual General Debate. But be in no doubt that Palau\u2019s contributions to the work of the UN is just beginning.\nThank you, and Kom kmal mesulang."

        "file_text": "Your Excellency Volkan Bozkir, President of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly,\nYour Excellency Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nI would like to congratulate Your Excellency Volkan Bozkir upon your election as the President of the 75th United Nations General Assembly. I am fully confident that under your experienced and able leadership, our session will be a success.\nLet me also voice my appreciation for the important contributions that His Excellency Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, President of the 74th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, and Secretary-General Antonio Guterres have made despite the tremendous challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMr. President,\nWe are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the United Nations and entering the third decade of the 21st century in extraordinary circumstances.\nFor the first time in history, the Leaders of Member States are unable to gather at the UNGA General Debate . This, however, does not diminish our resolve and ability to deliberate and seek solutions for issues of common concern.\nI echo the Secretary-General\u2019s assessment that we are facing the most formidable challenges since the birth of the UN, in particular, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy, society, politics and, most of all, human life.\nMr. President,\nAgainst this backdrop, I welcome the theme of our Session: \u201cThe Future We Want, the UN We Need: Reaffirming our Collective Commitment to Multilateralism\u2014 confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action\u201d. Allow me to share some of my thoughts along that line.\nFirst, global and regional multilateral mechanisms must be strengthened. We need a United Nations that is truly cohesive and inclusive, where every member, large or small, rich or poor, can have a voice in deciding matters of common concern. The UN must serve as the \u201cincubator\u201d for multilateral cooperation initiatives for peace, development and prosperity. Further reforms should be undertaken to transform the UN into a stronger and more effective organization that can fulfill its role of harmonizing the interests and behaviors of states in the face of the monumental changes of our time.\nSecond, the United Nations Charter and the fundamental principles of international law must be upheld and advanced as the norms of behavior for all countries in contemporary international relations. We must be resolute and perseverant in advancing cooperation and friendship to counter conflict and hostility. We must choose dialogue over confrontation, and peaceful settlement of disputes over unilateral acts of imposition. In this spirit, Viet Nam calls for the removal of unilateral sanctions that adversely affect countries\u2019 socio-economic development and people\u2019s livelihoods, especially the embargo imposed upon Cuba.\nThird, the COVID-19 pandemic serves as a stern warning to us all, requiring our stronger commitments and stronger actions to promote sustainable, inclusive and human-centered development. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development should continue to be the framework for our cooperation to overcome this pandemic for sustainable recovery. Our policies and actions should have the interest of our people at the heart, so that no one, and no country, will be left behind. Developing countries should receive financial assistance, technological and commercial facilitation to realize the Sustainable Development Goals.\nMr. President,\nSeventy-five years ago, on 2 September 1945, President Ho Chi Minh delivered the Declaration of Independence that proclaimed the birth of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam (now the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam). Since those early days, President Ho Chi Minh, on multiple occasions, sent letters to the founding members of the UN, expressing Viet Nam\u2019s desire to become a member of the Organization. While it was not until 1977 that this aspiration became reality, the long and tenacious struggle of Viet Nam to win and defend national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity served as a concrete contribution to the worldwide movement for peace, democracy and social progress \u2014 ultimately the same noble goals to which the UN aspires. Let me take this occasion, on behalf of the Vietnamese people, to express our deepest gratitude to countries and international friends for your generous support towards our past righteous struggle for national independence and present national development.\nViet Nam was once a poor and backward country ravaged by war, strangled by embargo. After thirty-five years of Doi Moi reform, Viet Nam has emerged as a middle-income developing country and is aiming to be a high-income industrial country by 2045. In the fight against COVID-19, difficulties notwithstanding, Viet Nam has recorded positive and noteworthy outcomes. We have successfully contained the pandemic while promoting social and economic development. Out of international solidarity and with the understanding that the pandemic is only defeated when we all win, Viet Nam has engaged in cooperation and experience sharing with many countries, including support provided to those worst affected by the pandemic and to the common international efforts.\nViet Nam pursues a foreign policy of independence, self-reliance, multilateralization and diversification of relations. As a reliable partner and an active, responsible member of the international community, Viet Nam attaches importance to the work of the UN and has been expanding our comprehensive cooperation with the Organization. Viet Nam will work with member states to make the UN more democratic, transparent and effective.\nAs a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the term 2020-2021, Viet Nam promotes dialogue, de-escalation of tension and confrontation, and fair and reasonable solutions to regional and global peace and security issues. We champion multilateralism and the respect for international law and the UN Charter, and strengthen relations between the UN and regional organizations, especially ASEAN.\nAs the 2020 ASEAN Chair, Viet Nam is working with fellow member states to build a region of peace, friendship and cooperation, in order to realize the vision of ASEAN as a politically cohesive, economically integrated and socially responsible community. Together with countries within and outside the region, we are committed to the maintenance and promotion of peace, stability, maritime security and safety and freedom of navigation in the East Sea (South China Sea), in accordance with international law, particularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We call on all concerned parties to exercise restraint, avoid unilateral acts that would complicate the situation, and settle disputes and differences through peaceful means with due respect for diplomatic and legal processes.\nMr. President,\nOver the last 75 years, member states have painstakingly built a United Nations for peace, cooperation and development. We are duty-bound to strengthen and reinvigorate the world\u2019s largest multilateral organization, particularly in face of the immense challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.\nThank you for your kind attention."

        "file_text": "Your Excellency Mr. Volkan Bozkir, President of the United Nations General Assembly at its seventy-fifth session,\nYour Excellencies, Heads of State and Government,\nMajesties,\nMr. Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations,\nDear colleagues, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, all protocol observed,\nAt the outset, I would like first and foremost to thank Almighty God, who has enabled us to come together to debate the issues that are dear to our hearts on behalf of humankind.\nOf course, we would have liked this debate, which coincides with the seventy-fifth anniversary of the creation of our Organization, to take place in the General Assembly Hall as is customary, but alas \u2014 the COVID-19 pandemic, which has hit all the nations of the world head-on, requires us to meet virtually.\nWe express our hope that the next sessions will be held under better circumstances, once we have overcome this health crisis that spares no one.\nAllow me, then, to express my warm congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Volkan Bozkir of the Republic of Turkey on his brilliant election as President of the United Nations General Assembly at its seventy-fifth session.\nHis great qualities and talents are certainly a guarantee for the success of the work of this session. Indeed, the central theme of this year\u2019s General Assembly has been well thought-out, namely \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism \u2014 confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action\u201d.\nNaturally, you can count on Burundi\u2019s full cooperation in the accomplishment of your noble and exhilarating mission.\nAt the same time, I would like to pay a well-deserved tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, not only for his admirable professional and personal qualities, but also for the exceptionally professional manner in which he presided over the seventy-fourth session, which we have just successfully concluded in a particularly difficult context marked by the COVID-19 crisis.\nI take this opportunity to present, on behalf of the Burundian people, my deepest condolences and solidarity to the nations that have lost citizens as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This indiscriminate pandemic has highlighted the importance of multilateralism, international solidarity and cooperation in the management of global crises and paradoxes.\nFurthermore, allow me to commend the remarkable work of the Secretary- General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, and his ongoing courageous action to reform our common Organization in order to increase its efficiency and credibility and bring it closer to the citizens of the world, without any discrimination. Burundi reiterates its full support and cooperation in that regard.\nMr. President, in terms of domestic policy, Burundi is well advanced in its process of consolidating peace and democracy, despite the challenges facing my country.\nIndeed, Burundi held general elections between May and August. All of those elections were fair, free, democratic, transparent, peaceful and financed entirely by Burundian taxpayers\u2019 own resources.\nThe full financing of the electoral process from national resources is a testimony to the will of the Burundian people to definitively take ownership of the political, administrative and economic governance system of our country without external interference.\nNow that all the foundations for a strengthened democracy are in place, all that remains is to get down to the work of development \u2014 the linchpin in the fight against poverty.\nWe are aware that this struggle will require wisdom, bravery, courage, perseverance and a high sense of patriotism and love of work. Together, in unity, we will succeed.\nWith regard to the security situation, I am pleased to inform you that the situation in Burundi is stable, calm and fully under control throughout the country.\nWith regard to the humanitarian situation, we welcome the massive and voluntary return of Burundian refugees who had fled the country following the events that plunged Burundi into deep mourning.\nIn addition to several thousands of Burundians who are returning on their own without UNHCR assistance, between 1 August 2017 and 31 August 2020, 92,285 refugees have been voluntarily repatriated to Burundi from Tanzania, but also from Kenya, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda.\nThis massive voluntary return movement is a clear manifestation of the return of peace, tranquillity, confidence and stability in the country.\nAt the diplomatic level, our ambition is to build friendly relations and strengthen cooperation based on the principle of mutual respect and the sovereign equality of States. The tendency of some States to use both subtle and illegal means to manipulate geopolitics in the countries of the South and their power to supplant the international community to oppress other countries by imposing unilateral coercive measures in violation of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations must stop. Burundi is an advocate for multilateralism whereby every country, regardless of its size and level of development, has a role to play in addressing humankind\u2019s many shared challenges.\nIn that regard, Burundi remains open to cooperating with countries and international organizations that seek to further develop mutually beneficial and respectful cooperative relations.\nWe therefore firmly condemn the unjustified political and diplomatic aggression against Burundi and its people by foreign Governments, some of which were known to have attempted regime change in 2015 through unconstitutional means. Power diplomacy must give way to mutually beneficial and respectful cooperation.\nWhile the nature of relations between Africa and countries with a colonial past should be redefined in order to transform the painful history of colonization into opportunities through mutually beneficial cooperation, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the conquests to enslave Africa and the strong resistance of the peoples of Africa to defend themselves against invasions and free themselves from the colonial yoke have claimed millions of lives in Africa and left deep wounds that remain unhealed.\nWith regard to Burundi\u2019s presence on the Security Council\u2019s agenda, we have always said that Burundi is unfairly included on the Security Council\u2019s agenda for political reasons and the self-interests of certain Powers, which have nothing to do with the welfare of the Burundian people who in no way whatsoever pose a threat to international peace and security.\nThat acts as a destabilizing factor for our country instead of promoting peace and tranquillity.\nWe therefore reiterate our legitimate call for the immediate removal of Burundi from the Security Council\u2019s agenda so that it can use its precious time to address socioeconomic development and support national efforts to implement its national development plan for the period from 2018 to 2027 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nConcerning the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, in addition to the integration and alignment of SDGs with the 2018-2027 national development plan, the Government of the Republic of Burundi has highlighted several priorities that require immediate and special attention. They are the fight against poverty, promoting good governance, public health, agriculture and animal husbandry, environmental protection, human capital development, countering youth unemployment and free health care for retirees. In the area of good governance, the Government is implementing a zero-tolerance policy on corruption, social injustice and the misappropriation and wasteful use of State assets, and a policy of best practices in managing State employees.\nLike other countries committed to sustainable development, Burundi has taken every measure needed to produce a regular follow-up report on the implementation of the SDGs and the national development plan.\nIn order to share its experiences on the road it has travelled in implementing the SDGs, its successes, current and emerging challenges and lessons learned, Burundi has submitted to the voluntary national review mechanism in 2020. We remain convinced that, in order for the SDGs, which we all adopted in 2015 to become a reality, we require additional commitment, initiative, effort and, above all, resources.\nMr. President, with regard to global challenges, this session is an excellent opportunity for Member States to reflect on how the Organization must face new emerging challenges. More than ever, the world we live in today requires a consensus approach to addressing major challenges, such as climate change, terrorism, the peaceful settlement of conflicts, the reform of the Security-Council, migration and the management of health crises.\nWith regard to climate, it is necessary to recall that the planet, on which we live and will live for generations to come, is facing a crisis that is worsening by the day with the dramatic rise of climate sceptics. The climate crisis is putting decades of progress at risk and is jeopardizing all the projects we have undertaken to bring about inclusive and sustainable development, while, at the same time, the clock continues click without waiting for us to act.\nAccordingly, in order to contribute to restoring the environment and the improving the country\u2019s environmental, social and economic situation, in November 2017 the Government of the Republic of Burundi launched the Ewe Burundi Urambaye project to significantly reduce the effects of deforestation.\nConcerning the fight against terrorism, while we strongly condemn terrorism in all its forms, my country, Burundi, believes that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any religion, nationality, civilization or ethnicity. It is a borderless threat that requires a global solution by unconditionally tackling the root causes of this evil of our time.\nAs it is aware of the magnitude of terrorism today, my country, Burundi, will continue to make substantial contributions to combating terrorism in Somalia, where my country has deployed more than 5,000 troops and United Nations peacekeeping operations, as well as in the Central African Republic, where Burundi has a military battalion, which is doing excellent work.\nWith regard to the process of regional integration, we welcome the commendable initiative to establish the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which will allow for the free movement of goods and people on the Continent. There is no doubt that the African Continental Free Trade Area represents a genuine opportunity to stimulate growth, reduce poverty and broaden economic inclusion in Africa.\nConcerning the subject of the reform of the Security Council, which has been under negotiations for more than a quarter of a century, my country, Burundi, remains firmly committed to the Common African Position, as contained in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. The Common African Position aims to correct the flagrant injustice committed against Africa, which is the only continent not represented on the Security Council in the category of permanent membership, and which is also underrepresented in the non-permanent category.\nWith regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has led to an unprecedented global crisis, which has literally claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, affected millions of people and threatens to erode before our eyes all the progress already made in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and those of Agenda 2063 of the African Union.\nThe pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of today\u2019s world and highlighted the broad divides in national and global development efforts, such as high levels of poverty and inequality, raging climate change and the continued discrimination of the elderly, poor communities, women and girls, all of which erode social cohesion.\nAll these challenges can only be met through international solidarity, cooperation and the promotion of multilateralism, based on the rule of international law.\nMr. President, in conclusion, my country, Burundi, has never stopped believing in international solidarity, multilateralism and the rejection of power diplomacy. Blessed with that belief, my country Burundi reaffirms its commitment to fully participate in building a world order based on the rule of law, which is peaceful, equitable, prosperous and respectful of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\nI thank everyone for their kind attention. May God bless everyone!"

        "file_text": "President of the General Assembly, Secretary-General of the United Nations, Heads of State and Government, ladies and gentlemen,\nLast year, we met in New York for the General Assembly, and I called on each and every one of you to have the courage to build peace and shoulder our responsibilities together. Such courage, I must say, has been more than severely tested by a health, economic, social and security crisis of an unprecedented scale, which immediately became global, never before seen since the establishment of our Organization 75 years ago. That courage came first and foremost from those who were on the front line from the beginning, all around the world, and who are still there today, providing medical treatment, food, assistance and physical and moral support \u2014 our health-care personnel and humanitarian workers. With these opening words, I wish to place them in our thoughts. They are relying on us to commit to and build concrete responses together, since this crisis, clearly more than any other, requires cooperation and requires us to devise new international solutions.\nFirst of all, I believe in science and knowledge, and humankind will defeat this pandemic; a cure will be found. But, in the meantime, and no one knows how long that will be, each of our countries have no other choice but to learn to live with the virus, and the world will have to learn to live with this new reality that we cannot escape, revealing our weaknesses and placing us before our immediate responsibilities. That new global reality is clear, brutal and certainly dizzying, and we must approach it without giving in to despair and despondency, but with clear-sightedness. All the challenges that we faced were intensified and exacerbated within a few months. The successes achieved were hampered and setbacks accumulated.\nYears of progress in the fight against other infectious diseases, such as AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, which we thought we could eradicate, have been delayed, or worse. More than 37 million people have fallen into, or fallen back into, extreme poverty. Food insecurity is a serious threat, and it has increased. More than 1 billion students have been affected by schools closing in more than 160 countries. Forty million children have been deprived of their first year of education. Women have been on the front line and have seen all forms of sexual, domestic and gender-based violence build up against them.\nIn the light of that and the many other effects of the pandemic that has struck our planet and which continues to affect every continent, our means of collective action has further fragmented. While the only solution will be found through our cooperation, the international organizations that we crucially need, such as the World Health Organization, have been accused by some of complacency, while others manipulate them. Trusted third-party scientists and journalists, who are so essential to our understanding and ability to efficiently respond to the crisis, have been undermined by State propaganda, as well as the misinformation epidemic. Our Organization risked powerlessness. The Security Council, the guarantor of peace and stability, struggled to agree on a humanitarian truce that we supported with all our strength. Just imagine. We struggled so much to agree on so little. But the permanent members were unable, in such exceptional circumstances, to come together as we would have liked, because two of them chose to demonstrate their rivalry rather than collective effectiveness. All of fractures that existed before the pandemic \u2014 the hegemonic clash of Powers, the undermining and the manipulation of multilateralism and the trampling of international law \u2014 have only increased and deepened due to the global destabilization created by the pandemic.\nWe can no longer turn a blind eye. We no longer have the option or, if I may say, luxury to dither. The pandemic must be a wake-up call for our Organization, and a moment of redemption. That is possible because, in this challenge, we have seen signs of hope.\nAs a result of the crisis, the European Union, which many predicted would become divided and powerless, has taken a historic step towards unity, sovereignty, solidarity and a vision of the future. It was Europe that, together with its African partners, took the initiative at the Group of Twenty (G-20) to help the most vulnerable countries to tackle the pandemic and ease the debt burden that weighs on economies and jeopardizes the continent\u2019s future. For the first time at a G-20 finance meeting, we agreed a debt moratorium for the poorest countries in Africa. It was Europe that, with its partners, created the ACT-A initiative so that resources to combat the pandemic would be accessible to all. Thanks to Europe, along with others, the World Health Assembly decided to learn lessons from the pandemic and improve early-warning and response systems to better prevent such crises. It was Europe that, together with its partners in Asia, America and Africa, has had the drive to develop, propose and provide tangible solutions through cooperation, solidarity and action.\nIn the future, we will need to take into account these new balances that are currently taking shape. We will need to rely on the strength of goodwill, because the world, as it is today, cannot come down to rivalry between China and the United States, no matter the global weight of those two great Powers, no matter the history that binds us together, particularly to the United States of America. The crisis, the collapse of our cooperation frameworks and the fragilities that I have just mentioned mean that we must rebuild a new order and that Europe must accept its full share of responsibility. That means upholding its values and its affinity for the future and building new solutions because we are not collectively condemned to a dance of power, which would, in a way, reduce us to merely being the sorry spectators of collective powerlessness. We have room to manoeuvre; it is up to us to make use of that space and to define our priorities in such an environment. We need to establish our choices clearly and build new partnerships. In the coming weeks and months, there will be fundamental choices to be made and decisions to be taken before our peoples and the international community. Those choices will have an immediate impact on the life of our nations, the existence of our citizens and the global course. We must not shy away from them, because it is precisely when things become shaky that we must get back to what is important. And I have very strongly believed, since the start of the present COVID-19 crisis, that this is not some sort of parenthesis that has opened and will reclose; this is what arises in a world beset by deep-seated crises stemming from our very interdependencies. There will undoubtedly one day be a cure for the pandemic, but there will be no miracle cure for the destruction of the modern order. There will be no miracle cure for the sort of paradox in which we are immersed. Our societies have never been so interdependent. And at the very moment when all this is taking place, never have we been so out of tune, so out of alignment, so incapable of building quick solutions \u2014 so wrapped up in our own situations as even to destroy the frameworks for cooperation we managed to build throughout the past decades.\nThis is why I wanted to lay out before this Assembly the five priorities on which France wishes \u2014 primarily with its European partners, but also with all the powers of goodwill, that is to say with all those prepared to engage in doing so \u2014 to lay the foundations for a new modern consensus that will allow us to act concretely in the world as it is.\nThe first principle, or the first objective, is the fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and against terrorism, the leading threats to our collective security.\nThe strategy of maximum pressure, pursued for several years, has not yet made it possible to put an end to the destabilizing activities of Iran, or to ensure that Iran will not be able to acquire nuclear weapons. That is why France, which, you will remember, was not the country that initiated the negotiations at the time, then designed the JCPOA. But France, with its German and British partners, will continue demanding the full implementation of the 2015 Vienna Agreement and will not accept the violations committed by Iran. However, we will not compromise on the activation of a mechanism that the United States, on its own, when leaving the agreement, is not in a position to activate. That would undermine the unity of the Security Council and the integrity of its decisions, and it would run the risk of further aggravating tensions in the region. But we need to build over time a useful framework for action, as I recalled before the General Assembly now more than two years ago \u2014 that is to say, the capacity to implement the 2015 agreement. First, promptly, to ensure that, in the long term, Iran will never gain access to nuclear weapons, but also to ensure that we will respond to Iran\u2019s ballistic activity and destabilization of the region.\nOn North Korea, we supported the efforts of the United States of America to pave the way for negotiations to begin. Even though tangible results are yet to be attained, these initiatives were important, and what we are waiting for now are concrete gestures of commitment from North Korea. It must comply with the resolutions of the Security Council and engage promptly and in good faith in a process of complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization. This is the only possible way to achieve a political solution and lasting peace on the Korean peninsula. It essential for regional stability and security as well as for international peace and security.\nLikewise, we will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons in Europe, in Russia or in Syria. In the name of collective security, I repeat here to Russia the need for light to be fully shed on the attempted assassination of a member of the political opposition using a novichok nerve agent. This investigation must be swift and full, as we will enforce our red lines. And, in this area, France has always fully applied its red lines set since I have been President of the Republic. Our collective security also means fighting terrorism wherever necessary. Terrorism struck on French soil, and in our flesh, several times in recent years, with terrorist acts at times fomented in the very heart, at the epicentre, of Islamist terrorism. I am thinking, in particular, of the 2015 attacks planned in Syria. This is why France will always be strongly committed to the Levant and in support of Iraqi sovereignty, and stands alongside its Sahelian partners. In the Levant, we will remain committed members of the international coalition. We won an initial victory in ending the territorial caliphate. That victory did not signal an end to the war in the region. We will continue to fight against all terrorists in the context of the international coalition and alongside all our regional partners. Here I wish to recall the role Kurdish fighters played in Syria alongside the coalition against Da\u2019esh and the terrorists. I also wish to recall the essential role that Iraq and its people played and continue to play in this fight. This is why France strongly supports all the initiatives Iraq is taking today and will continue to take for its sovereignty and its role in the fight against terrorism.\nIn the Sahel, France is, as you know, deeply involved, primarily alongside the five States of the Sahel. The Pau and Nouakchott summits made it possible to lay the groundwork for a coalition to strengthen the fight against our two enemies in this region, the Islamic State and Al-Qaida. Both organizations have suffered unprecedented setbacks in recent months. The objectives set in Pau, to focus on the tri-border region and the ISGS, produced unprecedented tangible results. We will continue these efforts. With the support of Barkhane and our European and American partners, the G-5 Sahel armies have regained the advantage, reclaiming positions that had been lost. This dynamic must continue. This is the very purpose of the coalition we are building. Events in Mali over recent weeks further remind us of the obvious: democracy and the fight against terrorism go hand in hand. These two struggles are inextricable. And only democracy, justice, the rule of law and development will restore lasting peace to the Sahel. Those who entered Mali in the name of these principles must not now betray them. They must put Mali irreversibly on track towards the restoration of civilian authority and the prompt holding of elections. France, like its African partners in particular, can only remain engaged on this condition. I will say it and repeat it very clearly: France is only present on Malian soil, as on the soil of other countries in the region, at the request of sovereign States and regional organizations. The very second those States want us to leave or believe they can fight terrorism on their own, we will withdraw. I therefore asked for reiteration, in Pau then in Nouakchott, of that request, that need for our involvement, which was also reconfirmed by the junta in Mali. And we will remain highly vigilant on this point. I believe in the sovereignty of peoples, and I think that our fight against terrorism can be meaningful and sustainable only if it is combined with respect for that sovereignty, along with effective democracy and a genuine development policy such as the one we designed with the Alliance for the Sahel, which, along with our European and African partners as well as the World Bank, we are continuing to develop in order to undertake constructive action on the ground.\nThe second priority for the coming months, in my view, is the demanding task of building peace and stability with respect for the sovereign equality of peoples. The grammar of peace and stability must be redefined, because the lines have shifted radically as a result of the crisis; in fact, they had changed well before it. The withdrawal of America, which acted as the guarantor of last resort of an international system that is now struggling; the hegemonic assertion of other Powers as a result of that disengagement; China\u2019s projection beyond its borders; and the strengthening of European sovereignty are all underlying trends that should lead us to rethink the modalities of our collective action aimed at ensuring peace and security. Our policy principles in this respect must be clear, and we must no longer hesitate to apply them: respect for the sovereign rights of peoples, the consolidation of States based on the rule of law and of their means of implementation, and the requirement and responsibility to ensure the effective implementation of the decisions taken under the auspices of the United Nations.\nThat is exactly what we are doing in Lebanon, where the aspirations of the sovereign Lebanese people must be respected, heard and supported despite the unacceptable transgressions of the Lebanese political class. I wish to reiterate here my full support for the Lebanese people and my determination to act from where I am and with full respect for Lebanese sovereignty, in a spirit of friendship and expectation, as I have so often said, so that Lebanon can recover, so that life there can improve and in order to chart the course towards conciliation and a more effective democracy. But Lebanon is a treasure for all humankind \u2014 a treasure because it represents a form of exception, democracy and pluralism in a region that is caught in the grip of terrorism and hegemonic Powers. The United Nations, as it has been doing this summer and over the long term, must work together with civil society and non-governmental organizations in order to tackle immediate needs and begin reconstruction. Here too we will remain fully committed.\nIn Syria, the resumption of talks in Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations is a positive step, but this process cannot be limited to the drafting of a new constitution. It will have to involve the holding of free, fair and transparent elections in order to ensure respect for the aspirations and sovereignty of the Syrian people. France and its European partners will therefore continue to base the financing of reconstruction and the normalization of relations with Damascus on the implementation of a credible political solution, which is the only sustainable solution and the only one that will make it possible to eradicate terrorism in the region.\nPeace in the Middle East remains a necessity, first and foremost for the Israelis and the Palestinians, but also for us all. I welcome the fact that Israel has been recognized by additional Arab countries. That is legitimate recognition. It is also a pledge of hope for the future. However, a just and lasting peace requires above all a path back to decisive negotiations that will allow the Palestinians to finally exercise their rights. There is no alternative to courageous negotiations, which will require agreement on the most difficult issues while respecting the legitimate aspirations of the parties to full recognition of their security and sovereignty. I do not believe in peace built on hegemony or humiliation, even if financial compensation is provided, because we know all too well that money cannot compensate for the humiliation of a people. It is up to us, collectively, to work towards that ambitious solution.\nIn Libya, the crisis is now having a profound impact on regional stability and has been aggravated by increased outside interference. In my view, Libya is the perfect example of the mistakes that we ourselves could make if we fail to respect the sovereignty of peoples. No Power can seek the good of a people unless the people agree to it and build it themselves through their chosen paths of transition. So today we have no choice but to take very concrete action. That is what Europe is doing to effectively and universally enforce the arms embargo decided by the United Nations. That embargo is currently being violated by several Powers. The situation is not sustainable. Several Powers have also decided to continue importing fighters from the Syrian theatre, exporting terrorism to the region and disregarding the interests of Libya, its neighbours in the Sahel and Europe. Collectively, we have not sufficiently spoken out against those actions, and we must take a much harder line in the weeks to come. We are working together with all our partners in the countries neighbouring Libya to achieve a sustainable ceasefire and then to set in motion a process enabling a political resolution to the conflict under the auspices of the United Nations. That is the initiative that France wishes to undertake in the coming weeks along with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. We must bring together all neighbouring countries to help reach a solution for Libya. Such renewed involvement on the part of Libya\u2019s neighbours is vital in the long term.\nIn the eastern Mediterranean, we must resume effective and clarified dialogue to avert a fresh area of confrontation and the undermining of international law. The Mediterranean countries of the European Union expressed themselves clearly in that respect a few days ago in Ajaccio. We respect and are prepared to engage in dialogue with Turkey, but we expect it to respect European sovereignty and international law and provide clarification concerning its activities in Libya and in Syria. Insults are ineffective. Such words and actions have no place in responsible relations among States nor can they obfuscate Europe\u2019s call for accountability. We Europeans are ready for dialogue and for the essential construction of a Pax Mediterranea, but not through intimidation or a bullying mentality. There must be respect for international law and cooperation and respect among allies. Those principles are non-negotiable.\nIn continental Europe, regarding the Ukrainian crisis, this year the Normandy format allowed us, along with the Federal Chancellor of Germany, to make some initial progress. But the situation in Belarus could lead to further division within our continent. The courage of the people of Belarus commands the admiration of us all. Their aspirations must be fulfilled, and we stand alongside them. I cannot stress this enough. A national political dialogue must be established and any external interference avoided. Along with the German Chancellor and the President of the European Council, we had the opportunity to hold discussions with President Putin in which we advocated for the mediation proposed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. We see no other way forward. Neither interference nor guilty silence is a solution. Europe, in this area as well, will deliver with respect to its responsibility, its history and its geography. But believing in peace and stability in our region also means wanting to build a new grammar, as it were, for continental Europe, for lasting stability. That cannot be reduced to historical agreements or the dismantling of such agreements in recent years. When we speak of peace and stability, and of collective security for Europe, I cannot remain silent today about the fact that we are living in a situation where our security and stability greatly depend on agreements signed in the past between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and that such agreements have been gradually dismantled over the past decade. The end of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles marked an important step that we must not remain silent about. That is why I hope that we, as Europeans, can re-engage in a comprehensive and ambitious discussion with all our neighbours with regard to our collective security and build a new framework that takes into account the end of these historic treaties. I also want to be very clear when I say that we will not delegate our collective security to Powers other than Europe.\nThirdly, we must protect our common goods. That is the responsibility of all, as it goes beyond our national interests and regional balances. Protecting our common goods is not at odds with the exercise of our sovereignty. On the contrary, it is the only way to truly preserve our sovereignty by maintaining control over our future. This is exactly what the crisis we face has unquestionably taught us once again.\nDuring an epidemic, the health of one is the health of all. We have a unique opportunity to make the means for combating the pandemic into global public goods to which everyone should have access. That is the meaning behind the action we are taking under the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, which we will consolidate in the coming months across all pillars, particularly with regard to improving health systems. Health, a global public good, is a battle we have been waging throughout the past year, as well as in Lyon, mobilizing the international community once again to finance the fight against historic epidemics. This is what we will continue to do and we must step up our efforts in the months ahead.\nNow more than ever, the climate and biodiversity must be central to our collective agenda \u2014 not in words, but deeds. This December marks five years since the signing of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We already know that the objectives we collectively set will not be achieved. The response to the pandemic can help us change course. The massive recovery plans adopted in all countries provide a historic opportunity to transform our economic and development models. That must be a core element of the European Union\u2019s ambition, and I would like to thank the President of the European Commission for her strong commitment. It must also be a core aspect of the work of the Group of Seven and the Group of 20. It is vital. That is also why, to mark the five-year anniversary of the Paris Agreement, I want France to mobilize the international community anew so that each and every one of us can take stock of our commitments without changing them and without muddying the waters, but instead by transparently renewing the commitment of all of our countries and regions with revitalized determination.\nIn the coming weeks, I am determined to see Europe reach a more ambitious agreement to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The President of the European Commission has set the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 per cent by 2030. That means we need to move more quickly and decisively towards an ambitious emission trading scheme, a carbon price floor and a carbon border tax. These measures must be taken together. One without the others would not be as effective.\nOn this basis and alongside our British and European partners, we will seek out the commitments of the major emitters ahead of the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and we will stand by our partners, particularly in Africa, to achieve our common goals. The December meeting will be essential in that regard. In November, we will host a summit of development banks in Paris to ensure that all financial flows contribute to an environmental and inclusive recovery, in line with the Paris Agreement. On biodiversity, which we now know is clearly linked to climate change and human health, as has been demonstrated, we will be organizing a One Planet Summit in Marseilles with the United Nations and the World Bank. This One Planet Summit will enable us to build an agenda of concrete actions for protected land and marine areas, agroecology, biodiversity financing and the fight against deforestation, as well as the protection of ecosystems and species. The oceans, the poles and rainforests are part of the common heritage of humankind. It is our duty to protect them and we will do so ahead of the key events for the United Nations, including the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on climate, biodiversity and the fight against desertification. As a show of commitment, I propose that we organize a summit next year in New York, ahead of the three Conferences of the Parties, so as to generate decisive impetus and produce tangible results.\nThe digital space is also a common good \u2014 a unique, open and trusted common good, which requires a new type of governance so that it is not captured, pirated and exploited. That is the meaning behind the initiatives that we are championing as part of the International Partnership on Information and Democracy of the Christchurch Appeal and the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence. We must consolidate each of these partnerships and make progress on the Aqaba Process. In that regard, I would like to thank the Prime Minister of New Zealand and the King of Jordan for their commitment to that agenda. These are now concrete solutions, but what we need now more than simply commitments is the action of major stakeholders and platforms, as well as and a commitment on the part of all of us to legislate and to regulate in our regions if they do not honour their commitments. The fight against hatred, the fight against terrorism and the creation of a common public order on the Internet are as important as technological innovation and freedom, because there can be no freedom without public order. It is up to us to create it through international action. I do not believe that the protection of freedom of expression can tolerate the discourse of terrorism, hate speech and anonymity in a way that permits the loss of inhibitions and is a cover for the violence it spurs. This agenda is vital to us all, and we will continue to take decisive action.\nFinally, and I say this in the context of the epidemic that I just mentioned \u2014 education is an essential common good on which we will continue to work in the coming year. Hundreds of millions of our young people have dropped out of school because of the epidemic, but education, particularly the education of young girls, continues to be a priority, especially in Africa. Alongside President Macky Sail, we have committed to the Global Partnership for Education. We have raised new funds to finance the actions of the Partnership. The role today of the World Bank, of the United Nations, of the Global Partnership for Education, of UNESCO \u2014 the role also of our bilateral actions \u2014 must be strengthened in order to act even more effectively in the months and years to come in order to improve education, especially the education of young girls. This fight is not over \u2014 far from it \u2014 and we cannot forget that. In any event, it is at the heart of France\u2019s commitment to defending and fighting for global public goods.\nThe fourth priority is the construction of a new era of globalization. The first era of globalization was initiated by the travels of Christopher Columbus and Ferdinand Magellan; it was that of discovery. It was also the era for the first invasions, of a kind of trial and error, of a form of fascination or sometimes of mutual misunderstandings.\nThe second era was that of the colonial empires and the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century, where globalization was through trade, the first opening up to the outside world, but also of the slave routes, the exploitation or development of some and the enslavement of others, the first population displacements and a reconfiguration of our world in the light of these acts of domination.\nThe third era began in 1989 with the fall of the Berlin Wall, the opening of borders, the belief in the possibility that the circulation of goods and people and the subsequent generalization of the Internet would lead to convergences of interests, values and ideas.\nI have gone through a quick presentation of history in my address to the Assembly, when each of these eras could be separated into many other periods. But, basically, it is this third era of globalization that for the past 10 years or so has been called into question. That is because there was a deep conviction \u2014 the teleology that accompanied it \u2014 that this globalization would be one of peace, a rapprochement of values and a universalization of respect for others. That has been called into question by the financial crisis, the transformations of the world, the return of peoples, the awakening of national consciences and, finally, the global pandemic. Further, it has been called into question by a deep crisis \u2014 the crisis of the Western middle classes that at one point began to doubt what this new order, called by some the happy globalization, could bring to them, given that it was these middle classes that, everywhere in the West, were often the variables in the economic, and then cultural, adjustments required for the world to be so open.\nIt would therefore be unjustifiable in a way to deny everything that the third era of globalization has made possible, to deny everything that this period has brought in terms of prosperity. It has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of extreme poverty, precisely through a redistribution of world trade and production. Openness has raised awareness of travel and circulation, which has also partly improved our relations. It would be dangerous to lock ourselves into a historical stuttering where we engage in generalized protectionism by enacting customs duties and starting trade wars, falling into a kind of doubt that would lead us to the isolation or logic of power struggles. In our view, the risk is responding to this crisis of globalization with a nationalist retreat, with the violence of populism and extremism, and with the return of dominant Powers.\nBut it is clear that global value chains need to be rethought today because the crisis has shown that dependence on such strategic sectors as health, digital technology, artificial intelligence as well as food can call into question the free exercise of sovereignty in the world as it is. We have also seen that there are good dependencies and there are dependencies that weaken us. We need to preserve international trade and openness because it is good for us economically and socially, because we cannot reinternalize everything, because this approach leads to just dependencies that require cooperation.\nBut complete dependence on certain forces, be they technological, food-related or industrial, creates vulnerabilities that no longer allow for the kind of balances the world order requires. Furthermore, the inequalities of this new world order have become unsustainable. We have lifted hundreds of millions of people out of the extreme poverty that could be found in some countries. We have partly reduced North- South inequalities, but within some of our countries we have deepened inequalities. Furthermore, this new order makes the course of things play out in ways that are democratically unsustainable. Moreover, we have created a globalized consciousness that is today a kind of globalization, no longer of the knowledge that formed the basis of the Internet, but of feeling and resentment.\nFor each of these crises, we must provide a response. This is the strategy that the European Union, together with other Powers, is developing. It is imperative that our international rules be adapted to take account of these new realities and provide ourselves with the means for more balanced international cooperation anchored in respect for the sovereignty of each country and for the benefit of all. In this respect, the fight against inequalities must clearly be at the heart of this reconsidered globalization. France has taken initiatives that have yielded results on women\u2019s entrepreneurship, on the Global Partnership for Education and on health for all, in order to fight against all inequalities of fate. But we must go further.\nIn a way, it is clear that this world in which we have lived was based on an academic consensus that gave way to a political and market consensus, which has often been called the Washington Consensus. It has run its course. Together, we must lay the foundations for a more just, more balanced, fairer and more sustainable form of globalization. We must reflect upon the terms of a globalization that accepts revisiting and rethinking the meaning of just sovereignty and fair trade, integrating the fight against inequalities in all their forms at the heart of its model, be they in terms of gender, social or economic condition, as well as the fight against global warming and in favour of biodiversity \u2014 one that allows for the sustainable integration of conditions for a new equilibrium in the world.\nIn this regard, as well, at the Paris Forum in a few weeks\u2019 time, we will also have to make concrete proposals, and the work undertaken with the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and many other forces for good will be essential. Along with Europe, Africa will be the driving force behind this redefinition of the terms of globalization, which is why we will continue to pursue our efforts within the framework of the initiative we established to help African countries face the pandemic at all levels \u2014 health, economic, social and humanitarian. In addition, the Group of Twenty summit in November will be a decisive meeting for the implementation of the debt moratorium that we have agreed upon and for going further. We must also improve our support for the immense energies of civil societies and the youth of the continent, which are its strength and its future. This is the underlying meaning of the initiatives we will carry out in the coming months with the diasporas and in support of the African private sector.\nFinally, the fifth objective that I want to propose to the international community is enhancing respect for international humanitarian law and the fundamental rights of each individual. For me, this objective is essential to the very survival of the United Nations. Indeed, we have been witnessing a series of setbacks in this area and often too much silence. Since the United Nations established World Humanitarian Day, 5,000 personnel have been attacked and 1,800 have been murdered. The past year has been the deadliest yet. My thoughts go out in particular to these young French women and men who, within the Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development, worked in that very context, in the Niger, and were killed in atrocious conditions last August. No, the United Nations cannot sit idle in the face of such setbacks. This is why, with French non-governmental organizations and our international partners, we are building an initiative to ensure the effectiveness of international law, the protection of humanitarian personnel and the fight against impunity. The humanitarian space is a common heritage that we must protect by guaranteeing access to civilian populations and the protection of the personnel who support them. We have seen inexcusable setbacks on this subject. We have seen unacceptable practices, including on the part of permanent members of the Security Council, in Syria in particular. The neutrality of humanitarian action must be respected and its criminalization curbed.\nTaking up our responsibilities in the humanitarian field also means showing solidarity and humanity in the area of migration. The situation at Moria, in Greece, is very difficult today. France, alongside Germany and its partners, will shoulder its responsibilities to welcome refugees, and we must all act together in the management of migratory flows so as to put an end to the trafficking of human beings, fatal crossings and routes of necessity. This will be at the heart of the European agenda for the coming weeks. I will have the opportunity to come back to it. We must step up the fight against these traffickers and live up to our responsibilities.\nFinally, fundamental rights are not a Western idea that can be treated as interference on the part of all those who refer to them. These are the principles of our Organization, enshrined in texts that the States Members of the United Nations have freely consented to sign and to respect. That is the reason why, in particular, France has requested that an international mission, under the aegis of the United Nations, be dispatched to Xinjiang in order to take into account our collective concerns on the situation of the Uyghur Muslim minority.\nAnd it is because we cannot tolerate the fact that, 25 years after the Beijing Conference, the rights of women throughout the world are experiencing a deep decline that we will organize next summer the Generation Equality Forum, alongside UN-Women and civil society, for the emancipation of all, the education of girls and the real and effective respect of human rights.\nThese are the five principles on which France wants to rebuild, with Member States, the foundations of the international order so that the foundations of our Organization are not washed away by the pandemic. On the contrary, as Winston Churchill said, if you do not take change by the hand, it will take you by the throat. This requires the establishment of functional international cooperation based on clear rules, defined and respected by all. Multilateralism is not just an act of faith; it is an operational necessity. No country will emerge from this ordeal on its own. International cooperation can be difficult, but it is objectively imperative.\nHowever, we can no longer settle for a multilateralism of words that merely serves to accept the lowest common denominator as a way of hiding deep differences under a facade of consensus. We have to change our methods, reverse the terms of the contract, raise our voices loud and clear when some people pride themselves on adhering to alliances and their principles, organizations and their principles, only to trample on them in reality. Let us be honest, clear-headed and demanding with one another. Contemporary multilateralism must also involve international organizations, private actors, businesses, non-governmental organizations, researchers and citizens so that everyone is involved in the actions undertaken. It will be built on the basis of solid, respected and verified agreements among partners in good faith, around clear objectives and rules, and with real responsibility and accountability mechanisms.\nThis is why, at the Paris Peace Forum in November, we will strive with our European and African partners, and with all those in Asia, America and elsewhere who wish to join us, to consolidate the bases of this new international consensus, to the benefit of the future of our Organization. I do not believe in some great day of refoundation. I believe in determined, methodical, rigorous work to build a contemporary international order that will spare future generations the scourge of war, to assert human rights and equality between nations, and to promote social progress in greater freedom. That is the very promise of our Charter. It is timely. I believe in the strength of will and the value of sincerity and courage. And speaking to you at this very moment, despite the distance created by the screen, I remember the gaze of a Lebanese child I met a few days ago, who had lost everything \u2014 absolutely everything \u2014 but who had sworn to fight against all odds for what she believed in. I remember, too, the young French people murdered in the Niger because they believed in a world of humanity, solidarity and fraternity. But those I address today surely do and must have similar memories, which oblige us to act, excludes cynicism, and forbids us from losing hope or taking the easy way out. There are lives, but above all there are young girls and boys all over the world who get involved because they believe our words, because they live for and by our principles. If we betray them, it will be our fault above all if they are disillusioned or lose everything. So it is up to us. I know we can do it. In any case, wherever we are, we will do everything we can to act and I know that many of may counterparts are ready to do so as well. I count on each and every one of them. Thank you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, Secretary-General Guterres, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nI am honoured to address the United Nations General Assembly once again.\nI congratulate His Excellency Mr. Volkan Bozkir on his election as the President of the seventy-fifth session of the General Assembly.\nWe also appreciate the skilful leadership of the outgoing President, His Excellency Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, especially during the COVID-19 crisis.\nWe commend the leadership of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in these turbulent times.\nMr. President,\nSince my government assumed office, our consistent effort has been to fundamentally transform Pakistan.\nWe envisage \u2018Naya Pakistan\u2019 to be modelled on the principles of the State of Madinah, established by our Holy Prophet (PBUH).\nA just and humane society where all Government policies are directed at lifting our citizens out of poverty and creating a just and equitable dispensation.\nTo achieve this goal, we need to have peace and stability. Thus our foreign policy aims to have peace with our neighbours and settle disputes through dialogue.\nMr. President,\nThe 75th Anniversary of the United Nations is an extremely important milestone as this is the only body in the world that can help us achieve our goal of peace and stability in our neighbourhood. This is also a time for us to reflect whether as the United Nations we have been able to realize the promise we collectively made to our peoples.\nToday, the foundations of \u2018world order\u2019- non-use of or threat of unilateral force, self-determination of peoples, the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States, non-interference in their internal affairs, international cooperation \u2014 all these ideals are being systematically eroded.\nInternational agreements are being flouted and set aside.\nRenewed great-power rivalries are leading to a new arms race.\nConflicts are proliferating and intensifying.\nMilitary occupation and illegal annexations are suppressing the right of human beings to self-determination.\nAccording to respected Professor Noam Chomsky, mankind is at even a greater risk than it was before the First and Second World Wars in the last century because of the increased threat of nuclear war, Climate Change, and sadly the rise of authoritarian regimes. We must come together to prevent such a catastrophe.\nWe believe the driving force in international relations must be cooperation, in accordance with principles of international law, and not confrontation and force.\nWe all must emphatically reaffirm our support for multilateralism.\nMr. President,\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated the oneness of humanity. In our interconnected world, no one is safe unless everyone is safe.\nLocking down to control the pandemic has triggered the worst recession since the GreatDepression in the last Century. This has hit the poorest countries the hardest as well as the poor in all the countries.\nIn Pakistan, we realized very early on that if we imposed a strict lockdown, the type that several affluent countries had imposed, we would have more people dying of hunger than the virus.\nTherefore, we adopted a policy of \u2018smart lockdown.\u2019 While concentrating on the virus hot-spots we opened up our agricultural sector immediately and then followed it up with the construction sector,which employed most of the people.\nAt the same time, and this is despite financial constraints, my government deployed an unprecedented $8 billion for our health services; plussupport the poorest and most vulnerable households with direct cash payments through Ehsaas programme; and subsidies to small businesses.\nEven though our \u2018smart lockdown\u2019 was heavily criticized in the beginning, but thanks to Almighty Allah\u2019s Grace, we have not only managed to control the virus, stabilize our economy, but most importantly, we have been able to protect the poorest segment of the society from the worst fall out of the lock down.\nToday, Pakistan\u2019s response is cited among the success stories in controlling and responding to the pandemic. However, we are still not out of the woods, like no country is out of the woods today.\nMr. President,\nIt was obvious from the outset that developing countries would need fiscal space to respond to, and recover from, the COVID-19 crisis.\nDebt relief is one of the best ways to create that fiscal space for developing countries. Therefore, in early April, I called for a \u201cGlobal Initiative on Debt Relief\u201d.\nWe appreciate the G-20\u2019s official debt suspension initiative and the emergency and rapid financing offered by the IMF, World Bank, Asian Development Bank and UN Agencies.\nThis, however, is not enough.\nThe IMF has estimated that developing countries will need over $2.5 trillion to respond and recover from the crisis.\nThe official debt suspension will need to be extended and expanded.\nAdditional debt relief measures will also be needed.\nMultilateral Development Banks should ensure adequate financial inflows.\nRich countries have generated over ten trillion dollars to finance their own response and recovery. They should support the creation of at least $500 billion in new Special Drawing Rights for the developing world.\nMr. President,\nIn my address to the General Assembly last year, I had highlighted the tremendous damage that illicit financial flows from developing countries to rich countries and offshore tax havens cause. This leads to the impoverishment of the developing nations. Money that could be used towards human development is siphoned off by corrupt elites.The loss of foreign exchange causes currency depreciation that in turn leads to inflation and poverty.\nThe quest for getting back these stolen resources is nearly impossible, given the cumbersome procedures. Moreover, the powerful money launderers have access to the best lawyers. And sadly, because they are the beneficiaries, there is a lack of political will in the rich countries to curb this criminal activity.\nMr. President,\nIf this phenomena is unaddressed, it will continue to accentuate the inequality between the rich and the poor nations, and eventually will spark off a far bigger global crisis than the present migration issue poses.\nThe rich states cannot hold forth on human rights and justice when they provide sanctuary to money launderers\u2019 and their looted wealth and protection of their person.\nThere are robust anti-Money Laundering and anti-Terrorist Financing regimes. I call upon this Assembly to take the lead in efforts to build a global framework to stem the illicit financial flows and ensure speedy repatriation of stolen wealth.\nIt is important to realize that the aid that flows from rich countries to the developing world is miniscule compared to the massive out-flows by our corrupt elites.\nMr. President,\nThis year, I must again reiterate the threat posed to mankind due to\nClimate Change. Unprecedented fires in Australia, Siberia, California, Brazil; unprecedented flooding in various parts of the world; and record temperatures even in the Arctic Circle. This should make us all worried for our future generations.\nCommitments made through the Paris Agreement must be fulfilled, in particular the commitment to mobilize $100 billion annually as climate finance.\nPakistan\u2019s contribution to carbon emissions is minimal, but it is one of those countries most affected by climate change. Yet, we have decided to take the lead as we consider addressing climate change a universal responsibility.\nWe have launched an extremely ambitious programme to plant 10 billion trees in next three years as our contribution to mitigating the effects of climate change.\nMr. President,\nThe pandemic was an opportunity to bring humanity together.\nUnfortunately, it has instead fanned nationalism, increased global tensions, and given rise to racial and religious hatred and violence against vulnerable minorities in several places.\nThese trends have also accentuated \u2018Islamophobia\u2019.\nMuslims continue to be targeted with impunity in many countries. Our shrines are being destroyed; our Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) insulted; the Holy Quran burnt \u2014 and all this in the name of freedom of speech.\nIncidents in Europe, including republication of blasphemous sketches by Charlie Hebdo, are recent examples.\nWe stress that wilful provocations and incitement to hate and violence must be universally outlawed.\nThis Assembly should declare an \u201cInternational Day to Combat Islamophobia\u201d and build a resilient coalition to fight this scourge \u2014 scourge that splits humanity.\nMr. President,\nThe one country in the world today where, the state sponsors Islamophobia, is India. The reason behind this is RSS ideology that unfortunately rules India today.\nThis extremist ideology was founded in 1920s. The RSS founding fathers were inspired by the Nazis and they adopted the concepts of racial purity and supremacy. While the Nazis hate was directed at the Jews, the RSS directs it towards the Muslims and to a lesser extent towards the Christians.\nThey believe that India is exclusive for Hindus and others are not equal citizens. The secularism of Gandhi and Nehru has been replaced by the dream of creating a Hindu Rashtra by subjugating, even cleansing India\u2019s 200 million Muslims and other minorities.\nIn 1992, the RSS destroyed Babri Mosque; in 2002, some 2000 Muslims were slaughtered in Gujarat, and this was under the watch of Chief Minister Modi; and in 2007, over 50 Muslims were burnt alive by RSS arsonists aboard the Samjhota Express Train.\nIn Assam, around two million Muslims face the prospects of being arbitrarily stripped of their nationality through the adoption of discriminatory laws. There are reports of large concentration camps being filledwith by Muslim Indian citizens.\nMuslims were falsely blamed, vilified and victimized for spreading the Corona virus. They were denied medical attention on many occasions, their businesses were boycotted.\nCow vigilantes attack and kill Muslims with impunity. Last February, Muslims faced targeted killings, with police complicity inNew Delhi.\nMass registrations in the past have often been a precursor to genocide, e.g. the Nuremburg Laws in Germany in 1935 and then in 1982 inMyanmar.\nThe Hindutva ideology is set to marginalize almost 300 million human beings \u2014 Muslims, Christians and Sikhs. This is unprecedented in history and does not augur well for the future of India as we all know that marginalization of human beings leads to radicalization.\nMr. President,\nFor over 72 years, India has illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir against the wishes of the Kashmiri people, and in blatant violation of the resolutions of the Security Council and indeed its own commitments.\nOn 5th August last year, India illegally and unilaterally sought to change the status of the occupied territories and deployed additional troops, bringing the total number to 900,000, to impose a military siege on 8 million Kashmiris. All Kashmiri political leaders were incarcerated; about 13,000 Kashmiri youth were abducted and thousands tortured; a complete curfew was imposed, accompanied by a total communications blackout.\nIndian occupation forces have used brute force including pellet guns against peaceful protestors; imposed collective punishments, including the destruction of entire neighbourhoods, and extra-judicially murdered hundreds of innocent young Kashmiris in fake \u201cencounters\u201d, refusing even to hand over their bodies for burial. The Kashmiri media, and those daring to raise their voice, are being systematically harassed and intimidated through the use of draconian laws.\nAll of this is well documented in the reports of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, communications from the Special Rapporteurs of Human Rights Council, statements from human rights and civil society organizations.\nThe international community must investigate these grave violations and prosecute the Indian civil and military personnel involved in state terrorism and serious crimes against humanity, being perpetrated, with complete impunity.\nMr. President,\nThe objective of this brutal campaign is to impose what the RSS-BJP regime has itself called the \u2018Final Solution\u2019 for Jammu and Kashmir. To this end, the military siege is being followed by moves to change the demographic structure of the occupied territory. This is an attempt to obliterate the distinct Kashmiri identity in order to affect the outcome of a plebiscite envisaged in the UN Security Council resolutions.\nThis action is in violation of the UN Charter, Council resolutions and international law, particularly the 4th Geneva Convention. Changing demographic structure of occupied territory is a war crime.\nMr. President,\nThe brave Kashmiri people will never submit to Indian occupation and oppression. Their struggle is indigenous. They are fighting for a just cause and generation after generation have laid down their lives to rid themselves of Indian occupation.\nThe government and people of Pakistan are committed to standing by and supporting their Kashmiri brothers and sisters in their legitimate struggle for self-determination.\nMr. President,\nIn order to divert attention from its illegal actions and atrocities in Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, India is playing a dangerous game of upping the military ante against Pakistan in a nuclearized strategic environment.\nDespite constant Indian provocations and ceasefire violations along the Line of Control and the Working Boundary targeting innocent civilians, Pakistan has exercised maximum restraint. We have consistently sensitized the world community about a \u2018false flag\u2019 operation and another ill-conceived misadventure by India.\nMy parents, Mr. President, were born in the colonial India and I was the first generation that grew up in an independent Pakistan. I want to make it clear that any attempt by the fascist totalitarian RSS-led Indian government to aggress against Pakistan will be met by a nation that will fight for its freedom to the end.\nMr. President,\nThere will be no durable peace and stability in South Asia until the Jammu and Kashmir dispute is resolved on the basis of international legitimacy. Kashmir has been rightly described as a \u201cnuclear flash point\u201d.\nThe Security Council must prevent a disastrous conflict and secure the implementation of its own resolutions as it did in the case of East Timor. The Council has considered the situation in Jammu and Kashmir three times in the past year. It must take appropriate enforcement actions. It must also take steps to protect the Kashmiris from an impending genocide by India.\nPakistan has always called for a peaceful solution. To this end, India must rescind the measures it has instituted since 5 August 2019, end its military siege and other gross human rights violations, and agree to resolve the Jammu & Kashmir dispute in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people.\nMr. President,\nPakistan\u2019s desire for peace in our region is also manifest in our efforts to promote a political solution in Afghanistan.\nI have consistently maintained over the past two decades that there is no military solution to the decades-old conflict in Afghanistan. The only way forward was and is a political settlement which involves the full spectrum of Afghanistan\u2019s political actors.\nPakistan fully facilitated the process that culminated in the U.S.-Taliban Peace Agreement on 29 February 2020.\nPakistan is deeply gratified that it has fulfilled its part of the responsibility.\nThe Afghan leaders must now seize this historic opportunity to achieve reconciliation and restore peace in their war-torn country.\nThrough the Intra-Afghan Negotiations that commenced on 12 September, they must work out an inclusive, broad-based and comprehensive political settlement. The process must be Afghan-led and Afghan-owned, and without any interference or outside influence.\nEarly return of Afghan refugees must be a part of the political solution. After almost two decades of war, it is imperative not to allow \u201cspoilers\u201d \u2014 within and outside Afghanistan \u2014 to subvert the peace process.\nPeace and stability in Afghanistan will open new opportunities for development and regional connectivity. New vistas of cooperation could emerge with Central Asia and beyond.\nMr. President,\nPalestine remains a \u2018festering wound\u2019. A just and lasting settlement is indispensable, for the Middle East and the world. Illegal annexations of Palestinian territory, the building of illegal settlements and the imposition of inhuman living conditions on the Palestinian people especially in Gaza cannot bring peace to a troubled region.\nPakistan continues to support a two-state solution \u2014 in line with UN General Assembly and Security Council resolutions, within the internationally agreed parameters, pre-1967 borders, and Al-Quds Al-Sharif as the Capital of a united, contiguous and independent Palestinian state.\nMr. President,\nThe United Nations remains the best legitimate avenue for collective action \u2014 in managing international conflicts, fostering peace and security, promoting equitable development and addressing global problems.\nI urge the Secretary-General to take the lead in preventing global conflicts.\nHe should convene Summit-level meetings to address regional hot spots and resolve outstanding disputes.\nThe United Nations should be made fully responsive to the challenges of our times. A comprehensive reform of the United Nations, including the Security Council, is essential to promote greater democracy, accountability, transparency and efficiency.\nPakistan will continue to participate actively in this process and endeavour, with other Member States, to build a world where conflict is outlawed and equitable prosperity for all pursued in conditions of peace and security.\nI thank you."

        "file_text": "Mr President of the General Assembly,\nMr Secretary General of the United Nations,\nHeads of State and Heads of Government,\nDistinguished Delegates.\nMr President,\nLet me warmly congratulate you on your election as President of the 75th session of the General Assembly and convey our deep appreciation to Professor Tijjani Mohammad-Bande for his able leadership during the last session of the General Assembly.\nThis session of the General Assembly is taking place in very special and unique circumstances. Never before had we had to forgo the opportunity to meet, network, and strengthen our bonds among our countries and discuss matters of global concern. I commend the Secretary General and his team for putting in place the business continuity plan which has allowed the UN to pursue its work.\nMr President,\nThe choice of this year\u2019s theme is indeed very appropriate \u2014 \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism \u2014 confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action\u201d. This is exactly what we need.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the fore our collective vulnerabilities, as viruses know no borders. Few are those countries which have not been affected, and many have been affected very badly. We are deeply saddened by the hundreds of thousands of lives lost and the millions of people still afflicted across the world.\nThe social, economic, financial and health impacts will take several months, if not years, to be nullified.\nIn Mauritius we had to take urgent and drastic measures to stop the spread of the pandemic. A sanitary confinement was imposed immediately after the first outbreak as from 20 March, accompanied by the timely and effective implementation of a comprehensive package of public health response and containment measures which enabled us to significantly contain the spread of the pandemic and make our country COVID safe. We now only have a few imported cases which are being carefully monitored.\nI must express my Government\u2019s sincere thanks and gratitude to the World Health Organization for the timely advice it has been giving and which continues to guide our decision-making process for reopening our borders.\nThis pandemic which comes on top of the ongoing global crises of inequality and climate change, has exposed and exacerbated the vulnerabilities and inequalities faced by countries of the South in general and in small island states such as Mauritius in particular.\nDecades of hard-won development gains have been eroded, and lives and livelihoods of many of our people have been disrupted.\nThe services industry, and the travel, tourism, and hospitality sectors have all been severely affected.\nIn the short term, like many other countries, we are focusing on preserving employment which is our pressing concern, and in the long term we will chart a path that leads to a more inclusive and sustainable development. Our topmost priority is to avoid the risk of a possible resurgence through a second wave of COVID-19 because that would be catastrophic for our economy.\nMr President,\nThe pandemic has shown that more than 4.4 billion people are without any form of social safety net or health care. The pursuit of Universal Health Coverage should be at the center of human development. This is the surest way to move closer to a world where everyone benefits from the human right to health.\nDespite all efforts to contain the pandemic, it is clear to us that the only way to overcome it would be through the development of an effective and safe vaccine. And we all know this is not something that all of us can engage in. In developing and producing such vaccines, multinationals and governments must ensure that there is a fair distribution at a price that is affordable to all. Our collective needs have to be taken into account and it is only through our commitment to multilateralism that we will be able to succeed.\nHuman health and planetary health are intrinsically linked; this is not a time for playing politics or making excessive profits from the vaccine.\nThis pandemic cannot be defeated as a divided world.\nThe lives of millions, the economic welfare of billions and the social stability of the world are at stake. Global solidarity and reinforced multilateralism are, therefore, paramount.\nMr President,\nHardly had we had control on the pandemic, that Mauritius became the scene of an environmental disaster following the wreck of a bunker which collapsed on our reef within our internal waters.\nThe ship MV Wakashio ran aground on the pristine reefs at Pointe D\u2019Esny in the South Eastern region of Mauritius on 25 July, following which around 800 tons of fuel oil leaked from its breached tanks which quickly propagated inside our lagoons and the surrounding areas. Bad weather further complicated the spread and restricted our ability to contain it.\nOn 16th August the ship split into two.\nThis oil spill is the worst environmental disaster that Mauritius has ever faced. We are still assessing the damage to the mangroves and the coastal areas. We wish to thank all the countries and the UN system which rushed to assist Mauritius during these difficult times. I have a special word of thanks and gratitude for the people of Mauritius whose display of solidarity and spontaneous support helped protect our Ramsar sites and other environmentally sensitive areas.\nA major campaign of cleanup and general assessment was undertaken but we know for a fact that mangroves and other areas will take time to return to their original state. This disaster, apart from the damage that it has caused to nature, has also adversely affected the livelihood of the fishermen and other people involved in coastal and marine activities.\nA second naval incident in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Sri Lanka only a few weeks later has brought to the fore the need to put in place a robust regional disaster prevention and management system that can be promptly deployed to limit the damage from oil spills. At the same time, there is a need for a review of governance rule concerning bunkers and tankers. Mauritius happens to be on an important and busy sea lane between the west and the Far East and is, therefore, directly concerned.\nWe call on the International Maritime Organisation to address these matters as a matter of urgency. Weaknesses in the current liability and regulatory regime for oil spills and for environmental catastrophes need to be addressed promptly.\nMr President,\nOnce the Pandemic will have been eradicated, and we hope that this happens soon, we will wake up to a new reality \u2014 a reality for which there is no reset button. For many countries, the economy will likely suffer by a 14 to 20 per cent contraction with severe job losses and acute poverty. The road to the achievement of the SDGs will become longer and, in some cases, unattainable within the time frame. Added to these woes, we are witnessing severe weather conditions and other calamities such as wild fires with their lots of devastation. The Pandemic has also resulted in the concentration on national needs at the expense of, and in direct competition with, the outer world. Borders have had to be closed and as a result, we are also witnessing unrest in many parts of the world where citizens are on the streets voicing their frustrations. We, as leaders, need to be attentive to these developments. As much as our efforts at national level are crucial, there is an imperative need for us at global level to take all necessary actions to ensure that the world economy does not sink into depression, that we get back on track on the SDGs, that we recommit to our obligations under the Paris Agreement and more importantly, avoid any action likely to create more tension that could lead to further economic despair. This is the time when multilateralism cannot be jeopardized or put in doubt. The pandemic has taught us that no one is immune to it. The only way to fight it is to do it together, whether it is in the area of prevention, cure or reconstruction.\nWe salute the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative aimed at setting out a vision for delivering the SDGs over the course of the Decade for Action and recovering better from COVID-19. We also commend the initiative of Canada and Jamaica on financing for development. Likewise, we are thankful to all the other countries and organizations that made significant amounts of funds available to face the pandemic. What we need now is long term planning accompanied by adequate funds to ensure that affected countries can pursue their development path, for economies to grow and for the populations to survive. Access to funds should be made less complex, and the discrimination linked to categorization of income status should be suspended at least until such time that these countries are able to stabilize their economies.\nMr President,\nWe appreciate the important work undertaken in respect of reaching a legally binding instrument on biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction. As we move to the drafting stage, it will be important to provide better clarity on marine organisms in the extended continental shelf of coastal states. In our view, the coastal state should enjoy full rights on those organisms whether they are found on the seabed or above.\nIn the 75 years of its existence, the world has undergone profound changes. By the sheer fact that the membership of the UN has quadrupled and the poles of economic power have been shifting, it is essential that the composition of the Security Council should reflect a fair, equitable and geographically representative body. Our United Nations will be strengthened when we all feel well represented and have a say in the decision-making process. That is why we believe the African continent must have its legitimate seats both in the permanent and non-permanent categories of the Security Council. A reformed and enlarged Security Council with all regions and SIDS represented will restore confidence and enhance legitimacy of its work and our organization itself.\nA rules-based international order with the UN and multilateralism at its core, is the guarantor for peace and shared prosperity.\nIt is important for all of us to reaffirm our conviction to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations which is the cornerstone of International law. This remains timeless, universal and an indispensable foundation for a more peaceful, prosperous, and just world. It is also important that the institutions that we have collectively created operate independently and their rulings respected by all countries irrespective of their size and power.\nMr President,\nAs the General Assembly is aware, the decolonization of Mauritius remains incomplete despite the clear and unambiguous Advisory Opinion given at its request by the International Court of Justice on 25 February 2019 which determined that the Chagos Archipelago is an integral part of Mauritius, and UN General Assembly Resolution 73/295 which required the United Kingdom to end its administration of the Archipelago by 22 November of last year.\nThe UK continues to ignore the International Court of Justice as well as its obligations under international law by maintaining its unlawful occupation of the Chagos Archipelago. The General Assembly, given its crucial role in the process of decolonization, must take all necessary actions to ensure that all remnants of colonialism are dismantled as soon as possible, especially as we celebrate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations.\nThe General Assembly has also been tasked with assisting Mauritius in the resettlement of the forcibly displaced inhabitants of the Chagos Archipelago. I need not recall the horrendous conditions in which these innocent persons were made to leave their homes. That by itself was a major crime, but what makes it even worse is the systematic manner in which they continue to be prevented from returning.\nMr President,\nCOVID-19 has completely disrupted our activities for the past 6 months. We have been unable to have regular in-person meetings, hence our inability to pursue efficiently the implementation of Resolution 73/295. We will, therefore, have to attend to this forcefully and effectively as soon as the situation permits.\nWe are nonetheless thankful to the Secretary-General for his report and the UN Secretariat for amending the UN world map to reflect the correct appurtenance of the Chagos Archipelago as part of the territory of Mauritius.\nI would also like to express our gratitude to all the Member States and organizations for their continued support to the completion of the decolonization process of Mauritius.\nAs regards Tromelin which also forms an integral part of the territory of Mauritius, we look forward to the early resolution of the dispute over the island,in the spirit of friendship that characterizes the relations between Mauritius and France.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nExcellencies Heads of State and Government,\nLadies and Gentlemen Heads of Delegations, Ladies, Gentlemen,\nAt the outset, Mr. President, I should like to extend my warm congratulations to you on your election as President of this 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly. I have no doubt that your personal attributes, your long and rich experience and your leadership constitute important assets that will enable the General Assembly to make progress in fulfilling the mandate entrusted to it by member States. I can assure you of the Niger\u2019s readiness to provide you with all of the support you require in carrying out your duties.\nI would also like to pay a deserved tribute to the outgoing president, Mr. Tijjani Muhammad Bande, for his leadership in steering the 74th session, which was marked, as we all know, by the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic situation.\nFinally, I would like to congratulate Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for the exemplary work he has accomplished in making our Organization more capable of meeting people\u2019s needs for greater solidarity, security and development, through the promotion of multilateralism. I commend his leadership in dealing with the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis, in particular his strong advocacy in favour of developing countries. He has shown courage in implementing reforms. The Niger appreciates his personal commitment to a global ceasefire as a result of COVID-19 and his initiatives for climate and stability in the Sahel and West Africa.\nMr. President,\nSince 1 January 2020, the Niger has been a non-permanent member of the Security Council, which it is presiding over during this month of September.\nI would like to thank member States for this mark of confidence and esteem in my country. We are working with members of the Council and with all other members of the United Nations to promote international peace and security.\nThe General Assembly is certainly the best place to communicate with the international community directly. That is why I take this opportunity to solemnly announce that this is the last time I will speak as President of the Republic of the Niger. The next presidential election to be held in December in my country will be an opportunity for Nigeriens to choose their new leader. This deadline fills me with pride, in the knowledge that this is the very first time in its history that the Niger will experience a democratic transfer of power.\nThis deadline will be a decisive moment for the Niger as part of its efforts to deepen its democratic process and political maturity. It is similar to other African countries in democratic transition. It is gradually strengthening its democratic institutions and I have no doubt that in the long term our country will leave behind the memories of the trials and tribulations that have characterized its institutional development for so long.\nThis qualitative development is the result of the work carried out during my two mandates. Indeed, from the start of my first mandate, I made respect for constitutional texts and institutions a cardinal virtue of my governance for the renaissance of the Niger. My wish was to see the Niger undergo a transformation across all levels: political, economic and social. The results of ten years of implementing the renaissance programme have been largely positive. We have built roads, electrified villages, developed telecommunications infrastructure, fed Nigeriens thanks to the 3N initiative, \u201cNigeriens Nourishing Nigeriens\u201d, educated and cared for our children, promoted access to water and sanitation and finally, created jobs, especially for young people. Furthermore, despite the threats from terrorist and criminal organizations rocking the Sahel and the Lake Chad basin, we have been able to preserve the integrity of our territory.\nMr. President,\nAt this time of international crisis linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, the theme chosen for our session is more important than ever. Decisions and consensus are expected of the United Nations so that the international community can act in the most effective way to jointly overcome the consequences of the pandemic. Now is the time to act on the Charter\u2019s provisions, which forcefully stipulate that the United Nations was created to serve the people.\nWe should therefore reflect on our common future, 75 years after the creation of the United Nations. It is essential that we take steps to make the UN better able to respond to the challenges facing the world. Democratic governance must be better reflected at the global level. We need a more inclusive multilateralism that is more responsive to developing countries and better reflects the realities of the world today. In this way, we will build a more effective multilateralism together for better global governance. We need to build confidence. We need to develop inclusion and transparency.\nWe must reaffirm our collective commitment to multilateralism. We must return to resolute action in favour of efficiency, representativeness, responsibility and solidarity.\nMr. President,\nThe measures taken by the Nigerien government to tackle the pandemic have enabled us to control its spread while taking the appropriate measures to deal with its socioeconomic impacts. Therefore, our response plan covers both the immediate health response and broader economic and social alleviation measures. Key elements are already being implemented, such as food distribution, two months of free public services for the most vulnerable households and temporary tax relief for the most hard-hit sectors. We are also providing support to the private sector in the form of loan guarantees.\nCOVID-19 is putting great strain on our health-care systems. It is also affecting our responses to combat malaria, tuberculosis and other tropical diseases that are too often neglected. Here I would like to reiterate my call for vaccination for all. In addition to the efforts to make the COVID-19 vaccine available, we must continue to support research into vaccines or improved treatments against diseases such as malaria, cancer, diabetes and the Ebola virus. In this regard, I am delighted that polio has been officially eradicated in Africa. Moreover, this is the place to commend and congratulate the health-care soldiers in the war against COVID19. I know that since 2013, world health worker week is celebrated at the beginning of April each year, at the initiative of the WHO. I propose celebrating an international day of front-line health workers given their role in the fight against COVID-19.\nCOVID-19 must lead us to strengthen our investments in the health system, in particular, care for women and girls. The needs are particularly important on the African continent, where approximately 17% of the world\u2019s population is concentrated, for 1% of global health-care expenditure. It is also important that we rethink the issue of access to medicines because according to figures from the World Health Organization, 42% of medical products sold in Africa are substandard or counterfeit. The coronavirus pandemic reminds us that the global health system remains fragile. Coordinated, decisive and innovative political action, in partnership with the United Nations and other international organizations, is needed to address the COVID-19 pandemic. Defeating COVID-19 means including Africa in the global response based on Africa\u2019s common continental Strategy.\nI would like to commend the efforts of the G20 and the United Nations Secretary-General, as well as other partners, in favour of granting a moratorium on the debt of the most fragile States. In combating the current emergency, our States need financial support, commensurate with the economic crisis they are going through. A simple moratorium on the debt will not be enough, given the challenges that must be met. We must write off the debt altogether, and design and implement a new paradigm to meet the development needs of the poorest countries. \u201cThe difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas as in escaping from old ones\u201d said a prominent economist. This is why it is always after shocks that the world reforms. The current paradigm dates from the aftermath of the two oil shocks of 1973 and 1979. Its unchallenged domination has led people to think that it is the end of the story. But it has produced such inequalities that the world is, in this area, in the same situation as at the end of the 19th century. It was thought that the 2008 financial crisis would be an opportunity for its reform: that did not happen. Could the shock of COVID-19 provide another opportunity? I deeply hope so. This shock should be an opportunity to open the debate, including on questions that currently seem utopian such as those relating to the global tax on capital to fight against inequalities, basic universal income to combat poverty, reducing working hours to fight unemployment, and even opening up borders to better support the growth of the world economy. Some think that these are dreams. Putting an end to slavery, the emancipation of women, universal suffrage \u2014 these were also once considered dreams.\nMr. President,\nTo meet the aspirations of the African peoples as contained in Agenda 2063, I have steered on behalf of my African peers since 2017, a new dynamic of regional integration by operationalizing the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), whose operational phase was launched on 7 July 2019 in Niamey. The AfCFTA will enable Africa to set up a single market in order to support economic growth and create prosperity, in particular through creating jobs for young people, with 10 to 12 million currently entering the labour market each year.\nAfrica\u2019s growth and development looked promising at the start of 2020. Growth was expected to rise from 2.9% in 2019 to 3.2% in 2020 and 3.5% in 2021. Significant progress was being made in poverty reduction and health indicators. COVID-19 has shattered that impetus and many of our countries will be in recession. Before COVID-19, Africa needed 600 billion dollars a year to achieve the SDGs. This figure will certainly be reassessed upwards. The pandemic therefore requires that we strengthen bilateral, regional and interregional partnerships. It calls for developing better coordination both with United Nations agencies and international financial institutions. The time has come to further strengthen the links between peace, security in the broadest sense and development. This is about coming together in the face of a global state of emergency that is as much related to health, the economy, society and climate as it is security.\nThe Niger is convinced that the many threats to international peace and security cannot be resolved by individual States, but by the collective action of the international community. In this regard, I would like to pay tribute to the valiant peacekeepers and elements from our defence and security forces alongside whom they fell in the field of honour, particularly in the Sahel and in the Lake Chad basin. We welcome the strengthening of the operational and intelligence capacities of the defence and security forces at the national level, the operationalization of the Mixed Multinational Force (FMM) in the Lake Chad Basin and that of the G5 Sahel Joint Force. With regard to providing sustainable funding to the latter, I welcome the proposal of our Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, drawing on inspiration from the model of the African Union mission in Somalia (AMISOM). Furthermore, the creation of the coalition to fight terrorism in the Sahel, the establishment of a joint command for all the participating military forces including Barkhane and Takuba, the upcoming deployment by the African Union of a contingent of 3,000 men, the initiatives of ECOWAS, are all elements that give us hope of victory over our common enemy: terrorism and organized crime. Here I express our concern about the evolution of the situation in Mali, especially following the coup d\u2019etat in the country on 18 August.\nThe Niger and the other ECOWAS countries are fully committed to finding solutions to put an end to the crisis in Mali. This requires that the military return to their barracks and a transition be led by civilian authorities. In Mali, and throughout the G5 Sahel area, we need multilateralism in order to pursue the fight against terrorism in all its forms, taking due account of the role of women and young people, because it is on the breeding ground for the poverty that terrorism thrives. Children are among the first victims of the terrorist attacks targeting schools in the Central Sahel region where thousands of children are deprived of education. However, our region did not create these evils. They were imposed on it. Our region is a victim. In other words, the security threat falling on the Sahel is not just a local issue but a global concern. The efforts of the Sahel States must therefore be adequately supported both bilaterally and multilaterally. Here I would also like to commend the sacrifices made by aid workers. I know that they are protected by resolution 2175 of 2014, but this protection must be strengthened.\nA follow-up mechanism must be put in place for the disclosure of information and the implementation of sanctions related to attacks against humanitarian workers.\nMr. President,\nSince the Abidjan summit, the partnership between Africa and Europe has been part of a new dynamic enabling the two continents to jointly set their priorities. It was based on this innovative and more inclusive approach that the UN-AU-EU trilateral group was established to address the plight of African migrants in detention centres in Libya.\nHere I would like to reaffirm the Niger\u2019s solidarity with the brotherly Libyan people, who have been subjected to untold suffering for more than ten years. It is regrettable that the initially promising conclusions of the Berlin Conference under the leadership of Chancellor Merkel have not been respected by those who adopted them. In seeking a solution to this crisis, the role of the African Union and the countries neighbouring Libya should not be overlooked. We are eagerly awaiting the convening of an inter-Libyan National Reconciliation Conference with a view to achieving a political solution to this crisis. We hope to see the appointment of a joint UN-AU special envoy for Libya.\nElsewhere around the world, including the situations in Syria, Burma, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen and the Middle East region, the Niger actively participates in the international community\u2019s efforts to ensure peace and security for populations.\nOn the Palestinian question, the Niger believes that the lasting settlement of this issue necessarily requires talks between Israel and Palestine based on fair and unanimously accepted terms, that is to say a solution between the two States, Israel and Palestine, living side-by-side in peace and security, in strict respect of the 1967 borders, and in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council. In this time of pandemic, we express our solidarity with the Palestinian people by supporting UNRWA in its work for the benefit of the vulnerable Palestinian populations. We extend this solidarity to all countries in crisis. That is why we support the call of the United Nations Secretary-General for a suspension or lifting of unilateral coercive measures that may hinder the ability of states to effectively combat the COVID-19 pandemic and meet the needs of their populations.\nMr. President,\nCOVID-19 calls on us to decide the world we want. What post-COVID-19 world do we want to create? What relationship do we want to have with our planet? The answers to these questions are, as I mentioned earlier, of a health, economic, humanitarian and political nature. The Niger loses approximately one hundred thousand (100,000) hectares of arable land each year, putting our populations in a situation of food insecurity. It is therefore necessary to protect the land and the ecosystem essential to human life. The time has come to create a new social contract for nature on a global scale. To better recover from the crisis, we must align our exit strategies with the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals and create a sustainable and inclusive economy by reducing the risk of future shocks.\nOur lifestyles and means of consumption have a significant impact on the planet and on the use of resources. It is imperative that we change them. This is why in Africa we are working within the framework of the Climate Commission for the Sahel region, which I have the honour of chairing, for the implementation of the Paris Agreement on the continent. It is in this spirit that we have drawn up a Global Climate Investment Plan for the Sahel region covering the period 2018-2030 which now constitutes a tool to operationalize the implementation of the Paris Agreement in the region. Likewise, the Great Green Wall Initiative also enables us to build a more sustainable and equitable future and to realize our vision of land degradation neutrality. By preserving the health of our lands and promoting solutions based on respect for nature, we are also preserving the health of our peoples.\nMr. President,\nA century ago, when the Spanish flu hit a world torn apart by the Great War, few multilateral institutions existed. Countries today have fought the pandemic in ways that did not previously exist and have learned a lot. Today, the World Health Organization has become the most relevant multilateral framework at our disposal to deal with epidemics in a concerted manner. Other multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are all tools to enhance our collective capacity to solve global problems.\nWe urge member States to support the Secretary-General\u2019s efforts to reform the Organization, strengthen its role and provide it with the means to enable it to adequately fulfil its missions. The Niger reiterates once again its commitment to the common African position as expressed through the Ezulwini consensus. The multilateral system arising from the Second World War allowed us to define and implement standards and principles based on human development. Today, respect for the individual, the defence of freedoms and the fight against poverty and epidemics are priorities of the global multilateral system.\nBeyond institutional reforms, it is also within our societies that this fight is won, by profoundly changing our behaviour and our policies. We need to invent an economy that respects people and the environment.\nMr. President,\nThe 75th Anniversary of the United Nations is an opportunity to reflect on how to make it even more capable of meeting new challenges. We must preserve the gains generated by multilateralism and reinforce them. If the international system continues to be perceived as unjust and unequal, if we do not ensure the rule of law over the use of force, if we do not respond to the needs of our citizens, then the factors of instability will multiply and the manifestation of ideological hostility to global governance and democratic models will flourish. The multilateral world we want cannot be based exclusively on the balance of power among the great powers. This is perhaps the most important lesson, Mr. President, that the COVID-19 crisis will have taught us. With this in mind, I would like to recall the words of Dag Hammarskjold who said that the United Nations was not created to take mankind to heaven, but to save humanity from hell. Today we need a more agile, more democratic, more coordinated and more effective United Nations, leading us towards a more secure, inclusive and sustainable world.\nIn conclusion, I would like to take inspiration from Thucydides\u2019 famous phrase: \u201cWe deserve praise, for paying more attention to justice than compelled to do by our power\u201d. Being fairer also means doing everything to avoid falling into the eponymous trap in order to protect humanity from a global confrontation with irreparable consequences. We need to find a new global balance. This is the opportunity that COVID19 has given us.\nI thank you for your kind attention."

        "file_text": "President,\nExcellencies,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nThe United Nations General Assembly meets this year in a virtual format, in the shadow of COVID-19. The pandemic has taken an immense toll on our countries, our citizens, our economies, indeed on our entire way of life.\nIt has imposed a particular burden on those least able to bear it: countries with weak healthcare systems, and civilian populations suffering from insecurity, displacement, conflict and poverty.\nThe pandemic has also revealed the best of humanity \u2014 the heroic efforts of our front-line workers to provide care and essential services to those directly affected; the remarkable social cohesion, solidarity and civic responsibility of people throughout the world through many months of restrictions and disruptions to lives and livelihoods.\nMr. President,\nThe pandemic reminds us that multilateral responses to global challenges remain essential. The reality is that we are interconnected and interdependent. Even the strongest of us cannot succeed alone.\nThis is the guiding spirit of the United Nations since its foundation. The same unwavering commitment to working together underpinned Ireland\u2019s candidature for a seat on the United Nations Security Council.\nWe are humbled and honoured that you, the members of the General Assembly, have placed your trust in us.\nYou elected Ireland because you believed that we could make a real contribution on the core mandate of the Security Council; the maintenance of international peace and security.\nI promise that we will do everything we can to fulfil that trust.\nIt is sobering to consider that, since Ireland last served on the Security Council in 2001 and 2002, the number of issues on the Council\u2019s agenda has tripled.\nViolent conflict and insecurity continue to grow.\nWe face enduring global challenges: hunger and food insecurity; the existential threat of climate change; violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, and impunity for perpetrators.\nThe Security Council can, and must, play a central role in addressing them.\nWe are under no illusions. Deep divisions exist on the Council. But we do not accept that these divisions mean that the Council can step back from its responsibilities. It must fulfil the role entrusted to it by the UN Charter and by the member states.\nMr President,\nIreland joins the Council with firm principles and clear priorities.\nThree principles will underpin our approach: Building Peace, Strengthening Prevention, and Ensuring Accountability. These are at the heart of the Council\u2019s mandate.\nBuilding peace means ensuring that we promote sustainable, durable solutions to conflict. A key aspect of this is peacekeeping. Ireland has a long-standing and proud record of continuous service on UN peacekeeping operations.\nAs a member of the Council, we will take a keen interest in shaping the mandates under which UN peacekeepers serve. We want to change aspects of peacekeeping for the better, for both peacekeepers and host communities.\nIn line with the Secretary-General\u2019s Action for Peacekeeping initiative, peacekeeping operations must be adequately resourced, have access to appropriate training and be sensitive to local needs.\nA commitment to upholding human rights and gender equality must be at the heart of all missions.\nWe also need to become much better at linking peacekeeping to peacebuilding, ensuring continued and sustained support for countries emerging from conflict.\nPeacekeeping is a vital task; it saves lives and prevents conflict. But, as Secretary-General Guterres has frequently said, we need durable solutions to the causes of conflict.\nIn Ireland, we have had our own experience of conflict. We know that conflict resolution is a long and complex task. It is rarely smooth or linear. It takes commitment and belief.\nThe voices of women, young people and civil society must be central. Peace processes cannot succeed unless women are fully involved.\nMr President,\nRegional organisations such as the European Union and the African Union are making an increasingly important contribution to how the UN responds to international crises.\nIreland is proud to play an active role in UN-mandated, EU led military crisis management missions and in EU civilian missions. Irish troops, police officers, judges, coastguards, experts in rule of law and security sector reform serve in UN, EU and OSCE missions around the world, from Mali to Lebanon to Ukraine.\nWe actively support African-led operations, both peacekeeping and preventative diplomacy missions, including through the African Union and IGAD, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development.\nStrengthening prevention is also vital. The UN needs to deploy all its resources \u2014 country teams, special representatives, political missions, mediators and more \u2014 to intervene early; to highlight and stop human rights abuses; to prevent conflict and to support the efforts of local stakeholders in peacemaking and peacebuilding.\nCrucially, we must address the factors underlying conflict, including insecurity, hunger, poor governance, climate change, violations of human rights, and the proliferation of small arms and light weapons.\nWe have heard the argument that issues like climate, hunger and human rights do not belong in the Security Council. That there are other fora to discuss these issues. That they do not belong in discussions of international peace and security.\nLet me be very clear. We reject that argument.\nIt is not a case of either/or.\nWe know that climate change not only impedes sustainable development but also contributes to conflict.\nWe know that human rights abuses and the denial of justice can fuel radicalisation and extremism.\nWe know that poverty, hunger and resource deprivation fuel insecurity and violence.\nWe know that rising oceans pose an existential threat to some Small Island Developing States.\nWe know that without a firm commitment to supporting the poorest and most vulnerable countries on their development pathways, we will never adequately address insecurity and conflict. This drives Ireland\u2019s commitment to reach our official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of GNI by 2030.\nWe have ample evidence of these trends.\nWhat we do not yet have is a Security Council ready and able to take on its responsibilities to address these issues. Ireland will do everything possible over the next two years to make all the progress we can.\nAccountability will also be a watchword of our term on the Council.\nIreland stands firmly in support of the International Criminal Court. The Court has a unique and vital mission to ensure that those responsible for the most serious crimes of international concern cannot act with impunity. We are deeply concerned by any measures taken against the Court, and against its officials and staff.\nIreland remains firmly committed to upholding universal human rights, the dignity of all, and providing support to those who promote and defend human rights in the most difficult situations.\nHumanitarian workers must be able to work safely while helping the most vulnerable.\nThe Security Council also has its own responsibility to prevent mass atrocity crimes. We strongly support the ACT Code of Conduct, which pledges Council members to act to prevent such crimes, as well as the French-Mexican initiative on restricting the use of the veto.\nWe have seen the veto repeatedly abused over recent years, to prevent the Council from taking necessary actions, including on access to vital humanitarian relief and in response to the use of chemical weapons in Syria.\nThis speaks to the wider need to reform the Council.\nThe longer the Council goes unreformed, and the longer African countries in particular are denied their rightful level of representation, the greater the threat to the legitimacy of the Council itself.\nAccountability also extends to failures to respect the Resolutions of the Security Council. States cannot unilaterally decide which aspects of international law to adhere to, and which to set aside when politically inconvenient.\nMr President,\nThe Council has a large number of country situations on its agenda.\nFrom Syria, to Libya, to Yemen, our approach will be driven by a profound concern for protecting citizens and improving humanitarian conditions.\nWe will support efforts for peace in Afghanistan, in which the rights of women must be included and respected.\nWe will also work tirelessly to promote tangible progress towards a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.\nSecurity Council resolutions set out recognised international parameters for an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. These are reflected in the General Assembly resolution Ireland introduced in 2018, and balance the legitimate rights and responsibilities of both sides. As an international community, we need to create the space for direct negotiations.\nIreland has long championed disarmament and non proliferation.\nWe played an important role in negotiating the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, and are proud to have become the 41st country to ratify it, this year. Nuclear proliferation must remain at the heart of the Council\u2019s work.\nThe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea must abandon all nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programmes in a complete, verifiable, and irreversible manner.\nThe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme must be implemented in full \u2014 it is the most effective mechanism for preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons.\nIran must also end destabilizing activities in the region, to create a context for an alternative future of economic cooperation and development.\nPeace and security in Africa, a key focus of the Council, has been an important priority for Ireland since the deployment of Irish UN peacekeepers to the Congo 60 years ago.\nOn the Council, we will actively support peace and democratic progress in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, the Central African Republic, Somalia, Sudan and South Sudan.\nWe will also carefully consider plans for the drawdown of some peacekeeping missions, ensuring there are no \u2018cliff edge\u2019 departures; rather, we need comprehensive and inclusive transition plans that safeguard progress towards security and development.\nThe Peacebuilding Commission has an essential role to play in this regard.\nMr President,\nThe Security Council is often criticised for its failure to prevent and resolve conflict.\nSometimes, that criticism is justified.\nBut we must also remember the successes. We have seen, for instance, the significant contribution that the Security Council and the wider UN system made to the peace process in Colombia, including the verification of the laying down of arms, clearance of ordnance, and the reintegration of former combatants.\nPeacekeeping missions such as UNIFIL and UNDOF \u2014 both of which have strong Irish participation - provide vital stability in volatile regions.\nNumerous peace agreements around the world have been brokered by the UN, with the active support of the Security Council.\nBut we need to see more concrete outcomes, more often.\nThat is what the Security Council was created to do. We must build the trust and political will necessary to achieve progress in even the most intractable conflicts.\nMy primary focus today has been on Ireland\u2019s forthcoming membership of the Security Council.\nBut we are at all times cognizant that the United Nations is a far broader and deeper entity. The UN\u2019s work on human rights, international development, disarmament, trade and economic cooperation, terrorism and crime, the use of technology and safety of cyberspace, remains critical.\nWe need to see full achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, Agenda 2030 and Agenda 2063.\nWe must continue to support an effective, coherent multilateral response to Covid-19. The guidance and global coordination efforts by the World Health Organisation have been crucial. And Ireland is proud to be part of the European Union\u2019s unprecedented global response, including support to the COVAX Facility, which will ensure developing countries have access to vaccines.\nMr President,\nThe United Nations is not one monolithic body. The United Nations is all of its 193-member states; it is us.\nSmall states such as Ireland depend on the rules-based international order to survive and to thrive.\nAs a member of the Council, we will tirelessly uphold the primacy of the United Nations and the multilateral system as a whole.\nWe will be guided by the principles of the UN Charter. We will listen. We will work across regional and ideological boundaries. We do not have historical baggage, or special interests. We intend, Mr. President, to make every day count. Thank you."

        "file_text": "In the name of God the Merciful and the Compassionate,\nYour Excellency, President Volkan Bozkir,\nIt is our pleasure at the outset to congratulate you and your friendly country, the Republic of Turkey, on your election as the President of the United Nations General Assembly at its seventy-fifth session. We trust that your skill and wisdom will enable you to efficiently guide the work of our Assembly.\nIt is also our pleasure to express our thanks and appreciation to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande of the friendly Republic of Nigeria, for his efforts while presiding over the previous session.\nThe United Nations marks its seventy-fifth anniversary this year. We take this opportunity to express our thanks and deep appreciation to the United Nations and to His Excellency Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and his team in this international Organization. We thank them for their tireless efforts to maintain international peace and security. We emphasize that the Sultanate of Oman stands ready to continue the current cooperation between us and with all the Member States to achieve the noble objectives of the United Nations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has imposed major changes on our daily lives. Despite the challenges, we must adapt to the new way of life and remain optimistic about the future. We need to envisage the best ways to cooperate in order to achieve the common goals of our peoples and States. In that context, the international community has a humanitarian duty to ensure the fair distribution of resources to curb the spread of the pandemic, in particular the rollout of vaccines in the least developed regions, where medical facilities and capabilities are limited.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused profound economic challenges. We therefore call upon donor nations and institutions to do their utmost to facilitate the process of debt restructuring, while paying special attention to helping the most affected countries in a way that accelerates growth and stimulates the economy.\nHis Majesty Sultan Haitham Bin Tarik has underscored that the Sultanate of Oman will follow the wise policy outlined by His Majesty, the late Sultan Qaboos bin Said A1 Said, the architect of modern Oman and mastermind of its foreign policy and its international relations over the past 50 years. The Sultanate of Oman adopts the path of dialogue and encourages it.\nMy country\u2019s Government supports the values of tolerance, collective action and peaceful coexistence with everyone. We believe in the principles of justice, equality, good-neighbourliness, the rule of law, non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and respect for the sovereignty of countries. We stress the peaceful settlement of disputes, based on the provisions and principles of the United Nations Charter and international law. It is an obligation that we should all honour.\nWhile my country supports the sovereign right of States to determine the actions they deem fit for their national interests, our common interests make it incumbent upon us all to support peace and participate positively in efforts aimed at ensuring that peace prevails as a global culture that fosters progress and prosperity. Accordingly, the Sultanate of Oman reiterates, from this international platform, its support for the legitimate and just demands of the brotherly Palestinian people to establish an independent Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, on the basis of international law, relevant Security Council resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative, which is based on the principle of land for peace and the two-State solution.\nMy country calls on all stakeholders in the Republic of Yemen to join constructive dialogue in order to reach a peaceful and consensus-based solution to the ongoing conflict. We call on all parties to support the efforts of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen. We also call on the international community, in particular donor countries and organizations, to intensify their efforts to provide and deliver humanitarian supplies in the light of the critical situation and tragic suffering of the people of that Arab country.\nWe would like to express our support for the Lebanese Republic. We call on the international community to support Lebanon\u2019s reconstruction efforts and help it grapple with the impact of the recent tragic explosion in the port of Beirut.\nWith regard to Libya, the Sultanate of Oman welcomes the ceasefire agreement and ongoing work to establish a mechanism for the resumption of oil production and export, as well as the management of oil revenues for the benefit of the people of Libya. We hope that they enjoy security, stability and prosperity through the launching of a peaceful settlement that will put an end to division and build harmony and unity among the one people of that country.\nThis year, the Sultanate of Oman has taken important steps to restructure and modernize its administrative apparatus in support of the current phase of economic development within Oman Vision 2020-2040. This is based on the principles of the basic statute of the State. It is worth mentioning that our economic system is guided by the principles of the market economy. Undoubtedly, this will enhance the value of our geographic location and its importance in international trade in the twenty-first century. It is also worth mentioning that my country enjoys political stability, touristic attractions and diverse investment opportunities in various areas and development sectors.\nOman actively participated in the various international and regional forums that resulted in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Sultanate sought to translate its commitments into the key components reflected in its ninth five-year development plan and in Oman Vision 2020-2040. We are determined to continue working to achieve the economic, social and environmental dimensions of the Sustainable Development Goals on time.\nThere is no doubt that the young people of any country represent hope for its present and future and are key to its development. Therefore, Governments must prioritize young people and provide them with the resources necessary to harness their potential and develop their talents in order to ensure sustainable development. In this vein, I note that the Sultanate of Oman pays continuous attention to youth, while keeping pace with developments throughout the world. This will help young people garner greater capabilities, knowledge and active participation in the process of construction and development.\nWe live in a world of continuous and successive transformations that have engendered scientific and technological advancement. If humankind is to prevail in this new world, we will always need to find ways and means of working together better and more effectively to move from one phase to the next.\nIn conclusion, allow me to convey to you our best and most sincere greetings from the Sultanate of Oman and express our best wishes to our brothers and sisters all over the world, wishing them all the best of health and prosperity.\nMay peace and God\u2019s mercy and blessings be upon you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nSecretary-General,\nDistinguished delegates,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nI wish to convey my heartfelt congratulations to you, Mr. President, upon your election as the President of the current session of the General Assembly. I pledge my delegation\u2019s full support and cooperation in the discharge of your onerous responsibilities.\nThis year the member States are proudly celebrating the 75th anniversary of the United Nations. The UN is the optimal structure of multilateral cooperation. It was, indeed, a tremendous achievement when the world\u2019s nations united under the spirit of the UN Charter, set out to resolve their differences and hurdles through negotiations and cooperation.\nAlong with progress and development came complex and formidable challenges. Our responsibility to address and overcome them has equally increased. The most glaring example is the current 75th session of the UN General Assembly, which is taking place amid a worldwide fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn today\u2019s interdependent world, infectious diseases are spreading exponentially, adversely affecting the economy, social welfare, humanitarian causes, security and human rights.\nIt is a huge lesson and warning that humankind has been caught off guard and swept by the pandemic in the 21st century with its highly developed medical science. In this time of hardship, multilateralism has taken on an even more significant role. There is a critical need for networked, inclusive and well-timed responses based on unity and cooperation.\nWe have no doubt that upon release of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine, the United Nations and its system organizations will play a major role in ensuring equal access to the vaccine for developing and least developed countries, as well as vulnerable groups, such as children, women, the elderly and indigenous peoples.\nWe call on international financial organizations and developed countries to continue their support and assistance to developing countries with limited resources and weak social protection systems in their economic recovery and fight against the deadly pandemic.\nMr. President,\nThis year ushered in the Decade of Action to deliver the SDGs. However, it is also the year where COVID-19 restrictions and quarantine are in place worldwide, and the pandemic has not only aggravated the existing challenges, but also reversed some of the hard-won gains made since 2015. Thus, all Governments need to act decisively to fight the pandemic, step up their efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals and fulfill their responsibilities in a more innovative and flexible way.\nAs a result of a timely containment strategy, mobilization of all possible resources while taking into account the lessons learnt from others, Mongolia has so far no local transmission and no pandemic-related death.\nThe pandemic, climate change and other threats that have raised alarm worldwide keep reminding humankind of the overriding need to cherish the Earth and live in harmony with nature. The tradition of treasuring, cherishing and protecting the Earth is deeply embedded in the nomadic way of life and the national identity of Mongols.\nInterdependence between humans and the natural world is at the root of human existence. To this day we have done everything not to bend down under the overwhelming forces of nature. However, our struggle was not to adapt to nature, but rather to defeat it. Day by day we realize that the fight to win is what is causing defeat, while the fight to seek harmony is the foundation of our existence.\nThe fact that Mongolia is one of the few countries with zero local transmission of COVID-19 can be traced to our centuries-long tradition of living in harmony with nature. We need to unite our minds and forces to live in concord with nature, rather than dominate it with the help of technological progress.\nIn fact, nations around the world owe a duty to future generations to protect the Earth and ensure that every individual leads an eco-friendly life.\nMr. President,\nFor the past 75 years, the United Nations has been fulfilling its responsibility of uniting the world\u2019s nations under one roof and steering them towards growth and development. However, the need for the UN to be more in sync with changing environment, enhance its work and change its working methods is nothing but compelling, if it is to rise to the emerging challenges of international relations. It must take even more innovative and bold action to that end.\nLet us joint efforts to build a reinvigorated United Nations and grow together for the sake of Mother Earth and peace and prosperity of all humankind!\nI thank you for attention."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nFor good reason, this is the first time that the high week of the General Assembly\u2019s commemorative session is being held in such an unusual format.\nNaturally, no speaker can ignore the topic of the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe pandemic has affected us all. Moreover, the problem will remain with us, at least for the near future.\nLeading experts and analysts are actively talking about its global consequences and impact on world politics and economy.\nMany assessments speak of \u201cparadigm shifts\u201d and \u201ctectonic changes\u201d.\nPerhaps. Time will tell.\nUnfortunately, the pandemic has made it clear that the \u201cinternational community\u201d that we all talk about so often has, in fact, failed to live up to our expectations at the peak of the crisis.\nThe logic that it is easier to cope with the challenge going it alone has obviously prevailed.\nVirtually everybody returned in droves to their apartments in their countries of origin, closed their borders and stopped contacts with the outside world!\nIn responding to the challenge, Belarus did not follow what it considered to be a dubious path. We did not close down or isolate ourselves.\nWe immediately asked ourselves the question: why have we been promoting globalization and opening ourselves up to one another for the past decades?\nWe initially believed and continue to believe in the success of collective efforts. We relied and continue to rely on the potential of the \u201cinternational community.\nUnfortunately, it has not been without exploitation, whereby some countries have begun to accuse others of allegedly doing the wrong thing in the fight against the pandemic.\nThat is for the simple reason that the \u201cinternational community\u201d has not developed a common approach. It is therefore probably not about the pandemic but about something else.\nIn the current situation, the specific national context became the determining factor in the fight against the coronavirus.\nIn Belarus, we chose our own approach.\nIt was based on two components to optimally preserve the viability of the State, primarily its economy, and ensure the maximum protection of the population.\nOur approach, as the situation in Belarus has shown, paid off. And the situation concerning the spread of the coronavirus disease in the world today fully confirms this.\nThere will be many more assessments and conclusions, but today we can already say with certainty that the outbreak of the coronavirus disease, on the one hand, revealed the urgent need for a \u201cstrong\u201d State and, on the other, clearly showed how interconnected the world is.\nNo country can make real progress in addressing a global issue if others are left behind or on the sidelines.\nTogether we must turn the crisis into an opportunity to improve the world. We must learn to work together.\nThe pandemic has temporarily overshadowed other world problems and conflicts, including those in the area of security, which, unfortunately, are not decreasing.\nIn that regard, during the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations (UN) the end of the Second World War, as a founding member of the United Nations, the Republic of Belarus appeals to Member States, particularly the members of the Security Council, to take special responsibility for the Organization\u2019s operations and the implementation of its tasks.\nIn this context, I would also like to recall one of the outstanding historical figures of the United Nations \u2014 Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former Secretary- General Dag Hammarskjold, whose 115th birthday was commemorated this year. He is considered one of the inspirations and tireless promoters of the concept of preventive diplomacy. Dag Hammarskjold, who died on a crisis management mission in a hotspot, believed that only mutually respectful dialogue and honest negotiations among parties to a potential conflict in its early stages could prevent a war from igniting.\nThis is what the world lacks now.\nWe have forgotten what dialogue is, and, even if we do remember, we have forgotten how to use it.\nI must note that for several years Belarus has been actively calling for the resumption of a broad dialogue on international security, aimed at overcoming the current contradictions in relations among States. Such dialogue would enable a return to building a just and effective global order based on multilateralism.\nAccordingly, Belarus advocates and supports pragmatic initiatives within the UN in order to fully realize the potential of the Organization to maintain international peace and security.\nThis year once again, in the General Assembly and the First Committee, we will propose a draft resolution on banning new weapons of mass destruction, which traditionally enjoys the universal support of virtually every Member States of the Organization. We call on all States to co-sponsor and support the draft resolution.\nIn referring once again to the anniversary of the end of the Second World War, I would like to stress our deep conviction as one of the countries that suffered the greatest losses in it.\nThe tragic lesson of the twentieth century\u2019s worst catastrophe must remain a key component of \u201cherd immunity\u201d to the emergence of new global and regional confrontations.\nAs the Charter of the United Nations states, our Organization was founded precisely to \u201csave succeeding generations from the scourge of war\u201d.\nCooperation based on the principles of the Charter is the only alternative to \u201cnatural selection\u201d and \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d.\nGiven the modern technology and information capabilities available now not only to States, but also non-State actors, we must be fully aware of the risks caused by political, economic and military confrontation, irresponsible competition and the provocation of undesirable countries.\nAnd there is one more important point.\nWe regretfully note the growing attempts by some countries to abuse the UN as a tribune, including the Security Council, to satisfy their narrow political ambitions.\nI am referring to, among other things, the focused attention of certain Western countries on the situation in Belarus, which currently is difficult owing to circumstances imposed on us, from, above all, the outside.\nLet me remind everyone that the people made their decision during the presidential elections in Belarus in August, which was to choose in favour of a stable and prosperous State, peace, good neighbourliness and sustainable development.\nHowever, instead of respecting that choice, we see aspirations to influence the situation in the country.\nSince the failed attempt to impose a \u201ccolour revolution\u201d on us, we have experienced external interference aimed at undermining the State system.\nIndividual statements, bordering on cynicism, by some of our Western neighbours about their alleged concern for Belarus\u2019 sovereignty and welfare are in fact nothing more than attempts to plunge the country into chaos and anarchy, which will set Belarus back in its development by many years.\nWe urge our partners to show wisdom, restraint and impartiality.\nInterference in our internal affairs or sanctions or other restrictive measures against Belarus will have the opposite effect and will harm absolutely everyone. We have already experienced this in the past.\nThe future of the Republic of Belarus will be decided by its own people, as it has been repeatedly demonstrated throughout our country\u2019s history. It will be decided not at the barricades, but through civilized dialogue, including through the process of constitutional reform, which has already begun in the country.\nI would like to stress once again that we firmly reject the practice of any unilateral coercive measures in international relations.\nA vivid example of such actions has been the decades-long trade, financial and economic blockade on Cuba by its northern neighbour \u2014 the United States.\nThe maintenance of these \u201csuffocating\u201d instruments of pressure on sovereign States \u2014 without even considering the situation caused by the coronavirus disease pandemic \u2014 poses a specific threat fraught with lasting repercussions. Trade wars and arbitrary financial and economic sanctions as an instrument of political pressure must stop.\nAnother critical issue is the \u201chealth\u201d of the global economy, which is now in serious trouble. The pandemic threatens to undo all that has been achieved since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nThe urgent need to change approaches to socioeconomic development in the postpandemic era is becoming increasingly clear. Belarus supports proposals to increase investment in health care, infrastructure and education, providing broad access to digital technologies and ensuring the proper management of natural resources.\nWe share in endorsing approaches to boost economic recovery by rethinking the economic model in terms of promoting the \u201cgreen economy\u201d.\nFor its part, Belarus continues to move consistently towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, based on the 2030 Agenda. The country\u2019s efforts are aimed at achieving a balance between economic development and the protection of the environment, while promoting the principles of the green economy, implementing the \u201csmart city\u201d concept and developing precision agriculture. Such work is carried out with the involvement of all stakeholders within the country and in close cooperation with international partners.\nWe see partnering with all stakeholders at both national and international levels as one of the key factors to accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. As a middle-income country, Belarus believes that a separate UN strategy to promote sustainable development \u2014 in line with similar documents for other groups of developing countries \u2014 is necessary for the successful achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals for that category of States.\nIn conclusion, I would like to note a very simple but important life lesson: \u201cEvery cloud has a silver lining\u201d. We have born witness to transformational events.\nIndeed, 2020 has been a special year for the world, forcing us to a restructure the life of humankind. A new history is being written before our eyes \u2014 the world will no longer be the same as it was before. As we learn our lessons, we must not carry past mistakes into the future. We must build a new world \u2014 friendly to people, free from wars and conflicts, stable, predictable and prosperous. A world that will arm itself with the benefits of technological progress and use them for development, not destruction.\nThese days one hears a lot of criticism of the UN. Sometimes it is justified, sometimes it is not.\nThe Republic of Belarus emphatically shares the following message: the Organization must keep pace with the times.\nWe need an effective and efficient UN Security Council that will put an end to numerous wars and armed conflicts, including taking into account the need to preserve territorial integrity and comply with international law.\nWe want to see a more active General Assembly \u2014 making timely important decisions on the entire spectrum of pressing world problems.\nWe are all interested in seeing the Economic and Social Council, like the entire UN development system, provide more effective assistance to States in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals.\nRenewed with time, the Organization will remain needed by all people on the planet.\nThe Republic of Belarus is a signatory country to the UN Charter, assuming responsibility for promoting the implementation of the main goals of the Organization. Our country will continue to work for the preservation and development of the creative and unifying principle of the UN."

        "file_text": "President of the General Assembly Secretary-General,\nHeads of State and Government,\nHeads of Delegation Ladies and Gentlemen,\nTrust - Responsibility - Commitment\nThese are the three pillars that influence mutual aid and cooperation among our various countries: effective multilateralism.\nThese are the three values that are needed to safeguard this multilateralism and about which I would like to speak to you today.\nTHE PANDEMIC MUST SERVE AS AN EYE OPENER\nIndeed, 2020 will be recalled as a painful year. The COVID-19 pandemic took us by surprise. Each of our States faced an unprecedented crisis.\nThe virus claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. It shattered many families around the world. Its economic impact is also considerable.\nBut, in our minds, it has also led to uncertainty and questions about the future.\nYet, we should not be blinded by COVID-19. On the contrary, it should open our eyes to the shortcomings that have been exposed in our models of society, for example.\nWe must acknowledge the negative and disproportionate effects of the pandemic on those who suffer disproportionately from inequalities: women and girls, children, older persons and people with disabilities. No one should be left by the wayside.\nNOT TO MENTION OTHER CHALLENGES\nExcellencies,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nWhile we continue to combat the pandemic and its consequences with vigour and determination, we cannot turn our backs on the other major challenges of the twenty-first century.\nGeopolitical tensions are palpable and conflicts are under way or loom in various corners of the globe. The health crisis only exacerbates these tensions.\nThey threaten the fragile balance of our world.\nThese conflicts are never inevitable.\nFurthermore, they always have a devastating impact on populations...\nThe situation in the Gulf, for example, remains a source of serious concern and calls for the utmost prudence.\nThe JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) remains crucial to ensuring that Iran\u2019s nuclear programme is used exclusively for peaceful purposes. We must actively preserve this agreement and the non-proliferation regime.\nThe issue of the upcoming lifting of the conventional weapons embargo must not jeopardize the nuclear agreement and its achievements. This is a top priority for the region and its stability, international security and the global non-proliferation architecture.\nIn the Middle East, prospects for just and lasting peace remain the goal. There can be no peace in the Middle East without a permanent and just solution to the Palestinian question.\nNor can there be peace in the Middle East without Israel\u2019s legitimate right to live in peace and security within internationally recognized borders.\nThere can be no peace in the Middle East without the eradication of terrorism.\nYes, the suspension of plans to formalize the annexation of parts of the occupied Palestinian territories is a step in the right direction.\nBut no, it is not enough. These plans must be abandoned once and for all. Annexation would seriously undermine the viability of a lasting solution and close the door to future negotiations.\nWe welcome recent announcements about the normalization of Israel\u2019s relations with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. We must view this as a sign of hope that it can be a cornerstone of peace and stability in the entire region.\nThat said, international and multilateral efforts aimed at a meaningful resumption of talks must be actively supported to enable a negotiated and viable two-State solution based on international law and United Nations resolutions.\nThe security situation in much of the Sahel remains a matter of serious concern, despite numerous efforts and increased international mobilization.\nFollowing a coup de force led by mutinous members of the Malian armed forces, Mali\u2019s legal and constitutional order was challenged.\nThe legitimate demands, aspirations and frustrations of Malian citizens, who await solutions to the many challenges facing their country, should not be met in this way. We support all regional and inter-Malian efforts to establish as soon as possible a civil transition process in Bamako that will allow a return to constitutional order.\nMany of Mali\u2019s challenges are common to the entire region.\nTerrorism, conflicts between pastoralists and farmers and inter-community tensions pose severe security threats.\nA holistic approach is needed to combat violent extremism, while underscoring good governance, the fight against impunity, the strengthening of democratic institutions, a response to the grievances of marginalized groups and sustainable and inclusive development.\nAt the same time, an ever-increasing number of regions of the world experience the health, security and humanitarian implications of climate change and the degradation of biodiversity.\nDrought and erratic weather conditions drive people from their homes, whether in Somalia, Yemen or Afghanistan. Melting polar ice is leading to the militarization of the Arctic.\nThe impact of climate change underscores the social, political, economic and environmental causes of conflict.\nThe climate emergency is a challenge to peace. There is no more time to waste.\nThis cause must be a concern for us all.\nThe Sustainable Development Goals and, more generally, the 2030 Agenda are essential tools for responding to the global challenges we face \u2014 be they poverty, inequality and climate and environmental degradation.\nEFFECTIVE MULTILATERALISM AS A RESPONSE\nExcellencies,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nIn the light of these global challenges, we must act.\nAnd admit that we cannot do it alone.\nNone of the common challenges I have mentioned can be addressed in isolation. None of these complex problems have simple solutions.\nWe have no choice but to join forces, even if it means reimagining the obvious or even changing our paradigms. But always in accordance with the principles of the Charter.\nMultilateralism does not work on the basis of its essence; it works because there is a common will to make it work.\nIf this makes the task of those who take action difficult and the task of those who reflect easier, so be it. But let us not engage in the wrong fight.\nIt is when its relevance is questioned that multilateralism reveals its indispensable nature.\nToday, more than ever, we need effective multilateralism.\nNever as an objective in itself.\nBut always as a means to address the problems of which we are all part, in one way or another.\nAs a means to prevent crises head-on.\nThrough trust, responsibility and commitment.\nTRUST\nExcellencies,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nWhen I say trust, I mean trust in ourselves \u2014 trust in our individual and collective capacities, as demonstrated in our health-care services, to fight the pandemic.\nTrust in our courage, resilience, knowledge and responsible behaviour, in combination with our scientific progress, to mitigate climate change.\nTrust in our commitment to achieving sustainable development for all.\nThe international community has already overcome major challenges and we will do so again. Resignation is not an option.\nWhen I speak of trust, I also mean mutual trust. Such trust forces us all to keep our word. It makes us maintain constant dialogue and put ourselves in each other\u2019s shoes.\nWhen we do not, or no longer do so, mistrust sets in and, sooner or later, makes the necessary cooperation too difficult or even impossible.\nWhen I say trust, I mean good governance at the national, regional and international levels in order to gain the trust of citizens.\nGood governance built on the foundation of the rule of law, democracy, accountability and full respect for human rights.\nWhen I say trust, I mean trust in justice \u2014 justice that must be built on the unshakeable conviction that all individuals are equal and that no form of discrimination can alter that fact.\nRESPONSIBILITY\nExcellencies,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nTrust, responsibility, commitment.\nAs the United Nations, we have a responsibility to make global governance work. We contribute in various ways and at various levels, but every Member can benefit. We are the United Nations.\nAs such, we share the responsibility for making multilateralism work and to show its added value.\nThat is why we fully support Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019 continued efforts to reform the UN.\nReform for greater efficiency, greater transparency and greater responsiveness and adaptability.\nWe also reaffirm our full support for peacekeeping action. This is our recognition of the need to safeguard one of the most important instruments of the international community to support political processes, protect hundreds of thousands of civilians and help enforce ceasefires.\nMaking global governance and multilateralism work also means not hindering the functioning of its existing bodies.\nTherefore, Belgium reaffirms its firm support for the ICC, an essential body in the fight against impunity for the most serious crimes that affect the entire international community. As an independent and impartial institution, the Court plays an indispensable role in this area. Accountability also means taking ownership of challenges so that we move from identifying them to taking action to address them. That is our responsibility to our contemporaries, but also, and above all, to our children and the next generations. That brings me to my next point \u2014 commitment.\nCOMMITMENT / WHAT BELGIUM IS DOING\nThe commitment to multilateralism is part of my country\u2019s DNA.\nPerhaps it is because it is not foreign to our history; our tradition of compromise.\nInternational rules protect us.\nCooperation and our close relations have strengthened us.\nEffective multilateralism allows us to punch above our weight. In this process, we, large and small, all have a voice and added value around the table.\nCommitment is what helped Belgium obtain its sixth mandate in the UN Security Council.\nAs an elected Council member for 2019 and 2020, we continue to discharge our duty to advance peace and security daily.\nIn doing so, we recognize that the Security Council is not immune to geopolitical tensions. We see an imperfect body. We see 15 States that are not always able to resolve all conflicts.\nHowever, we also see that the majority of decisions are unanimous.\nThe increased cooperation among the elected members is inspiring.\nThe steps taken to discuss new security threats, such as climate change, are encouraging.\nTransitional justice is another area in which the United Nations can demonstrate ambition \u2014 for a comprehensive human rights-based approach, the centrality of justice and accountability.\nThese are all aspirations, which require coordination among the various national and international actors. Belgium contributes to achieving them and will continue to engage.\nCommitment is also the driving force behind my country\u2019s contribution to development cooperation and humanitarian aid.\nThis is what prompted Belgium to provide multi-year support to UNRWA \u2014 making our country one of its largest donors \u2014 to improve the lives of Palestinian refugees.\nBelgium\u2019s commitment is also reflected in its position as one of the main European donors to Yemen.\nWe also support UNICEF\u2019s efforts to enable it to monitor children\u2019s rights in conflicts.\nBelgium\u2019s commitment is reflected in its predictable direct multi-year funding to United Nations organizations active in the area of development. This allows for long-term action and an adequate response to the many crises.\nThrough its constant commitment to the work and strategic objectives of UN- Women, whose tenth anniversary we mark this year, my country is working towards the systematic integration of the gender dimension in its efforts. This is a cardinal principle of our foreign policy. That is why we believe in and endorse the work of Dr. Denis Mukwege in support of women who are victims of sexual violence in eastern Congo.\nFurthermore, our armed forces are also committed. They are commitment to the fight against the threat of terrorism and to the Global Coalition Against Da\u2019esh.\nThey are committed to participating in multilateral peace missions in Mali and Afghanistan, under the auspices of the UN, the European Union and NATO.\nLastly, a strong and solid Organization must be able to rely on the resources that its sovereign Member States decide to allocate to it.\nBelgium is committed to continuing its efforts to ensure that the UN has the necessary resources for conducting its work in time \u2014 an indispensable component of effective multilateralism.\nCONCLUSION\nExcellencies,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nAs we celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the UN, under very special circumstances, we must not allow ourselves to be pessimistic.\nLet us stand up. Let us face the challenges ahead and build on past achievements.\nIn the coming weeks, we will celebrate 20 years of progress in the women and peace and security agenda and the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Beijing Platform.\nThese are multilateral achievements in the global policy framework for women\u2019s rights. These are two concrete examples of what we can do together to improve the lives of half of the world\u2019s population. It matters. This is a project on which there is still much progress to be made.\nThese are but a few examples, but they matter.\nBecause they remind us that multilateralism can work. They remind us of the many benefits of effective multilateralism.\nLet us therefore support it.\nWithout hesitation.\nWith trust, responsibility and commitment.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President of the General Assembly,\nExcellencies,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nThis year we are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the foundation of the United Nations, which was born out of the ashes of the Second World War. We remember the sacrifice of our grandparents, their tribulations for peace and the future of humankind.\nToday is the first time ever the UN General Assembly is being held in a virtual format. No matter how uncomfortable and undesirable it is, the meeting in this format proves the determination of humankind to continue cooperation, it shows our dedication and commitment to the UN and multilateral cooperation.\nIndeed, the pandemic has an unprecedented impact on all aspects of human life. Addressing global challenges requires recommitment of all states to effective multilateralism and international cooperation with the central role of the United Nations.\nWe appreciate the primary role of the UN, in particular the World Health Organization and the UNDP, in the global response to COVID-19. We are grateful to all our partner countries who supported Armenia and on our part, we extended our share of help to our friends. This collective effort is an important manifestation of international solidarity.\nIn the spirit of our collective pledge to leave no one behind, we share the conviction that equitable access to all essential health technologies and products to combat the virus is a global priority, and no one, including those living in conflict areas, should be denied or be limited in access to remedies to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.\nLikewise, vaccines against COVID-19 are a global public good and should be accessible and affordable to all peoples without any discrimination.\nI want to once again stress Armenia\u2019s unequivocal support to the Secretary- General\u2019s appeal for a global ceasefire and UN Security Council Resolution 2532 (2020) on COVID-19, demanding general and immediate cessation of hostilities in all situations.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nWhile global efforts were directed at coping with COVID-19, we have been witnessing deplorable attempts to destabilize peace and security in our region. This July Azerbaijan ventured yet another act of aggression. The armed forces of Azerbaijan initiated a military offensive in the borderline Tavush region of Armenia.\nAs Armenia had called for an immediate de-escalation and agreed to end hostilities of hours after their outbreak, Azerbaijan continued targeting civilian population and infrastructure, and attacking Armenia\u2019s borderline areas by employing artillery, heavy weaponry, UAV\u2019s, and large infantry units. Moreover, the Azerbaijani authorities had also escalated their war threats, which crossed all the imaginable boundaries of a civilized world. Azerbaijan\u2019s Ministry of Defense even threatened to launch a missile strike at the Nuclear Power Plant in Armenia, which is tantamount to a threat of \u201cnuclear terrorism\u201d.\nThe July battles shattered the myth of Azerbaijan\u2019s military superiority and validated the obvious that there is no military solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. It is long overdue for the Azerbaijani leadership to acknowledge this fact and renounce the use of force and threat of force in the context of the conflict resolution.\nArmenia reaffirms its commitment to the exclusively peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The right of self-determination of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh is a basis of the peace process, which is recognized by the international community and the international mediators, the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs, in particular. By virtue of this right, the people of Nagorno-Karabakh should be able to determine their status without limitation. To this end, their elected authorities should be able to take part in the negotiations. The aspirations and needs of people living in the conflict zone should become the priority of the negotiation agenda.\nEnsuring comprehensive security of the people of Artsakh who have been exposed to existential physical security threats is another key priority for Armenia.\nFreedom, democracy and respect for basic human rights are integral requisites of an environment conducive to achieving a lasting and comprehensive settlement of the conflict. Only legitimately elected governments can genuinely express the interests of their people and move towards a compromise. The authorities of Azerbaijan have been consistently using the conflict for legitimizing their long grip on power. For decades, Armenia and the Armenians have been useful enemies for the leadership of Azerbaijan to justify low living standards, the absence of democracy and systematic violations of human rights in their country.\nThe ceasefire must be strengthened by concrete actions on the ground. Renouncing bellicose rhetoric and hate speech, expanding OSCE monitors on the line of contact and the borders, establishing an investigative mechanism into ceasefire violations and setting up direct communication lines between commanders on the ground are essential in this regard.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nDuring the July escalation, calls from the international community were mostly about the respect of the ceasefire, dialogue and restraint. Turkey, however, much in line with its destabilizing policies of power projection in its other neighboring regions, including the East Mediterranean, North Africa and the Middle East, spared no effort to fuel tensions in the South Caucasus, as well. With its unilateral support to Azerbaijan and the expansion of military presence there, Turkey undermines efforts to peace and stability in the region, as well as the efforts of the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs to this end. Turkey directly threatens Armenia and puts on show aggressive military posturing by way of provocative joint military drills with Azerbaijan in close vicinity of Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh. Turkey builds its policies in our region on traditions of kinship, on exploiting conflicts, on the justification of the Armenian Genocide and on the impunity for that crime. Turkey poses a security threat to Armenia and the region. In this context, Armenia will continue to actively engage in regional and international efforts to maintain peace and security through dialogue and cooperation.\nExcellencies,\nDespite the challenges we have been facing this year, Armenia continues its engagement with international operations of preserving international peace and security. Armenian peacekeepers serving in Lebanon, Mali, Kosovo, and Afghanistan have contributed to the security and stability there. We are ready to expand our participation in peacekeeping operations under the auspices of the UN.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nArmenia prioritizes the effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nOn July 10, 2020, Armenia presented its Second Voluntary National Review (VNR) of the Sustainable Development Goals. The theme of this year\u2019s High-Level Political forum \u2014 Accelerated action and transformative pathways \u2014 perfectly reflects Armenia\u2019s national priorities and policies of the past two years since the non-violent Velvet Revolution in 2018.\nPowered with the strong popular mandate, our Government is very determined to advance ambitious reforms, aimed at building a competitive and inclusive democratic society with strong institutions. The reform agenda embraces every area of public life and puts a strong emphasis on human rights, the rule of law, combating corruption, independent judiciary and improved public administration. We pursue large-scale economic and social development and rely on technological, environmental and educational high standards. This week our Government launched the Armenia Transformation Strategy 2050 with 16 mega goals, based on a bold vision for modernity and progress.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nOn the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations, we are compelled to recognize the many existing challenges to human dignity and human rights. As a member of the Human Rights Council, Armenia will continue to strongly contribute to international cooperation for the protection and promotion of all human rights.\nBoth in its domestic policies and the foreign policy agenda, Armenia underlines the important priority of promoting equal rights and active participation of women and youth in political and public life.\nThe protection of women\u2019s rights in conflict zones and their participation in all stages of conflict resolution are critical. Practical implementation of the provisions of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000) is amongst the important priorities of our Government.\nPrevention of genocides has been an unwavering priority of Armenia. As a nation to have endured its horrors, we have a moral responsibility before humanity to preserve the memory of the victims of genocides and to contribute to the efforts of the international community to prevent the recurrence of horrendous crimes.\nWe appreciate the strong international support expressed also in the Human Rights Council to Armenia\u2019s efforts to advance an effective international prevention agenda.\nArmenia promotes platforms for inclusive dialogue among governments, parliaments, international organizations, academia and civil society on the genocide prevention agenda. The \u201cGlobal Forum against the Crime of Genocide\u201d held in Armenia, has become one such regular platform for dialogue.\nExcellencies,\nThe 75th anniversary of the United Nations is a fitting occasion to reaffirm the strength of its three interconnected pillars of peace, development and human rights. The ongoing conflicts, persistence of radicalism and intolerance, transnational and global challenges continuously reveal our collective vulnerabilities and interdependence. As ever, we need effective multilateralism and therefore a strong and reformed United Nations for a better future, peace and security for generations to come.\nThank you!"

        "file_text": "Mr President, Secretary General, a year ago, we were all looking forward to what, we were sure, would be the grand celebrations at this year\u2019s General Assembly to mark the 75th anniversary of the United Nations. Instead of the anticipated major gathering for the celebrations, we have been forced to stay at home, and employ technology to make our addresses to the Assembly.\nIt is not only these celebrations that have had to be adapted to changed circumstances; our world has been turned upside down, and we have all been forced to learn new ways of doing things.\nIt would have been implausible to suggest, but we have learnt not to shake hands or hug our loved ones. For many people, the most difficult thing to deal with in these uncertain and unsettling times has been the silence forced on churches, mosques, temples and other places of worship. Singing in groups has become a dangerous activity, and a major item which is preoccupying the attention of world leaders is how to send and keep our children in school safely. All the sacred economic rules by which we have been urged to conduct our affairs in the past century have been thrown out, at least for the moment. Indeed, all our best laid plans have turned out to be of no use, when faced with the ravages of an unknown virus. We, in Ghana, have, however, chalked modest successes in trying to defeat the virus through resolute actions by my Government, the cooperation of the Ghanaian people, and the grace of the Almighty.\nMr President, the lessons are clear: we all fell together and looked into the abyss together. Even as we closed our borders and shut airports, the reality dawned on all of us that we had to rely on each other to be able to get out of the trouble we were in. We have all gone down together, we should all rise together.\nIf the answer to this pandemic lies in finding a vaccine, that vaccine should be made available to the whole world, rich and poor alike, developed and developing, all races and all beliefs. The virus has taught us that we are all at risk, and there is no special protection for the rich or a particular class. For as long as the virus exists, whatever medical solutions that might be found should be made available for all in aid of our common humanity.\nWe are told by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that COVID-19 has brought in its wake \u201ca significant reduction in the financing available to developing economies\u201d, again, with the Organisation estimating that \u201cexternal private finance inflows to developing economies could drop by $700 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 levels, exceeding the immediate impact of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis by 60 per cent\u201d. The restructuring of the global financing architecture, to enable access to fresh capital by developing nations, now more than ever, is of immediate necessity, if the gains chalked in transforming their economies are not to be eroded, and the standards of living of their peoples are not to be dangerously lowered.\nNow is the time for this much discussed and much analysed institution of ours, the United Nations, to rise to the occasion.\nOne of its agencies, the WHO, has been in the eye of the storm during this crisis, and all of us have to learn the lessons that have emerged. Yes, we should have arguments about the UN and its agencies and their roles, but, after 75 years, the arguments should be like the ones we have in our families, and not about their very existence.\nWe should correct the longstanding injustice that the current structure and composition of the UN, particularly the Security Council, represents for the nations of Africa. Established in those far-off days of 1945, membership of the Council does not presently reflect the realities of the 21st century. The time has come for the adoption and endorsement of Africa\u2019s Common Position on UN Reform, as set out in the Ezulwini Consensus, so we can create a modern United Nations fit for purpose in our time.\nWe should also focus our attention on the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goals, especially as we mark the beginning of the Decade of Action to deliver the goals and targets of Agenda 2030. Mr President, as co-chair of the SDG Group of Eminent Advocates, Ghana believes that the effective implementation of the 17 SDGs remains critical to making the multilateral system relevant in addressing the global challenges we face.\nIndeed, one such is the threat to the consolidation of democratic governance, especially in Africa, in the face of turbulent conditions prevailing in several parts of Africa. As the newly-elected Chairperson of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), I say that one immediate test confronting the Community is the political situation in Mali, following the coup d\u2019etat that ousted President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, which has been compounded further by the activities of terrorists and violent extremists, who are in control of large swathes of that country and some parts of the Sahel Region. We have learnt, most often through bitter experience, that terrorism and violent extremism are not restricted to particular geographic locations or jurisdictions, as the impact of a single terrorist incident in one part of the world resonates throughout the world. It is incumbent on the UN and, indeed, all Member States to lend their support to the efforts being made by ECOWAS to restore normalcy to Mali, and help us defeat the scourge of terrorism.\nMr. President, the importance of technology has been reinforced in the time of the pandemic. Virtual meetings are now part of our normal lives, young people have graduated in virtual ceremonies, and we might never go back to some of the many conferences that we used to attend, and it is obvious that technology is the future.\nGhana, therefore, welcomes and endorses the Secretary-General\u2019s recommendation, as contained in the Roadmap on Digital Cooperation, to ensure that no one is left behind. How else would we all have maintained a semblance of keeping in touch in the past six months, but for technology?\nThe political season is at its height here in Ghana, as we prepare for presidential and parliamentary elections in December. Like everything else in our world today, even the politicking has been affected by the pandemic, and we cannot campaign for votes in the style to which we are accustomed. We are having to rely on technology to find ways of popularising our messages in the time of COVID-19.\nIt is a matter of great pride to me that, in spite of the difficulties in conducting an election during a pandemic, I am able to state that all Ghanaians are agreed that we have to work together to ensure that the elections will be transparent, free, fair, safe and credible. This will be the eighth election since we embarked on constitutional rule in our Fourth Republic in 1992. Each of the elections has seen an improvement on the previous one, and we are looking forward to this year\u2019s passing off peacefully, with characteristic Ghanaian dignity. We are keenly aware of the reputation that Ghana has built as a tolerant and working democracy, and we have every intention to nurture and improve upon it.\nParamount in everyone\u2019s consideration is the Ghana Project, which aims to modernise all aspects of our lives, and bring prosperity to our land. I have no doubts whatsoever that, at the end of the elections, we shall be proud of ourselves, Africa will have good cause to be proud of us, and the rest of the world will find lessons to learn from us.\nLast year, 2019, was an extraordinarily exciting year for us in Ghana. It marked the 400th anniversary of the start of the barbaric Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, and the arrival in America of the first captured slaves from West Africa.\nTo mark this tragic anniversary, we declared 2019 the \u2018Year of Return\u2019, and extended a welcome back to the African continent of the descendants of the slaves who constitute the bulk of the black population in the Americas and the Caribbean. The invitation was enthusiastically taken up, and a great time was had by all.\nWe have every intention to keep a welcome mat laid out in Ghana for members of the African Diaspora. We, in Ghana, live with the grim reality that the majority of the abducted slaves from the continent were transported to the Americas and Caribbean through the forts dotted along our coastline. We owe it to their descendants to find a safe haven in Ghana, if they should need it.\nThis responsibility means we have to make Ghana secure and desirable both for her present-day citizens and for those in the Diaspora that might want to come back either for a visit or stay.\nI extend the best of luck to you all from Ghana, and look forward to a healthy and happy world.\nI thank you for your attention."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nDistinguished delegates,\nLadies and Gentlemen.\nOur General Assembly session this year is historically unique. We are commemorating the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations, and our General Assembly is meeting virtually for the first time ever. But unprecedented times call for innovative solutions so that as Leaders we remain connected and united in our fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and our desire for a secure and peaceful world.\nMr. President,\nCelebrating this UN milestone allows Samoa to reflect on its journey with the United Nations. The United Nations almost 60 years ago, ably facilitated our peoples\u2019 aspirations to be a sovereign state founded on democratic principles, Christian beliefs and our cultural values. Upon attaining independence in January 1962, we joined the UN almost 15 years later when we felt confident and prepared to assume our role as a global citizen and a dependable member of the United Nations.\nOur membership was firmly rooted in our belief in the sovereign equality of all member states, and grounded in the promise of hope and justice the United Nations offers, irrespective of economic, political or military strength.\nWe are committed to multilateralism with the United Nations representing the last bastion against the challenges and uncertainties that beset our world: from pandemics to economic crises, climate change to systemic discrimination, endemic poverty to dangerous threats to peace and security. We need a balance of power among UN members as well as responsibilities and representation for all people. This would set the scene for partnerships bearing promise for the future.\nThe theme for this year\u2019s general debate is apt and timely. We need to reaffirm our commitment to multilateralism as we face challenges such as the COVID 19 pandemic, so we can shape \u201cthe future we want, the United Nations we need\u201d.\nAs a Pacific SIDS, Samoa has continued to participate and contribute actively to the global effort to address challenges affecting the development, security and human rights pillars of the United Nations.\nMr. President,\nWe are living in trying unparalleled times. Never before as Leaders were we required to make hard decisions to close our borders and to provide near absolute guarantee to our people against the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic or to limit community transmission of the virus. The uncertainties we are facing have tested the mettle of our nations and governments like never before. Samoa extends its sincere condolences to our UN family for the lives lost due to the pandemic and pays tribute to the selfless service of all the frontline workers risking their lives to bring COVID-19 under control.\nWhile Samoa remain COVID-free, we have not been spared the serious and life changing impacts on our nation, and people, who are still recovering from the devastation of the December 2019 measles outbreak that claimed more than 80 young lives. While the experience tested our resolve as a nation, it also strengthened our unity and resilience. Importantly, it reaffirmed our trust in investing in genuine partnerships.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is a timely reminder yet again of our interconnectedness. When our world is teetering over the brink of uncertainties, we need to be \u2018Nations United as One\u2019. Global solidarity and a unified response is our best armour against the pandemic and the socio-economic impacts our people are facing. We acknowledge the ongoing support of the UN and all our development partners who continue to assist our efforts to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic. We are hopeful for the successful development of a vaccine and its equal and even distribution. Let us all spread kindness faster than the virus, and not hate, fear and misinformation.\nMr. President,\nWhat is a future we want, and the UN we need?\nAs Pacific SIDS, our future is already uncertain and compromised if the world continues with the current trajectory of emissions causing more than 3 degrees of global warming. This would pose an existential threat for most of our islands. While the pandemic introduced temporary lockdowns; severe cyclones continue to rampage, coastlines whittle away, sea level rises higher, and our oceans yield to the gnawing acidification. While border closures were observed, climate change knows no restrictions and respects no boundaries.\nTsunamis, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, flooding, deadly bush fires, heat waves and droughts continue to take and devastate countless lives. The heightened occurrence of catastrophic climatic-related disasters all over the world attest to why we must act with absolute urgency even in the wake of the pandemic. Climate procrastination must end now before the window closes on any chance for us to stabilise the Earth\u2019s climate.\nCritical meetings such as UNFCCC COP26, CBD COP15 and the 2020 UN Ocean Conference have been postponed. This however should not equate to a deferment of ambitious actions. We need to uphold the Paris Agreement commitments and maintain the needed momentum on ambitious climate action.\nThe United Nations remains the best hope to provide the political will and the necessary commitment to avoid what is an existential threat for many small states of this UN family.\nWe must mobilise all leaders from governments, NGOs, private sector and empower our youth and rural communities to fight the ongoing threat of climate change and unite against environmental degradation. The 75th Anniversary of the UN should be a point of hope for generations to come rather than an end due to a legacy of selfishness, denial and ignorance. While it is small island states like Samoa that are facing the brunt of the impacts of climate change, no country is immune to the reaches of climate change.\nMr. President,\nWe want a future with peaceful societies, free from conflict and nuclear weapons.\nThe UN has made notable achievements in its peace and security agenda, but much work still needs to be done. COVID-19 is contributing to increased volatility and instability in some situations. Growing inequality, poverty, armed conflicts, terrorism and insecurity still exist. People fleeing their homes in search of refuge and safety are becoming the new normal. And the threat of use of nuclear weapons is still present.\nWe condemn international terrorism unreservedly. Through our membership to disarmament and non-proliferation conventions, we continue to urge for a world without weapons of mass destruction, including the total elimination of nuclear weapons. Our contribution to peaceful societies worldwide is through our police officers serving in UN Peacekeeping missions in countries that require such assistance.\nWe welcome the recent UAE- Israeli \u2018Abraham Accord\u2019 and new developments to secure a peaceful settlement in the Middle East that is durable and fair. We also commend the \u201cSecretary-General\u2019s Appeal for Global Ceasefire\u201d during the pandemic to end the plague of wars and instead fight the disease that is ravaging our world.\nMr President\nSamoa presented its Second Voluntary National review on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals to the High-Level Political Forum this year. I also represented Samoa at the SDG Moment Event last week. We applaud this initiative which takes forward our decisions from the 2019 SDG Summit and puts us World Leaders in the driver\u2019s seat as we begin the Decade of Action, to deliver the SDGs by 2030.\nSamoa\u2019s long-term vision for an improved quality of life for all mirrors that of the UN 2030 Agenda, which is a critical roadmap to uphold the three pillars of the UN. Achieving the SDGs will take us closer to the world envisaged by the founders of this organisation 75 years ago, and the future we wanted when we joined.\nMr. President,\nThe socio-economic wellbeing of our people remains at the core of Samoa\u2019s development initiatives. The promotion, respect of, protection and fulfilment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, is indispensable to ensuring that no one is left behind. We commit to a human rights approach to sustainable development. We continue to invest in robust systems and processes that will improve the effective and inclusive implementation of our human rights obligations. This ensures linkages to our core sustainable development and national security priorities.\nThis year, Samoa hosted the 84th Session of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, a historic first. This milestone event is consistent with Samoa\u2019s ongoing efforts to improve and strengthen the engagement between treaty parties and the treaty bodies. It also ensured the effective and active participation and engagement of the Pacific people, especially the children, on the Convention and the work of the Committee. Samoa encourages other treaty bodies to imitate CRC\u2019s example. We also follow closely the work to reform the UN Human Rights Treaty body system.\nThe rule of law and the vital protection it offers to all states, especially to the weak and small, needs to be respected and we commit to always upholding it. We are also committed to advancing gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, as stipulated in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. Samoa will continue to look at initiatives such as the partnership with the EU and UN on the \u201cSpotlight initiative\u201d to support efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls.\nMr President,\nLet me conclude with a reflection on the UN we need.\nWe have witnessed some positive outcomes in the reforms undertaken so far, reassuring us that the UN can respond effectively to the needs of its diverse membership. We look forward to the positive impact of the UN Development System reform that promises improved UN presence in the Pacific region with the establishment of a Multi-country Office for the Northern Pacific states. We hope for an enhanced and effective UN engagement through the reinvigorated Resident Coordinator system; and expect a more integrated and focused delivery on the ground, informed by the priority needs of the member states. Samoa acknowledges the valuable contribution of the UN Multi-country office in Samoa and its dedicated staff who continue to collaborate with us and the Pacific, to better the lives and improve livelihoods options of our people and nations.\nWe are concerned however with the lack of progress in the reform of the Security Council. Samoa remains convinced that an expanded Security Council that mirrors present day realities is essential for multilateralism and for the Council\u2019s integrity and credibility. Increases in both the permanent and non-permanent categories should be part and parcel of the reform package, and it is time to move to text based negotiations.\nAs a large ocean state and a SIDS, Samoa needs a United Nations that will produce a legally binding Instrument on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ). A UN that will continue to recognise the unique vulnerabilities of SIDS to the impacts of climate change by ensuring the effective implementation of the SAMOA Pathway.\nMr President\nWhile we commit to advance unity for the common good and common prosperity, our ability to do so lies in our uniqueness. The United Nations has become the foremost forum to address issues that transcend national boundaries. The United Nations is placed to understand our unique cultures, respect our different beliefs and embrace our differences as we unite to build the future we want in genuine and durable partnership. God Bless our UN family. Soifua"

        "file_text": "\u2022\tExcellency, Volkan Bozkir, President of the General Assembly\n\u2022\tExcellency, Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations\n\u2022\tExcellencies, Heads of State and Government\n\u2022\tDistinguished Delegates\nThe 75th anniversary of the United Nations falls at a moment of uncommon peril for our people and our planet. The Covid pandemic has claimed nearly one million lives and pushed hundreds of millions into unexpected hardship. It is not a time for doubt or hesitation. We have the tools to meet this test and prevail. We mark other important anniversaries this year.\nTwenty-five years ago, the World Conference on Women in Beijing charted a transformative agenda on gender equality, which continues to guide us. The empowerment of women has made all of us safer and wealthier. But true gender equality has still not been attained in any country.\nFive years ago, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change was signed. Implementing this framework will slow the pace of global warming and give our economies time to adapt to new technologies.\nThe Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, adopted four years ago, will play a major role by reducing the consumption of hydrofluorocarbons. Just over half of Member States have ratified the Kigali Amendment, which is now in force, and I call upon the remainder to ratify as soon as possible.\nFive years ago, the Sustainable Development Goals were adopted, to define our ambitions for integrated global development. Ten years remain before 2030, but let\u2019s not deceive ourselves about how difficult it will be to meet the targets on time. Most countries, especially in Africa, were already off-track before 2020. The pandemic has disrupted growth and revenue collection around the world, most likely for several years to come.\nThese milestones on gender, climate, and development demonstrate the achievements of multilateral action, while also reminding us how much remains to be done.\nI commend the exceptional work being done by the World Health Organization, led by Dr Tedros Adhanom. We will continue to work to reinforce the W.H.O. and make it more effective.\nThe creation of the Access to Covid Tools Accelerator, including the COVAX Global Vaccines Facility, is of critical importance for Africa. Ensuring equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics will speed up the end of the pandemic for everyone.\nThe pandemic has highlighted the importance of resilient national health systems and strong domestic health financing. The African Union is championing this agenda among its Member States, with emphasis on not just spending more, but spending better. The goal is for Africa to leverage its own resources to reinforce the impact of global health partnerships, such as the Global Fund and Gavi.\nIn the coming decades, prosperity will be closely linked to digital literacy and access to high-speed connectivity. The Secretary-General\u2019s roadmap for digital cooperation is compelling and farsighted, building on the work of the Broadband Commission and other initiatives.\nThe global movement for racial justice and equality is not a passing phenomenon. What is required is action that builds public trust in the equal dignity of all citizens, as demonstrated in the treatment of those who have historically been most marginalised, and who continue to suffer mistreatment disproportionately.\nSuccess depends on strengthening institutions, both national and international, including the work of scientists, innovators, and creators. That is not just a question of funding. It is about the positive human values that citizens and governments invest in those institutions, and for which they must be accountable.\nOur descendants will look back and judge how this generation responded to these challenges, especially the leaders.\nDid the collective accomplishment of three generations over 75 years in building a stronger international order disintegrate into recrimination and resentment? Or did we come together to once again secure global progress on a foundation of cooperation and mutual respect?\nThe choice is ours. I thank you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, Excellencies,\nIt is an honor for me to deliver my first statement after assuming office on 16 September as Prime Minister of Japan, at the United Nations which is celebrating its 75th anniversary.\nThe novel coronavirus disease has pulled us into an unprecedented crisis, which in turn has brought the international community back to cooperation from its tendencies towards division and isolation. For the last 75 years, multilateralism has become stronger and made progress in the face of multiple challenges. I call on all of you to unite in solidarity so we can turn the current crisis into an opportunity to reinforce our cooperation.\nMr. President,\nIn our fight against the virus, Japan has been doing its utmost for the health and safety of the people of Japan and around the world, harnessing the wisdom of public and private sectors alike. Now we are at the stage of revitalizing socio-economic activities while maintaining measures for preventing the spread of infections. Let me share my thoughts with you based on Japan\u2019s experiences.\nThe spread of the coronavirus is a human security crisis, posing a threat to the lives, livelihoods and dignity of people across the globe. The guiding principle for us to overcome this crisis must be \u201cleave no one behind.\u201d The concept of human security, which focuses on individuals, has been debated for many years at this very forum of the United Nations General Assembly.\nMr. President,\nAs we face the current crisis, and guided by the principle of human security, I think it is essential to set the goal of \u201cleaving no one\u2019s health behind\u201d as we work towards achieving universal health coverage. I expect this to be our shared goal. On that basis, Japan will proactively lead international efforts with a focus on the following three perspectives in collaboration with other countries.\nFirst, we need to safeguard lives from the novel coronavirus diseases. Japan fully supports the development of therapeutics, vaccines and diagnostics, and works towards ensuring fair and equitable access for all, including those in developing countries. Japan also works with international organizations so that relevant international frameworks will be able to deliver results. We are also proposing a framework of \u201cpatent pooling\u201d. Public-private partnership is essential particularly in the health sector, and Japan is going to promote it steadfastly.\nSecond, we must prepare ourselves for future health crises. Japan is committed to expanding its efforts in developing countries to build hospitals as well as to assist strengthening health and medical systems through providing equipment and supporting human resource development. Working with the ASEAN, Japan is supporting the establishment of an ASEAN Centre for public health emergencies and emerging diseases. Japan has also been supporting the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. As a matter of fact, in Africa, we are witnessing the concrete result of our longstanding cooperation through the TICAD process for human resource development as well as for provision and maintenance of facilities in the health sector. Japan has provided support for the establishment of the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research in Ghana and assisted in the training of its medical laboratory technologists. The Institute serves as the hub of the country\u2019s response to the coronavirus and processes up to about 80% of PCR tests carried out in the country.\nThird, we will take measures to ensure health security in an even broader context. We will continue to work with other countries to improve the conditions of water, sanitation and hygiene, nutrition and other environmental factors. In response to the current crisis, Japan has provided foreign aid of over 170 billion Japanese Yen or $1.54 billion to medical and health sectors.\nAlong with these initiatives, it is critically important to take steps towards revitalizing the economies hit hard by the crisis. To bolster economic activities in developing countries, Japan is implementing the COVID-19 Crisis Response Emergency Support Loan of up to 500 billion Japanese Yen or $4.5 billion over the course of two years. Reviving the economy rests on the safe movement of people. We will make our utmost efforts to ensure universal distribution of vaccines and therapeutics. Free trade should not stop even with the restrictions caused by the crisis. We continue to promote WTO reform and economic partnership agreements with other countries. Times of difficulty are in fact times of innovation. Japan, for its part, will work on digitalization as a matter of urgency.\nNow we must look to the human security concept of the new era in responding to various challenges, accelerating efforts to achieve SDGs and to tackle global issues. To this end, I propose that we tap into the wisdom from around the world to deepen our discussions.\nMr. President,\nLooking forward, we need to \u201cbuild back better\u201d from the COVID-19 pandemic and create a flexible yet resilient society where the SDGs have been achieved and a virtuous cycle of environment and growth is generated. The ongoing crisis is heavily impacting the education of children and the youth who shape the future. It is also affecting women among others. In order to create a better and more inclusive society, there are three points that I consider to be of paramount importance.\nThe first is the significance of the United Nations and multilateralism. The UN should be a forum where all stakeholders engage constructively to respond to crises and work together with transparency. While I greatly respect the activities and efforts of the UN thus far, I would also like to emphasize that the Organization is in need of neutral and fair governance more than ever. The WHO is key in our collective response to infectious diseases. Through its review and reform, I believe the WHO will be able to make even better use of necessary expertise at the right time, in the right manner. With this conviction, Japan stands ready to cooperate in the review and reform process. Likewise, UN reform, including the reform of the Security Council to reflect the realities of the 21st century, is an urgent task as the UN marks its 75th anniversary.\nSecond, I am convinced that the current crisis must not jeopardize international peace and security. UN engagement in peacekeeping operations and peacebuilding remains vital. Based on the policy of \u201cProactive Contribution to Peace\u201d, Japan will continue to contribute to sustaining peace, drawing on its experiences, including through our role in the Peacebuilding Commission, and engaging in strengthening institutions and building capacities. We also remain committed to the capacity building of peacekeeping personnel in collaboration with African and Asian countries.\nThird, we must not allow challenges against the rule of law in times of increasing uncertainties. The rule of law as we ourselves set forth in the SDGs is the foundation of order, both domestic and international, and the very spirit which the UN is built on. In March next year, using virtual platforms, we will host the 14th United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice in Kyoto with the aim of advancing the rule of law. Japan continues to promote a Free and Open Indo-Pacific, the foundation of regional peace and prosperity rooted in the global rule of law.\nMr. President,\nThe issue of abductions by North Korea is a matter of serious concern for the international community. I myself have worked on this issue for many years. This year, two parents of the victims passed away. It is heartbreaking to imagine the pain of the family members who passed, after working so hard to rescue their dearest children and yet not achieving a reunion in the end. As the families of the victims continue to age, there is no time to lose before we resolve the abductions issue. Japan\u2019s position remains unchanged. Japan seeks to normalize its relationship with North Korea, in accordance with the Japan-DPRK Pyongyang Declaration, through comprehensively resolving the outstanding issues of concern such as the abductions, nuclear and missile issues, as well as settlement of the unfortunate past. As the new Prime Minister of Japan, I am ready to meet with Chairman Kim Jong-un without any conditions. Establishing a constructive relationship between Japan and North Korea will not only serve the interests of both sides but will also greatly contribute to regional peace and stability. I will miss no opportunity to take actions with all my dedication.\nThis year marks the 75th anniversary since the first use of nuclear weapons. Hiroshima and Nagasaki must never be repeated. With this resolve, Japan will spare no effort in realizing a world free of nuclear weapons while firmly upholding the Three Non-Nuclear Principles. This year also marks the 50th anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which serves as the cornerstone of the international regime for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. I wish to emphasize once again the importance of maintaining and strengthening the Treaty. We, as the international community, need to stand united to work on arms control and disarmament of conventional weapons, or \u201cDisarmament that Saves Lives.\u201d\nMr. President,\nIn the summer of next year, Japan is determined to host the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games as proof that humanity has defeated the pandemic. I will continue to spare no effort in order to welcome you to Games that are safe and secure.\nI thank you for your attention."

I wish you a successful tenure as you guide the work of the Assembly over the next year. I assure you of the support of Guyana as you contribute to fashioning the United Nations that we need in order to realize the future we want.\nI join in thanking His Excellency Tijjani Muhammad-Bande of Nigeria for his sterling leadership of the 74th Session, especially through the unprecedented circumstances occasioned by the COVID-19 crisis.\nIt would be remiss of me if I did not commend Secretary-General Guterres and his team for their resolve and ingenuity in organising this Assembly in a virtual format for the first time. It is a reminder that every tool at our disposal must be employed to serve the best interests of humanity.\nMr. President,\nMy government assumed office on the 2 August this year. I take this opportunity to commend the international community, including the United Nations for defending the democratic rights of our citizens.\nMy government is committed to greater political inclusion and to enacting institutional reforms to ensure that democracy, the rule of law and constitutional rights are respected. My Government recognizes the dignity and worth of the human person and is determined to secure for the country\u2019s citizens a higher standard of living.\nI join in congratulating the United Nations on its 75th anniversary. I hope that we can soon meet in more normal circumstances to formally celebrate this momentous milestone.\nThe United Nations was birthed 75 years ago amidst the scars of war and the promise of reconstruction. The international community conceived the United Nations and entrusted its hope in this body to usher in an era of peace and prosperity.\nThe Charter of the United Nations commits to ending the scourge of war, fostering respect for human rights, promoting the dignity of the human person, securing equality for men women and nations, defending the principles of international law and advancing human freedoms and social progress.\nEvery nation, no matter how large or small, has but a single vote within this Assembly. The General Assembly remains an invaluable fora where small states can make their voices heard and unite for their mutual benefit.\nDeveloping states in particular owe a great debt to this Organization. Its agencies and affiliated networks \u2014 including the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) \u2014 have been instrumental in alleviating poverty, hunger and famine; saving and caring for lives; ensuring respect for human rights; promoting greater equality for women; safeguarding children; promoting the environment and providing technical assistance to developing states.\nMr. President,\nI ask you all to cast your minds back to 2015, and the three pivotal UN conferences that took place during that year. In June, the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, held in Addis Ababa, addressed the main challenge facing developing nations \u2014 accessing development financing. In September, the Assembly hosted the Sustainable Development Summit and adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals which UN members agreed to realize by the year 2030. Most importantly, the Climate Change Summit in Paris culminated in the historic Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement on climate change represents the single greatest commitment made by countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These three events exemplified the true character of this organization \u2014 the nations of the world uniting to boldly tackle these threat and to promote sustainable development.\nThe United Nations, armed with the lofty but ambitious vision of global security and prosperity, remains as relevant and necessary today as it was in 1945. The world has changed remarkably in ensuing 75 years but the United Nations has also adapted to and been an agent of change.\nAmong the changes which the United Nations has witnessed was the proliferation of newly-independent states, following the end of the Second World War. Many of these newly-independent states are developing countries which account for more than half of the world\u2019s states and population.\nThe United Nations make-up, inclusive of the Security Council, must reflect this reality. The Security Council, in particular, should be reformed to increase the number of developing countries that are permanent members.\nMr. President,\nDeveloping countries continue to face constraints associated by limited access to development financing. Improved access to such financing is vital for the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals. The United Nations must continue to champion the need for great access to development financing for developing states.\nThe UN has a special duty to ensure that members\u2019 obligations under international agreements are fulfilled and that setbacks in meeting commitments are reversed. Guyana applause the ongoing work on reform of the United Nations development system (UNDS). We believe, however, that there should be greater focus on reforms that are tailored to allow the UN to respond adequately to existing and emerging gaps in development and to find solutions to existing threats.\nMr. President,\nMultilateralism is the key to unlocking solutions to humanity\u2019s problems. The ongoing public health and climate crises have demonstrated that it is in the common interest of humanity that we fully embrace the ideals of multilateralism.\nAs a testimony to Guyana\u2019s commitment to multilateralism, in January of this year we assumed the Chairmanship of the Group of 77 and China. Our statement to the world is that a state\u2019s capacity for leadership is not constrained by its size.\nA product of our multilateral efforts is the United Nations development agenda. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development remains a viable plan of action to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path. In this critical Decade of Action and Delivery for Sustainable Development, we must be fully focused on eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions. No one must be left behind.\nAt this time, an earnest and thorough assessment of the development agenda is warranted, with a view to recommitting ourselves to its aims. It is therefore regrettable that we missed the opportunity to adopt a robust outcome document at the conclusion of the 2020 High-Level segment of the Economic and Social Council and the High-Level Political Forum on sustainable development.\nGlobal partnerships for development had never been more urgent in order to mobilize the means to implement the \u2018Agenda\u2019. My government believes that both the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council should play a more proactive role in catalyzing partnerships and should serve as platforms for ensuring coherence in the joint economic, environmental, and socio-political initiatives being undertaken.\nNow more than ever, we need a resurgence of political will and commitment to protect the multilateral architecture and institutions, including the International Court of Justice. Guyana reposes confidence in this institution. We are committed to the rule of international law, inclusive of the peaceful resolution of disputes.\nIn March 2018, Guyana filed its application in the International Court of Justice seeking an affirmation of the validity of the 1899 Arbitral Award and the international boundary that it established. We are happy to report that on the 30th of June, 2020 the International Court of Justice held its first virtual hearing on the controversy involving Guyana and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Regrettably, Venezuela has refused to participate in the hearing. Guyana now awaits the determination of the International Court of Justice on whether the Court has jurisdiction to proceed to hearing the merits of the case.\nMr. President,\nAs we consider the state of our world today, we must acknowledge the challenges facing us and their implications for the progress and prosperity of our peoples. Foremost on the list is the COVID-19 pandemic and its multidimensional impacts. The pandemic has launched an attack on the health and well-being of our people while the economy has become a causality of this assault. The pandemic is reversing our gains on health, poverty and education.\nMore than ever, the resolve of the United Nations is being tested and it is evident that no single country can overcome the debilitating effects alone. This reality must inform the trajectory of the United Nations so that it can support the efforts of developing countries to rebuild and to become more resilient.\nA strong multilateral system is required for collective action to stem this pandemic. I acknowledge the support of UN agencies in my country\u2019s response to the COVID-19 crisis. We trust and support the efforts of the UN system to ensure fair, transparent and timely global access to preventive tools, equipment and materials for testing. In this regard, we recognize the important role of the World Health Organization in coordinating the response of the UN system and in global public health preparedness and response. We look forward to increased international cooperation to contain, mitigate and defeat the pandemic.\nMr. President,\nCompeting and compounded by the pandemic is climate change. Every year is another record breaking year for extreme weather conditions and climate events. As a low-lying coastal State, Guyana, is acutely aware of the high toll of these extreme weather conditions. But equally costly is climate resilience. Developing countries are thus set between a rock and a hard place. The only way to ease this burden is through concerted and balanced climate action, especially via mitigation, climate financing, technical cooperation and capacity building. We also urge all States to set ambitious targets in their Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement and to work earnestly towards them.\nGuyana\u2019s Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS) reflects our national development agenda. The strategy will ensure that we fulfill our Nationally Determined Contributions and place our country along a path of sustainable and climate-resilient development.\nMr. President,\nProgress on the Sustainable Development Agenda will be impeded by conflicts. We therefore must continue to devote our collective efforts towards the achievement of peace in every region of the globe.\nMr. President,\nThe future we want and the United Nations that we need are in our hands. It is ours to fashion. History must not find us victims of inaction or succumbing to failure.\nMultilateralism is the pathway to achieving our ends. We must collectively work to preserve this instrument and to strengthen the United Nations as we build a better world for our generation and those to follow.\nI thank you.\nAnd God bless all the people of this planet, thank you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, dear delegates,\nThe world is facing many challenges. Seventy-five years after the establishment of the United Nations, we are more dependent on each other than ever.\nWe need more multilateralism and we need more cooperation.\nWe are facing a global pandemic. Threatening the lives of the most vulnerable people in our countries.\nWe are facing climate change that risks getting out of control.\nWe are facing an economic setback that may rob millions of people of a descent future.\nWe are facing terrorism, instability and increasing danger of cyber-attacks, disinformation and nuclear weapons.\nAll of these challenges have one thing in common. They can only be solved if we take action and if we work together.\nAre we doing that today? In some areas we are.\nBut the truth is: we can do it much better.\nDenmark is ready to play its part.\nSo far, we have allocated one billion Danish kroner to assist some of the world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable people in the fight against COVID-19.\nWe are committed to a reformed World Health Organization to ensure a stronger and a more resilient global health systems and plan to double our core support to the World Health Organization.\nWe insist on using the pandemic as a wake-up call. To build a better, greener and more fair future. To deliver on the Paris Agreement and on the Sustainable Development Goals.\nMr. President,\nWe are ready to take the lead on fulfilling SDG 7 as well.\nBecause energy transition must be at the heart of our efforts.\nGreen investments not only help the climate. They also create millions of jobs, providing better lives, and stronger societies and a future that we can believe in.\nPolitical leadership and high ambitions in the run up to COP26 is urgently needed to achieve neutrality by 2050.\nIn the years to come, Denmark plans on reducing emissions by 70 percent.\nMr. President,\nWe must solve the global inequality that the virus has so brutally exposed.\nThe inequality of today \u2014 leads to the conflicts of tomorrow.\nWe need to invest more in conflict prevention.\nAnd we, therefore, strongly support the Secretary-General\u2019s call for a global ceasefire in the face of the COVID-19 crisis to redouble our efforts to prevent and resolve armed conflicts and to build more peaceful societies.\nAnd we need to bridge our humanitarian, development and peace efforts.\nDenmark continues to work within the framework of international law and conventions regarding migration and refugees. But the asylum system of the past, does not fit the challenges of the future. We need an asylum system that is more fair and actually also more humane.\nWe must reduce incentives to embark on dangerous journeys \u2014 and put an end to the cynical business of human smugglers.\nCountries along the routes of migration need more assistance to manage irregular migration and countries of origin need more help to create real alternatives.\nMr. President,\nThe UN was built on the ideals of human rights. But the current pandemic jeopardizes the progress we have made already on gender equality.\nEvery woman and every girl have the right to decide over their life, their body and future.\nAnd Denmark stands with the Secretary-General and the vision behind his Call to Action on Human Rights. Rights and dignity must be at the core of all UN efforts.\nMr. President,\nThe world of today faces more global challenges than ever. I am hopeful that together we can deliver on the promises made 75 years ago. \u201cWe the peoples\u201d we must act together.\nCurrent and future generations expect nothing less.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "Colleague Heads of State and Government;\nUN Secretary-General, His Excellency Antonio Guterres;\nPresident of the General Assembly, His Excellency Volkan Bazkir;\nExcellencies:\nGood Afternoon.\nMr. President:\nPermit me at the outset to congratulate you on your election as President of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, and to assure you of the unwavering support of the Government of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas during your tenure.\nI also wish to thank your predecessor, His Excellency Tiijani Muhammad-Bande, for his stellar efforts in guiding the work of the 74th Session of the General Assembly.\nMr. President:\nI address this Assembly at a time when the world is still reeling from the seismic level shocks that the COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed on the global community.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an unprecedented crisis that has halted global economic activity and threatened global public health and social well-being.\nThe more than twenty-seven million confirmed COVID-19 cases across the globe continue to increase as we speak.\nOn behalf of the Government and people of The Bahamas, I express solidarity with Member States who are fighting COVID-19 and extend our sincere condolences for the loss of life.\nMr. President:\nWhen I addressed the Assembly last year, in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian, I implored world leaders to treat the global climate emergency as the greatest challenge facing humanity.\nLittle did we know that just a few months later, an even greater challenge would emerge, forcing the world to come to a grinding halt, at a proportion not witnessed since the Second World War.\nHence, the theme for the 75th Session, The future we want, the United Nations we need reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism \u2014 confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action, is relevant and applicable to our current reality.\nMr. President:\nTourism serves as the main economic earner for The Bahamas.\nLike other countries, we had to temporarily close our borders and regulate the movement of people to limit the spread of COVID-19. Our priority was, and will always be, to protect lives and ensure the safety of those within our borders. The temporary closure of our borders caused one of the largest declines in visitor numbers since the advent of modern tourism in The Bahamas.\nThe slowdown in economic activity in some areas of the private sector caused an unprecedented increase in unemployment prompting the activation of an Unemployment Benefits Programme and Self-Employed Assistance Programme, as well as other social safety programmes, including the National Food Distribution Program, the largest feeding program in our nation\u2019s history.\nMr. President:\nSmall island developing countries like The Bahamas always appear to be operating in a vicious recovery mode cycle, having to deal with successive exogenous shocks and climatic events.\nThe Bahamas experienced major hurricanes in 2015, 2016, 2017, and in September 2018, Hurricane Dorian, the largest Atlantic storm in recorded history.\nUN initial assessments valued the loss and damage incurred at $3.4 billion. Infrastructure and housing projects are ongoing, while we grapple the impact of COVID19, we continue to reach out to international partners for the much-needed assistance to restore and rebuild those islands.\nA Donors Conference coordinated by the United Nations Development Programme was held in Nassau on 13 January 2020, for which I wish to express the heartfelt appreciation of my Government for all of the pledges of financial resources and assistance made at this conference. My government looks forward to the full realization the pledges made as they are essential to our ongoing recovery efforts.\u201d\nMr. President:\nThe economies of small island developing states, including those of the Caribbean Community, are under constant assault from various external shocks beyond their control.\nThis group of countries is among the most disaster- prone areas in the world. Pandemics, hurricanes, or climatic events, do not discriminate between low-income countries, middle-income countries, and developed economies.\nHence the compelling question remains, as to why middle-income countries are still being assessed by international financial institutions using outdated methodologies that give no consideration to a country\u2019s level of exposure, vulnerability and ability to recover from exogenous shocks.\nIt is to be noted that ECLAC\u2019s review of the COVID-19 impact estimates that developmental achievements in the Caribbean and Latin America have been reversed by at least a decade.\nWorld Bank projections point to at least 100 million people falling into extreme poverty.\nI therefore reiterate the call for the institutionalization of a vulnerability index in the decision-making processes of the international financial institutions and international donor community.\nI also echo the call of the Region for the capitalization of a Caribbean Resilience Fund.\nThe decision of the G20 group to suspend debt service payments for the least developed countries is commendable, and I offer that this concession should be extended to other economic groupings as well.\nMr. President:\nGiven the immeasurable stress and strain placed on global health care systems and supply chains, I commend the Secretary-General for his continuous efforts to combat the pandemic.\nMr. President:\nWhile we remain cautiously optimistic for a viable COVID-19 vaccine in the not too distant future, we note the collaborative efforts of the COVAX facility to secure arrangements for developing countries.\nDeveloping countries should be able to access vaccines via a transparent procurement process at affordable market rates.\nWe salute the doctors, nurses, other healthcare workers and all on the frontline, who have sacrificed their own health in order to assist tens of millions of people around the world.\nThey are the real heroes, to whom the global community owes immense gratitude.\nMr. President:\nAs we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, we should not allow the pandemic to dampen our spirits and detract from the commemoration of this august institution and its extensive list of achievements and milestones.\nMultilateralism has been, and continues to be, the most effective conduit through which small island states can have their voices heard and their policy requirements advanced.\nMr. President:\nGlobally, we continue to see unprecedented climatic and environmental challenges. Worldwide, there has been a decline of 85 per cent of the area of viable wetlands.\nScientific reviews reveal that sixty per cent of the ocean area is impacted by adverse human activity including overfishing, pollution and acidification from chemicals.\nThe Bahamas continues to play its role in the preservation of a healthy marine and land environment which includes the expansion of marine protected areas and heritage sites.\nWe therefore welcome the scheduling of a Biodiversity Summit on 30 September.\nWe will continue to remain actively engaged in the negotiations towards an international treaty to sustainably use and conserve marine biodiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction.\nIn this context, I am pleased to inform that the Bahamas will seek to renew its membership on the Council of the International Maritime Organization, and we count on the invaluable support of member states for our re-election.\nMr. President:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has spurred the accelerated utilization of and access to information communication technology especially for young people and economically challenged communities.\nThis trend must continue in a post COVID-19 environment, as well as promotion of STEM careers for young people as education has the potential to act as the great equalizer.\nMr. President:\nThe Bahamas is carefully formulating the gradual re-opening of the country to visitors. We hope to welcome some tourists this year.\nHowever, as we adjust to this new normal, we acknowledge that no country can survive this pandemic alone.\nMr. President:\nWe also take this occasion to reiterate our support for an end to the economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba.\nAccordingly, The Bahamas will join the international community by voting in favor of the General Assembly\u2019s annual resolution on this agenda item.\nMr. President:\nPlease be assured of The Bahamas\u2019 unwavering commitment to the United Nations and our pledge to adhere always, to the UN Charter of principles on which the organization was founded.\nI thank you."

I wish a speedy recovery to those affected by this deadly virus.\nMr. President,\nI would like to extend my warm congratulations to you on your brilliant election to the presidency of the 75th regular session of the General Assembly and assure you of my support and the full cooperation of my delegation.\nI would also like to pay a well-deserved tribute to Professor Tijjani Muhammad Bande, the outgoing President who carried out his duties effectively in lockdown, at a time when it was necessary to show imagination in order to experiment with new working methods and respond to the many requests related to the management of important dossiers of the General Assembly.\nIn the same vein, I would especially like to express to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Antonio Guterres, the gratitude of the Republic of Guinea for his pleasing and commendable initiatives in favour of preserving international peace and security and dealing with the international health crisis.\nMr. President,\nIn a world sadly faced with various challenges, the theme of this session: \u201cThe future we want, the UN we need: reaffirming our commitment to multilateralism\u201d, calls on us to act now more than ever. The central role of the UN and its leadership is binding on all member states to promote and strengthen multilateralism.\nIn this increasingly interdependent world, no single State alone can face the numerous and diverse challenges facing humanity.\nThrough its multiple fields of action and its ability to coordinate international intervention, the UN supports member States in achieving their development goals, eradicating poverty and fighting to mitigate the effects of climatic change.\nThe world needs now more than ever a reformed, strong organization that acts based on the values enshrined in the charter and the universal declaration of Human rights, and one that is capable, through its specialized institutions, of confronting the challenges of peace, sustainable development and health.\n75 years after its creation, we can attest that the United Nations has been able to meet the expectations of its founding fathers in their efforts to save future generations from the scourge of a third world war, promote peace and develop friendly and cooperative relations among nations.\nA renewed and strengthened international governance must take greater account of the interests of developing countries, especially in the implementation of the SDGs and the programme of action of the 3rd Addis Ababa conference on financing for development and other previous commitments. It is through this global partnership that our countries will be able to stand up and pursue the sustainable development Agenda.\nGuinea welcomes the launching of the decade of action to deliver the SDGs which demands that we scale up our ambitions and accelerate the implementation of appropriate and lasting solutions to the challenges of poverty, gender inequality, conflicts, climate change and the financial gap in implementing the SDGs.\nIn this context, the Republic of Guinea has integrated all important matters relating to the implementation of the SDGs into its national development plan in order to create growth and prosperity in favour of the Guinean populations and to make Guinea an emerging country through bilateral and multilateral partnership. Our country is focused on the implementation of the sustainable development goals.\nAs part of its National Economic and Social Development Plan (PNDES) 2016- 2020, our country has established effective instruments, such as the National Agency for Financing Local Communities (ANAFIC), the National Agency for Economic and Social Inclusion (ANIES) and the Local Development Fund (FODEL), among others.\nWith regard to managing the current health crisis, the Republic of Guinea, like other countries worldwide severely affected by the coronavirus, has adopted a robust response plan and declared a state of health emergency.\nThe objectives of this national plan are to control and curb the pandemic, mitigate the consequences of the crisis, particularly on households in a precarious situation, and eliminate the effects of the pandemic on small and medium-sized businesses.\nA scientific response board has been created to provide guidance and reinforce measures to fight the pandemic, with a view to eradicating and halting the spread of the coronavirus across the country. The financial cost of the plan is $350 million. The Guinean people have adhered to it and are involved in its implementation, based on our experience of tackling the Ebola virus epidemic.\nI would like to take this opportunity to renew the Republic of Guinea\u2019s gratitude to its technical and financial partners, and to friendly countries for their constant, decisive and complementary support for our national efforts to eradicate this pandemic.\nMy delegation expresses its desire to see the inclusion of the principle of universal access to public health included in the political declaration on global health coverage.\nWe must spare no effort to build a world in peace and security to bequeath to future generations.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,\nThis year, the international community celebrates two, without exaggeration, historic anniversaries: the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War and establishment of the United Nations.\nThe importance of these two forever interlinked events cannot be overemphasized. In 1945, Nazism was defeated, the ideology of aggression and hatred was crushed, and the experience and spirit of alliance, as well as the awareness of the huge price that had been paid for peace and our common Victory, helped construct the post-war world order. It was built on the ultimate foundation of the UN Charter that remains the main source of international law to this day.\nI am convinced that this anniversary makes it incumbent upon all of us to recall the timeless principles of inter-State communication enshrined in the UN Charter and formulated by the founding fathers of our universal Organization in the clearest and most unambiguous terms. These principles include the equality of sovereign States, non-interference with their domestic affairs, the right of peoples to determine their own future, non-use of force or the threat of force, and political settlement of disputes.\nLooking back at the past decades, one can say that despite all difficulties of the Cold War period, major geopolitical shifts and all the intricacies of today\u2019s global politics, the UN has been ably fulfilling its mission of protecting peace, promoting sustainable development of the peoples and continents and providing assistance in mitigating local crises.\nThis enormous potential and expertise of the UN is relevant and serves as a solid basis for moving ahead. After all, just like any other international organization or regional entity, the UN should not grow stiff, but evolve in accordance with the dynamics of the 21st century and consistently adapt to the realia of the modern world that is indeed becoming more complicated, multipolar and multidimensional.\nThe current changes certainly have an effect on the principal UN body, the Security Council, as well as on the debate concerning the approaches to its reform. Our logic is that the Security Council should be more inclusive of the interests of all countries, as well as the diversity of their positions, base its work on the principle of the broadest possible consensus among States and, at the same time, continue to serve as the cornerstone of global governance, which cannot be achieved unless the permanent members of the Security Council retain their veto power.\nSuch a right pertaining to the five nuclear powers, the victors of the Second World War, remains indicative of the actual military and political balance to this day. Most importantly, it is an essential and unique instrument that helps prevent unilateral actions that may result in a direct military confrontation between major States, and provides an opportunity to seek compromise or at least avoid solutions that would be completely unacceptable to others and act within the framework of international law, rather than a vague, gray area of arbitrariness and illegitimacy.\nAs diplomatic practice shows, this instrument actually works, unlike the infamous pre-war League of Nations with its endless discussions, declarations without mechanisms for real action and with States and peoples in need not having the right to assistance and protection.\nForgetting the lessons of history is short-sighted and extremely irresponsible, just like the politicized attempts to arbitrarily interpret the causes, course and outcomes of the Second World War and twist the decisions of the conferences of the Allies and the Nuremberg Tribunal that are based on speculation instead of facts.\nIt is not just vile and offending the memory of the fighters against Nazism. It is a direct and devastating blow to the very foundation of the post-war world order, which is particularly dangerous in view of the global stability facing serious challenges, the arms control system breaking down, regional conflicts continuing unabated, and threats posed by terrorism, organized crime and drug trafficking intensifying.\nWe are also experiencing a whole new challenge of the coronavirus pandemic. This disease has directly affected millions of people and claimed the most important thing: the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. Quarantines, border closures, numerous serious troubles to citizens of almost all States constitute the present-day realia. It has been especially difficult for elderly people who, due to the necessary restrictions, have not been able to hug their loved ones, children and grandchildren for weeks or even months.\nExperts are yet to fully assess the scale of the social and economic shock caused by the pandemic and all its long-term consequences. However, it is already evident that it will take a really, really long time to restore the global economy. Furthermore, even the proven anti-crisis measures will not always work. We will need new innovative solutions.\nThe only way to elaborate such solutions is to work together, which is the most important task for both the UN and G20 States, as well as other leading inter State organizations and integration associations that are also going through tough times due to the pandemic impact and need fundamentally new horizons and scope of development.\nThis very idea of a qualitative integrative growth, the \u201cintegration of integrations\u201d, is the one behind Russia\u2019s initiative to form a Greater Eurasian Partnership involving all Asian and European countries without exception. It is purely pragmatic and increasingly relevant.\nBesides, I would like to draw attention once again to Russia\u2019s proposal to create so-called \u201cgreen corridors\u201d free from trade wars and sanctions, primarily for essential goods, food, medicine and personal protective equipment needed to fight the pandemic.\nIn general, freeing the world trade from barriers, bans, restrictions and illegitimate sanctions would be of great help in revitalizing global growth and reducing unemployment. According to experts, total or partial reduction in global employment in the second quarter of this year equals to the loss of 400 million jobs, and we have to do our utmost to prevent this unemployment from growing long-term and ensure that people return to work and can support their families instead of finding themselves imprisoned by poverty with no prospects in life.\nThis is indeed a most acute global social problem, so the politics has a mission now to pave the way for trade, joint projects and fair competition, rather than tie the hands of business and discourage business initiative.\nThe pandemic has also pinpointed a series of ethical, technological and humanitarian matters. For instance, advanced digital technologies helped quickly reorganize education, trade and services, as well as set up distant learning and online courses for people of different ages. Artificial intelligence has assisted doctors in making more accurate and timely diagnoses and finding the best treatment.\nHowever, just like any other innovation, digital technologies tend to spread uncontrollably and, just like conventional weapons, can fall into the hands of various radicals and extremists not only in the regional conflict zones, but also in quite prosperous countries, thus engendering enormous risks.\nIn this regard, matters related to cybersecurity and the use of advanced digital technology also deserve a most serious deliberation within the UN. It is important to hear and appreciate the concerns of people over the protection of their rights, such as the right to privacy, property and security, in the new era.\nWe must learn to use new technologies for the benefit of humankind, seek for a right balance between encouraging the development of artificial intelligence and justifiable restrictions to limit it, and work together towards a consensus in the field of regulation that would avert potential threats in terms of both military and technological security, as well as traditions, law, and morals of human communication.\nI would like to point out that during the pandemic, doctors, volunteers and citizens of various countries have been showing us examples of mutual assistance and support, and such solidarity defies borders. Many countries have also been helping each other selflessly and open-heartedly. However, there have been cases showing the deficit of humanity and, if you will, kindness in the relations at the official interstate level.\nWe believe that the UN prestige could strengthen and enhance the role of the humanitarian or human component in multilateral and bilateral relations, namely in people-to-people and youth exchanges, cultural ties, social and educational programs, as well as cooperation in sports, science, technology, environment and health protection.\nAs to healthcare, just like in economy, we now need to remove, as many as possible, obstacles to partner relations. Our country has been actively contributing to global and regional counter-COVID-19 efforts, providing assistance to most affected states both bilaterally and within multilateral formats.\nIn doing so, we first of all take into account the central coordinating role of the World Health Organization, which is part of the UN system. We believe it essential to qualitatively strengthen the WHO capability. This work has already begun, and Russia is genuinely motivated to engage in it.\nBuilding on the scientific, industrial and clinical experience of its doctors Russia has promptly developed a range of test systems and medicines to detect and treat the coronavirus, as well as registered the world\u2019s first vaccine, \u201cSputnik-V.\u201d\nI would like to reiterate that we are completely open to partner relations and willing to cooperate. In this context, we are proposing to hold an online high-level conference shortly for countries interested in cooperation in the development of anti- coronavirus vaccines.\nWe are ready to share experience and continue cooperating with all States and international entities, including in supplying the Russian vaccine which has proved reliable, safe, and effective, to other countries. Russia is sure that all capacities of the global pharmaceutical industry need to be employed so as to provide a free access to vaccination for the population of all states in the foreseeable future.\nA dangerous virus can affect anyone. The coronavirus has struck the staff of the United Nations, its headquarters and regional structures just like everyone else. Russia is ready to provide the UN with all the necessary qualified assistance; in particular, we are offering to provide our vaccine, free of charge, for the voluntary vaccination of the staff of the UN and its offices. We have received requests from our UN colleagues in this respect, and we will respond to those.\nThere are other critical items on today\u2019s agenda. The issues of both environmental protection and climate change should remain the focus of joint efforts.\nThe specialized multilateral UN conventions, treaties and protocols have proved fully relevant. We are calling on all states to comply with them in good faith, particularly in working to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement.\nDear colleagues! I would like to underline again, that Russia will make every effort to contribute to peaceful political and diplomatic resolution of regional crises and conflicts, as well as to ensuring strategic stability.\nFor all the disputes and differences, at times misunderstanding and even distrust on the part of some colleagues, we will consistently advance constructive, uniting initiatives, first of all in arms control and strengthening the treaty regimes existing in this area. This includes the prohibition of chemical, biological and toxin weapons.\nThe issue of primary importance that should and must be promptly dealt with is, of course, the extension of the Russia-US Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which will expire shortly, i.e. in February 2021. We are engaged in negotiations with our US partners on the matter.\nWe also expect that mutual restraint would be exercised with regard to deploying new missile systems. I would like to add that as early as last year, Russia declared a moratorium on deploying ground-launched medium and short-range missiles in Europe and other regions as long as the United States of America refrains from such actions. Unfortunately, we have not received any reaction to our proposal from either our US partners or their allies.\nI believe that such reciprocal steps on specific issues would provide a sound basis for launching a serious, profound dialogue on the entire range of factors affecting strategic stability. It would aim at achieving comprehensive arrangements, shaping a solid foundation for the international security architecture that would build on prior experience in this field and in line with both the existing and future politico-military and technological realia.\nIn particular, Russia is putting forward an initiative to sign a binding agreement between all the leading space powers that would provide for the prohibition of the placement of weapons in outer space, threat or use of force against outer space objects.\nWe are well aware of the fact that security issues as well as other problems discussed by this jubilee UN General Assembly call for consolidated efforts on the basis of values that unite us, our shared memory of the lessons of history, and the spirit of alliance which guided the anti-Hitler coalition participants who found it possible to raise above differences and ideological preferences for the sake of Victory and peace for all nations on the Earth.\nIn the current challenging environment, it is important for all countries to show political will, wisdom and foresight. The permanent members of the UN Security Council \u2014 those powers that, for 75 years now, have been bearing particular responsibility for international peace and security, the preservation of the foundations of international law \u2014 should take the lead here.\nFully realizing this responsibility, Russia has suggested convening a G5 summit. It would aim at reaffirming the key principles of behavior in international affairs, elaborating ways to effectively address today\u2019s most burning issues. It is encouraging that our partners have supported the initiative. We expect to hold such summit \u2014 in person \u2014 as soon as epidemiological situation makes it possible.\nI would like to reiterate that in an interrelated, interdependent world, amid the whirlpool of international developments, we need to work together drawing on the principles and norms of international law enshrined in the UN Charter. This is the only way for us to carry out the paramount mission of our Organization and provide a decent life for the present and future generations.\nI wish all the peoples of our planet peace and well-being.\nThank you.\n"

While it does not contain a miracle recipe, the solutions for which he advocates are a sure antidote to pessimism and the temptation of despair.\nIn our analysis of the state of the world last year, we were already expressing our concerns about some of the major trends that were emerging. Those trends included poverty, inequality, climate change, low levels of investment, slow progress in mobilizing the resources needed to effectively implement the Sustainable Development Goals, continuing conflicts and the rise of terrorism.\nWe also stressed the negative impact that ongoing geopolitical upheavals, rising tensions due to the trade war and the projected decline in economic growth could have on the fight against poverty and the promotion of international cooperation.\nBut the year 2020 is nothing like previous years! It will remain forever etched in the annals of history as the year in which the world was shaken by unprecedented violence. The eruption of the COVID-19 pandemic was a major event with a considerable health, political, economic and humanitarian impact.\nThe major upheavals that it has caused have had serious economic consequences and affected all sectors of the economy, particularly tourism and the informal economy sector, which employs a significant proportion of the population in low- income countries. The containment measures that States had to adopt to prevent the spread of the virus led to massive job losses and generated real liquidity problems. According to the World Bank, COVID-19 would plunge Africa into its first recession in more than 25 years.\nProjections of widening public deficits in our countries are worrying, hence the importance of an adequate response from international financial institutions and bilateral partners in favour of developing countries. While those countries are making considerable efforts to cope with the crisis, they will clearly not be able to contain its devastating effects alone.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected women, children, the elderly, migrants and refugees. We must ensure that, in our response, special attention is paid to those groups.\nAllow me to re-emphasize here the critical importance of accelerating our efforts to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 5, which is to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls as a cross-cutting foundation for the achievement of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.\nMr. President,\nIn Djibouti, we very quickly realized the severity of the crisis and put urgent health measures in place to contain the spread of the virus. Thanks to a policy of border controls, containment, mass testing and treatment of infected people, the assessment we are drawing up today is largely satisfactory.\nHere we would like to commend all the health personnel, whose professionalism and dedication have been exemplary. We also owe our success to the cooperation of the people of Djibouti, whose discipline and motivation in the fight against COVID-19 is a source of inspiration for us.\nWe also commend resilience in the face of the proliferation of false information described as an \u201cinfodemic\u201d by the WHO. It is only through the establishment of relationships based on trust and genuine and permanent dialogue with citizens that we can overcome this epidemic.\nDespite the successes achieved, our action is characterized by the rejection of complacency and the exhortation to be vigilant at all times.\nWith regard to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the economy and employment, although it is difficult to measure the medium- and long-term effects, particularly on maritime traffic, Djibouti, like other African countries, has been hit hard by the health crisis. In response, we have undertaken emergency measures to support the economy and employment and created a special fund for social solidarity and the fight against coronavirus. Those measures have contributed to containing the effects of the crisis and we have also been able to rely on the valuable support of international financial institutions such as the World Bank, the IMF and the AfDB, as well as the support of friendly countries.\nIt goes without saying that, due to its vulnerability to external shocks, lasting disruptions in the global supply chain, declining flows of foreign direct investment, the disruptive effects of climate change and the continued flow of refugees fleeing instability and conflict, Djibouti hopes to be able to rely further on the solidarity of its partners and friends.\nMr. President,\nDespite the close link established by scientists between climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic, including the possible explosion of zoonoses, efforts to implement the Paris Agreement have not made the expected progress. Given the severity of the health crisis and the exclusive media attention given to COVID-19, climate change has been relegated to a secondary priority.\nBut make no mistake! We must remain vigilant! Our success in preventing future pandemics will depend on the attention and resources we devote to fighting climate change!\nMr. President,\nThe shockwave caused by the pandemic could also have a detrimental impact on the fight against terrorism and conflict management in many theatres. Some terrorist groups have seen it as an opportunity to reorganize and take advantage of the security vacuum created by the fight against COVID-19. Peacekeeping operations, despite initial difficulties, have fortunately been able to adapt and reorganize themselves in order to pursue the vital mandate with which they were entrusted.\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s call for a global ceasefire has been widely heard and we support his appeals to the international community to \u201credouble its efforts to make it a reality by the end of the year\u201d.\nMr. President,\nWe welcome the economic and political progress made in Somalia despite the triple shock of COVID-19, the locust invasion and devastating floods. The results of the consultations initiated in Dhusamareb, the agreement on an electoral model and the election of a new Prime Minister provide grounds for the belief and hope that Somalia is on a positive and irreversible path towards lasting peace and stability.\nWe strongly support the mission of AMISOM, which is aimed at degrading the threat posed by Al-Shabaab. We call on the international community to continue to provide adequate material, logistical and financial support.\nWe are closely following the implementation of the Revitalized Agreement of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan, which has led to the establishment of a Transitional Government of National Unity. We hope that the armed groups that are not signatories to the Revitalized Agreement will join the peace efforts led by the region and supported by the international community as soon as possible. The people of South Sudan are tired of war! They have made huge sacrifices! They deserve peace!\nDjibouti reiterates its support for efforts to achieve lasting peace in Yemen in accordance with Security Council resolution 2216 (2015), the Gulf Cooperation Council initiative and the decisions made at the National Dialogue Conference. We further call on all stakeholders to work in good faith to implement the provisions of the Riyadh Agreement and reaffirm our commitment to the unity and territorial integrity of Yemen.\nWe remain extremely concerned about the major environmental risk and threat of oil spill posed by the oil tanker FSO SAFER. We urge the Houthis rebels to urgently cooperate with United Nations experts to carry out the appropriate inspections and urgent work necessary to contain the threat.\nMr. President,\nOn 21 September, we celebrated the seventy-fifth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations virtually and took the opportunity to reaffirm the central place that our Organization must occupy in the collective efforts to address the challenges we face.\nThe fight against the COVID-19 pandemic dictates that we have a compelling duty to collaborate and work together because it has now been proven that, if one of us is in danger, we are all in danger! This is not a hollow formula nor a superficial generalization.\nThe cost in human lives and economic loss is a concrete demonstration of the danger of inaction.\nIn order to save lives, protect the most vulnerable and rebuild on a more solid foundation, we must act urgently make a long-term commitment. Yes, times may appear bleak! But, as the German poet Friedrich Holderlin would say, \u201cwhere the danger is, also grows the saving power.\u201d\nLong live international solidarity! Long live international cooperation! And long live the United Nations!\nThank you for your attention."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nDistinguished Heads of State and Government,\nMr. Secretary General,\nYour Majesties, dear Delegates,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nAt the outset, I wish to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Volkan Bozkir of the Republic of Turkey on his unanimous election as President of the United Nations General Assembly at its seventy-fifth session. Please be assured, Mr. President, of the support and cooperation of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea.\nI would also like to express my gratitude and appreciation to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande of the sister Federal Republic of Nigeria, for his leadership and magnificent work at a particularly sensitive time. We wish him every success in his new endeavours.\nI would also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, for his contribution to the search for peace and development in the world. As fate would have it, our commemoration of the seventy- fifth anniversary of the creation of our great Organization has coincided with the greatest health catastrophe that humankind has had to face in recent years, namely the coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has entered our lives abruptly, with a significant number of human victims in addition to incalculable collateral damage to the global economy. Humankind must show solidarity, as we are stronger when we act together, cooperate with one other and share our experiences. Only strengthened cooperation will lead us to the eradication of this pandemic.\nCOVID-19 is an enemy to us all and must be fought as such. It is not enough to eradicate it \u2014 it is equally important to agree upon measures to expedite post-COVID recovery, which requires emergency action to accelerate and enable rapid growth and stimulate the economy with the aim of a swift return to normality, leaving no one behind. That also demands common efforts and, in that regard, we agree with the United Nations in its call for a global response to the crisis.\nMr. President,\nUnity and solidarity were decisive factors 75 years ago when the United Nations was created in response to the results of the Second World War. The victors of the war, despite their conflicting interests, were able, for a moment, to unite and put the salvation and liberation of the world before their own interests, which was an absolute priority and necessity due to the damage and devastation caused by the war.\nThey were able to create this great Organization with the objective of preventing the world from the scourge of war.\nThe Charter of the United Nations is the foundation of international law and multilateralism, which have proven to be the best tools to face the challenges of humankind and to make our planet a more just, prosperous and peaceful place. There are no viable alternatives to multilateralism, nor to the prevalence of the spirit of the Charter.\nSeventy-five years have passed and the world is obviously no longer the same, but the values and spirit of the Charter remain. While the United Nations has played an important role in the resolution of many conflicts, it has been instrumental in the struggle for decolonization and has addressed humanitarian crises in many regions of the world.\nAt the same time, it is important for the United Nations to adapt to the current times and realities. It must be reformed on the basis of justice, equality and solidarity. We support the reforms undertaken by the Secretary-General, which must lead the Organization to be more effective, more agile and closer to the people and their problems. The main organs of the United Nations must be reformed. We need a revitalized General Assembly with greater influence on Member States.\nBut the organ that best portrays the current immobility of the United Nations is the Security Council, which clearly no longer reflects the reality of today\u2019s world. Therefore, Equatorial Guinea remains firmly aligned with the demands contained in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, which state, in short, that Africa must not be underestimated nor disadvantaged in any way. The historic injustices against the African continent must be repaired. It is ironic that, while African issues make up 75 per cent of the agenda of the Security Council\u2019s agenda, Africa\u2019s voice is stifled and underprivileged in that organ when it comes to addressing issues of vital importance to the continent.\nMr. President,\nEquatorial Guinea firmly believes in the three pillars of the United Nations, namely development, human rights and peace and security, which have inspired our political direction when designing the programmes that guide our political action. We therefore defend the supremacy of international law, which is based on the Charter of the United Nations. The Charter is the result of jointly agreed rules that are based on the sovereign equality of States, non-interference in the internal affairs of other States and respect for their territorial integrity. Any misinterpretation of those principles leads directly to confrontation. International conflicts and disputes should be resolved by peaceful means and in accordance with the principles of justice and international law.\nAll States must refrain from the threat or use of force against the integrity or political independence of another, or any other act that runs counter to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\nMr. President,\nEquatorial Guinea\u2019s term as a member of the Security Council came to an end in In December 2019, where its voice was heard loud and clear. The contribution of our country was perceived on an equal footing with the most important countries in the world in the search for solutions to major issues of international peace and security and stability. We have contributed independently and rigorously to the fight against the drivers of conflicts in the world, including phenomena such as mercenaries, as well as playing a part in the pacification and resolution of many wars.\nOur departure from the Security Council does not, in any way, imply that we have given up on our goals; on the contrary, we have reaffirmed them and will use the valuable experience we have acquired to continue fighting for peace and security and prosperity in the interest of the entire world.\nThe international community must combine its efforts to help Africa implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development alongside the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063; begin work on building infrastructure in the areas of health, education, economy and trade; and focus on addressing the problems facing Africa in the areas of youth, women, refugees and employment with a view to improving socioeconomic development in African countries.\nThe Security Council should strengthen communication and coordination with the African Union Peace and Security Council; create mechanisms for joint planning, decision-making, assessments and briefings; undertake joint work in the areas of early warning and the strategic review, design and deployment of mandates in order to enhance cooperation.\nMr. President,\nThe sad reality is that most of the conflicts affecting the world are still active, including long-lasting conflicts such as the situation in Syria, the clashes in Libya, the war in Yemen, the Arab-Israeli conflict, the situation in Afghanistan, instability in the Middle East, the conflict in the Central African Republic and the war in Somalia. These conflicts, among others, remain unresolved without clear and just solutions and are aggravated by phenomena such as the illicit trafficking of small arms and light weapons and the plundering of natural resources.\nWe are even more concerned about the situation in the Sahel where, despite the significant efforts deployed, the necessary stabilization of the situation has not been achieved, preventing this troubled region of Africa from optimizing its undeniable potential.\nEquatorial Guinea believes that political changes should be made only through democratic means and that the use of force to achieve political objectives is unacceptable.\nStability in Africa will have repercussions throughout the world. If Africa does not succeed in satisfactorily resolving its problems, then other continents will not be able to achieve sustainable stability \u2014 for instance, thousands of our young people are risking their lives on dangerous journeys to migrate to other shores. Denying the evident globality of the world will lead us only to perpetuate the common problems that require our joint efforts.\nMr. President,\nEquatorial Guinea requests the lifting of the economic, financial and commercial blockade against Cuba so that this country can optimize its enormous potential and meet the needs of its people.\nThe phenomenon of climate change deserves the same attention of the international community. It has already had devastating effects on our lives in the form of hurricanes, cyclones, fires and floods, inter alia. The degradation of the environment negatively impacts many of the activities that sustain a large part of our people, so we must urgently mobilize to find a lasting and sustainable solution to this phenomenon.\nIn conclusion, Mr. President, we hope that the world will choose the path of solidarity. If we unite in our efforts \u2014 which are by no means insignificant \u2014 and focus them in the right direction, we can make today\u2019s world a better place and ensure a peaceful and promising future for present and future generations.\nThank you very much."

        "file_text": "The United Nations was born after the Second World War out of a global consensus on the need to maintain international peace and security and to promote friendly relations between nations. These relations were to be based on respect for equality and the right of people to self-determination, without resort to force or the threat of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any nation and in any manner inconsistent with United Nations principles. But where are we in all of this? Do these principles and values truly govern today\u2019s international relations? Or have they become mere talking points for political and media consumption?\nIf we are honest with ourselves, we must admit that the answer is clear. We are straying further every day from the principles and values that underpin the United Nations and international norms. This is because some governments have illegally imposed their own agendas on other nations and have used the United Nations for the sole purpose of furthering those agendas.\nParadoxically, the main theme for this year\u2019s General Debate is \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism \u2014 confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action\u201d. But quite frankly the situation today does not bode well for the future we want, nor does it reflect the United Nations we need. We want a secure and prosperous future, free from terrorism, occupation, and inhumane sanctions. We want a future that respects international law and promotes dialogue and understanding between nations. We need a United Nations that upholds the principles and purposes of its Charter and unequivocally stands against wars and warmongers. We need a United Nations that supports its members while avoiding politicization, illegal interference, and attempts to destroy nations and communities. This is what we have wanted all along. This is what we need today more than ever before. This is more true as we confront COVID-19, which has posed global humanitarian and socioeconomic challenges that have spared no nation. It has created exceptional conditions to the extent that we are forced to address each other today remotely and through pre-recorded statements. The important question is: will this new reality compel some to put aside their narrow interests and return to the right path?\nToday\u2019s imperative is that we combat this pandemic together through multilateral joint action, with deeds and not with words alone, to build a more equal world, better equipped to withstand crises and achieve real sustainable development for all.\nThis is what we hope and work towards. Unfortunately, the reality on the ground is the complete opposite. Political agendas continue to take precedence over humanitarian agendas. As the COVID-19 pandemic rages across the world, unilateral coercive measures imposed on Syrian people and other peoples are being renewed instead of lifted. New measures, such as the so called \u201cCaesar Syria Civilian Protection Act,\u201d are being added under false pretexts. \u201cThe Caesar Syria Civilian Suffocation Act\u201d would have been a more fitting name. When the delivery of lifesaving medications and medical equipment is blocked in the middle of a pandemic, does that really protect civilians or does it deprive them of treatment? When efforts to rebuild Syria after the destruction brought by terrorists are obstructed, does that really serve Syrians or does it reduce employment, worsen living conditions, and prevent the return of refugees and IDPs? When wheat fields are burned down, oil fields are looted, and the energy sector is targeted, does that really protect civilians or does it deny them access to food, heating, gas, and electricity?\nI could go on, but I think it\u2019s clear that the real purpose of the Act is to put pressure on Syrians, their livelihoods, and their daily lives. It is an inhumane attempt to suffocate Syrians, just like George Floyd and others were cruelly suffocated in the United States, and just like Israel suffocates Palestinians on a daily basis. Though the tactics may differ, the essence is the same.\nUnilateral coercive measures imposed by some countries clearly violate international law. The humanitarian exemptions they repeatedly invoke do not exist on the ground. These are false claims intended to cover their inhumanity and save face. We call on all affected countries and those that reject such measures to close ranks against them and alleviate their impact on our peoples. This should happen through cooperation, coordination, and concrete political, economic, and commercial means.\nMr. President,\nWe all keep repeating in our statements that terrorism is a constant danger to stability and prosperity across the world and one of the main threats to international peace and security. Unfortunately, some, if not many, do not act on these statements. All relevant Security Council resolutions have yet to find their way from the UN archives to implementation. Our joint actions haven\u2019t risen to meet the threat posed by terrorism. To the contrary, there are those who invest in, support, and fuel terrorism, moving terrorists from one region to another and from one country to another, all in the service of their suspicious agendas.\nOf course, when it comes to sponsors and financiers of terrorism, the current Turkish regime reigns supreme. The Turkish regime is one of the main sponsors of terror in Syria and the region. It has facilitated the passage of tens of thousands of foreign terrorists into Syria and continues to provide all forms of support to Al-Nusra Front and its affiliated terrorist groups that have massacred Syrians. It carries out a \u2018Turkification\u2019 and forced displacement policies in the territories it occupies in Syria. And in what can only be considered a collective punishment against a million civilians that have rejected the Turkish occupation in Hasakah and a dozen other towns, the Turkish regime has deliberately and repeatedly cut the city\u2019s water supply, endangering the lives of civilians, especially in the COVID-19 pandemic. In legal terms, this amounts to a war crime and a crime against humanity. By the way, this is the same criminal behavior that terrorists exhibited when they cut the water supply to millions of civilians in Damascus in 2017. Then, just like today, the self-styled human rights defenders did not even lift a finger.\nTo make matters worse, the Turkish regime has failed to commit to the Astana outcomes and the Sochi agreements on Idlib. It has moved terrorists and mercenaries \u2014 referred to by some as \u201cmoderate opposition\u201d \u2014 from Syria to Libya.\nIt has violated Iraq\u2019s sovereignty, used refugees as bargaining chips against Europe, and laid claim by force to energy resources in the Mediterranean. The current Turkish regime has become a rogue and outlaw regime under international law. Its policies and actions, which threaten the security and stability of the whole region, must be stopped.\nMr. President,\nThe continued illegitimate presence of American and Turkish forces on Syrian soil meets all the legal conditions of an occupation. The Syrian Arab Republic will spare no effort to end this occupation by all means possible under international law. The actions of these forces, taken directly or through their terrorist agents, secessionist militias, or manufactured and illegitimate entities, are null and void, with no legal effect. They are a flagrant violation of Syria\u2019s sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. In this regard, we condemn once again all the crimes of the so-called Global Coalition committed since the start of its illegal intervention against Syrians in the Jazira region. These include syphoning the oil, preventing farmers from selling wheat to the Syrian state, attacking towns and Syrian army checkpoints, and destroying houses and infrastructure.\nI also condemn the actions of the so-called SDF. These secessionist militias are plotting against Syria\u2019s unity and its people and looting its resources. They detain and kill civilians that oppose them in northeast Syria and assassinate regional figures. My message to them is simple: stand with your country and learn from history before it\u2019s too late.\nHis Excellency President Bashar Al-Assad, president of the Syrian Arab Republic, made our position clear on all of the above, when speaking before the elected members of Parliament:\n\u201cIn the middle of global convulsions and in the throes of chaos, obfuscation, and lies, we will not lose focus. We will not miss the target. Just as our enemies\u2019 policy is one of supporting terrorism, our policy is to decimate terrorism and liberate remaining territories to restore our territorial integrity and protect our people. Timing will depend on the readiness of our armed forces to march into battle. When the battle starts, we will not distinguish between homegrown terrorists and foreign ones. We will not differentiate between terrorists and occupying forces. We will not make a distinction between Zionists, Turks, and Americans. On our territory, they are all enemies.\u201d\nIn this regard, I pay tribute to the Syrian Arab Army for their sacrifices. It was in large part thanks to them that we have been exceptionally successful in our war on terrorism. I would also like to thank our allies and friends for their valuable support and assistance in this noble fight.\nMr. President,\nThe Syrian government has always engaged in the political process. We have participated openly in talks in Geneva, consultations in Moscow, and meetings in Astana. We have dealt positively with the outcomes of the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi, including the formation of a committee to discuss the constitution. We have had serious and constructive conversations with the Special Envoy for Syria, in the leadup to the formation and convening of the Constitutional Committee in Geneva. We hope that the committee will succeed. Success, however, is only possible if there is no external interference whatsoever in its work and by any party. Since the committee was formed and started its work, it has become the Master of Itself. It is up to the committee to decide its methods of work and its recommendations. The whole process from A to Z must be exclusively Syrian-led and Syrian-owned. Syrians have the sole right of determining the future of their country.\nMr. President,\nIsrael persists in its systematic and grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the Syrian Golan, occupied since 1967. These include settlement construction, racial discrimination, arbitrary detention, torture, and looting of the Golan\u2019s natural resources. Over the past few years, Israel has also supported terrorists and launched repeated attacks on Syrian territories. It is worth noting that, as these violations continue, the so-called international community has remained silent. Some have even supported Israel and perpetuated the occupation. This is yet another sign of the hypocrisy of these countries who only champion human rights when it suits them politically.\nThat being said, it is delusional to think that the difficult situation we face in Syria could change the fact that the Golan has and always will be part of Syria, and we will not rest until recover it fully, up to the borders of 4 June 1967. This issue is not subject to any bargaining, blackmailing, or statute of limitations. No illegal Israeli action and no US decision will change anything at all. They are null and void and carry no legal effect under international law and relevant UN resolutions, notably Security Council resolution 497 (1981).\nMr. President,\nAs a matter of principle, Syria reiterates our steadfast support for the right of the Palestinian people to establish their own independent state, with Jerusalem as its capital, along the lines of 4 June 1967. Refugees must be guaranteed the right to return to their homeland in keeping with international law and relevant UN resolutions. We condemn the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Israel in the occupied Palestinian territories. We hold countries supporting Israel responsible for the implications of these crimes. Any decisions, steps, or deals that run counter to relevant UN resolutions and violate Palestinian rights are untenable and void in form and in substance.\nMr. President,\nSyria renews its support for the Islamic Republic of Iran against the US policy aimed at undermining the nuclear agreement and destabilizing the region. Such policy reflects the US administration\u2019s disregard for international law and their obligations under international agreements. Syria also condemns the unjust economic embargos on Cuba and Venezuela. We stress that the sovereign rights of these nations must be respected, and we reject any form of interference in their internal affairs.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "Your Excellencies,\nThe 75th UN anniversary and the 75th anniversary of the signing of the UN Charter is an important jubilee for the entire mankind.\nThe Republic of Serbia strongly supports multilateralism and principles of the UN Charter.\nSovereign equality of the countries, denial of use of force, non-interference in internal matters of other countries, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, peaceful resolution of conflicts and respect for differences are the principles whose validity has never been and must never be questioned.\nBig changes in the international scene brought by the 21st century only make the need for strict observation of the UN Charter and its well-known basic principles stronger.\nIn this year of big jubilees, we mark at the same time the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. As a representative of a country and people who suffered a lot and had many victims in fighting Nazism and fascism, I want to convey that it is our common duty to keep the memory and learn from the most devastating conflict in modern history, as well as to jointly confront any attempt of relativization of ferocious crimes from the Second World War. Only with the help of lessons learned from the bitter past we can build a new, brighter vision of future.\nThe Republic of Serbia is not among the big countries, neither by its territory nor by its population.\nThat is why the United Nations General Assembly is a place of utmost significance, a place where the small ones as well have the right and opportunity to make their points, and defend them with arguments.\nThat is why I am honored to address you today on behalf of the Republic of Serbia, a country that is firmly committed to the policy of peace and prosperity for the entire mankind.\nThe debate we are having today in virtual format speaks for itself about the situation of today\u2019s world and it is a confirmation that we must do anything to preserve and strengthen the United Nations and the General Assembly, as the most important forum where opinions of all member states on the most important topics of global importance can be heard.\nThe topic of this year\u2019s debate reminds us of the importance of multilateralism as the founding principal of the United Nations. We firmly believe that only by joint actions, mutual harmonization and respect, answers can be found in facing global challenges such as the ongoing Pandemic of the Communicable Disease COVID-19.\nThe pandemic additionally emphasized the need for close and intensive international cooperation, whereby UN and its specialized agencies and organizations, like the World Health Organization, have the irreplaceable role in organized response to newly occurred challenges that are not only of a health nature, but they also have socio-economic, political and security dimension.\nCOVID-19 pandemic strongly confirms the need and necessity of existence and strengthening of the role of the United Nations. The relevance of this forum must never be questioned.\nWe firmly believe that only by mutual cooperation, harmonization of positions and mutual respect, a global response in facing this modern plague can be found.\nThe United Nations we need, both today and in the future, must be adapted to newly occurred circumstances and ready for joint response to the modern age challenges.\nIn that regard, the existing situation is the opportunity we must take for promoting system of international coordination and support.\nPrecisely in that regard the United Nations must have a key role and that is why we need to work continuously on adapting, strengthening and efficiency of the United Nations system, because it is the best way towards full achievement of the idea of multilateralism.\nNewly occurred reality in the world is another proof that modern challenges know no borders of the countries.\nSerbia is also facing problems in fighting this disease that caused tectonic changes worldwide and we received assistance of the friendly countries when we needed it the most, and I take this opportunity to thank them once again.\nI have to say many thanks to our European partners, to our Chinese friends, and to our Russian friends as well.\nLikewise, we showed solidarity and provided assistance to other countries and we will keep helping those who need it most in these difficult times.\nI avail myself of this opportunity to extend big gratitude for help and support provided by the United Nations and the World Health Organization to the Government of the Republic of Serbia in fighting pandemic.\nOn the other hand, and beside already allocated financial support for strengthening response of healthcare systems to COVID-19, we will keep supporting the World Health Organization, as well as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI) as a leading stakeholder in the field of immunization.\nEven though the pandemic has shaken the strongest world economies, I have to say that Serbia managed to keep stable budget, as well as the entire fiscal and monetary system which is fully prepared to withhold assistance measures for economy, which is open for potential investment plans.\nWe invested huge efforts in order to help survival of our economy, firstly thanks to disciplined and responsible management of public finance. Despite of the crisis effects, Serbia has excellent results in economy in the first two quarters of this year and we have strong reasons to believe that by the end of the year we will remain among the most stable economies in Europe.\nWe are not a rich country, and I will say also that we are not a poor country, but we hope that by the end of the year we\u2019ll have the biggest growth rate in entire Europe. So far, in the first six months, we became the first country \u2014 at least the country with the biggest growth rate, and I hope that we will be able to continue in the same manner.\nDear Friends,\nFull membership to the European Union is a foreign policy priority of the Republic of Serbia. However, our European path does not exclude commitment to development of cooperation and deepening relations with countries from all regions. We cherish partnership relations with the Western countries, including more intensive cooperation with the USA, but at the same time we are proud of exceptional relations with the Russian Federation and the People\u2019s Republic of China. And, as you can see, we don\u2019t hide that, we are very proud of our friendships. Cooperation with friendly African, Asia-Pacific and Latin American countries is also in the focus of our foreign policy activities.\nAdditionally, improvement of regional cooperation is the basic starting point of our foreign policy and we believe that in relations with our neighbors we have acted as a responsible and reliable partner. We are committed to preservation of regional stability and intensifying cooperation in all areas, being that it contributes to reconciliation process, closer connectivity and development and it is to the benefit of the citizens of the entire region.\nWe are aware of the seriousness and complexity of the problem in relations with some of our neighbors and we are committed to resolving them exclusively through dialogue, taking into consideration interests of all interested parties.\nIn that context, Serbia strives to put special emphasis on the development of economic cooperation, believing that such approach may contribute to raising mutual trust, confidence, and thereby easier resolving of open issues.\nGuided precisely by the need to promote economic cooperation and create favorable investment climate in the Western Balkans region, in the fall of 2019, together with the Prime Minster of the North Macedonia and Albania, Zoran Zaev and Edi Rama, we inaugurated the initiative directed towards enabling freedom of movement of people, goods, services and capital, and much closer cooperation between our three countries.\nI want to underline that the initiative is open for other stakeholders from the Western Balkans and I hereby invite them to join, being that its essence is to be fully inclusive for everybody in our region.\nWe believe that European perspective of the region was and remains important incentive for necessary reform processes and promotion of cooperation. We believe that without full integration of the Western Balkans to the EU, common economic and political space in the European continent will not be complete and we are convinced that enlargement policy is not only in the interest of the citizens of the Western Balkans, but also in the interest of the European Union.\nI am pleased that even in this difficult period caused by the COVID-19 pandemic a very high level of mutual solidarity in the region was demonstrated, which is to a great extent precisely the result of constructive and proactive relationship that Serbia has been building in previous years with its neighbors. We have cooperated intensively with regional countries related to both repatriation of citizens and related to issues of humanitarian and medical assistance, but also regular supply of goods.\nDecision on establishing \u201cGreen Corridors\u201d in our region was a useful one, which enabled smooth transport of assistance, without delays at border and administrative crossing points.\nYour Excellencies,\nYou are familiar with our problem regarding preservation of the territorial integrity of Serbia, i.e. efforts to resolve \u2014 despite all the obstacles, the issue of our Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija. Precisely the politics of Serbia for preservation of peace and stability, cooperation and economic progress I\u2019ve mentioned earlier, is a sufficient incentive for approaching resolving this long lasting problem, in the best interest of the both Serbs and Albanians.\nOn this path, we were and we will face numerous pressures because Serbia is at the crossroads where different political interests collide. We believe that it will be possible to reach a solution after the long and difficult dialogue, but rest assured that Serbia will never agree to humiliations. Accepting anything that is not compromise is not for us. And, by compromise, both sides must be equally either satisfied or dissatisfied.\nRecent renewal of the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue under the EU auspices, after almost two years of deadlock, is by all means the first step on that path.\nAdditionally, big step forward in finding mutually acceptable solution for the issue of Kosovo and Metohija is a recent signing of the agreement on economic normalization in Washington, D.C., which involves a set of economic and infrastructure projects, which should enable better life for all citizens in that part of our country and of our region.\nI take this opportunity to underline and praise very constructive and important role that the administration of the President of the United States of America Donald Trump played in reaching this agreement, which is an important signal of their commitment in finding lasting and sustainable solution for this important issue.\nDialogue between Belgrade and Provisional Institutions of Self-Government in Pristina, which has continued in Brussels with the EU intermediation, is the real path for reaching sustainable agreement between two sides, but the starting point can by no means be humiliating and unacceptable so-called independence of Kosovo.\nDespite of everything, we believe that the agreement between Serbs and Albanians is a key to regional stability. The Republic of Serbia remains committed to finding compromise solution for the issue of Kosovo and to building common future with the politics of peace and cooperation.\nLadies and Gentlemen, Your Excellencies,\nThe Republic of Serbia is not committed only to peace and security as well as to social and economic prosperity in the national and regional dimension, but it is also aware of the importance of active engagement in these areas globally. We attach big importance to the UN efforts in promoting and preserving peace and security worldwide and we actively participate in the collective security system.\nBy continuing the tradition of Yugoslavia\u2019s participation in UN peacekeeping missions, started in 1956, representatives of Serbia are actively engaged in UN and EU peacekeeping missions. It is with great pride that we underline that we are the leading country in the Western Balkans region, and the 9th biggest contributor on the list of leading European armed and police forces in UN missions.\nAdditionally, Serbia will continue contributing fight against terrorism through full implementation of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and relevant Resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.\nAdoption of the Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 as well as Paris Climate Change Agreement are key steps in facing some of the biggest challenges today \u2014 global economic instability, growing social inequality and climate change effects.\nDear Friends,\nThe UN Charter should be a \u201cConstitution\u201d of the modern international community, collection of basic principles regulating international relations and processes in international community one must not stand back from.\nUnfortunately, at the very end of the 20th century, in my country we were witnesses and victims of unilateral measures and activities that undermine and question not only the efficiency of multilateralism and international cooperation mechanisms, but the international law itself.\nThe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, at that time, was bombed without the consent of the United Nations Security Council, whereby the UN Charter was most severely violated.\nAfter that, with a unilateral action by which the Provisional Institutions of the Self-Government in Pristina declared independence of the so-called Kosovo, UN SC Resolution 1244 (1999) was violated and stability of the Republic of Serbia, but also of the entire region, was seriously endangered. Let me remind you that the Republic of Serbia is fully committed to finding compromise solution for the issue of Kosovo and Metohija. Our politics is a responsible one; we do everything to protect the interests of our people, but also regional peace and stability.\nBy defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity and by observing the UN SC Resolution 1244 (1999), the Republic of Serbia at the same time defends the international law, the UN Charter as well as the supremacy of the Security Council.\nWe believe that it is essential to further strengthen in the upcoming period efforts for preservation of principles this Organization was founded on 75 years ago. We are convinced that the role of the United Nations in these processes was and remains irreplaceable. Rest assured that the Republic of Serbia will continue to act as a serious and reliable partner in achieving common goals, strengthening cooperation within the United Nations and building better future for all of us.\nLike I have already said, the Republic of Serbia is not within the group of big Countries, neither by its territory nor by its population. But, judging by its culture and contribution to science, our Country is among the most developed nations.\nUNESCO which with special piety emphasizes our medieval art and I dare say the most significant man of the 20th and 21st century, our scientist Nikola Tesla, proves our contribution to civilization and common good. The time frame between the White Angel fresco, the first painting that went to Orbit, and Tesla, covers the period from renaissance to our contemporaries.\nIn its striving towards lasting peace and common wellbeing, Serbia obliged itself to military neutrality. We rightly believe that it is one of the strongest messages of peace that went from the Balkans to the world.\nThe great American artist Isidora Duncan said after the Great War:\n\u201cViolence by the big and powerful can often be turned against them. The best example that the great should not brutalize the small is the example of the small Serbian nation, which put an end to an empire that had lasted almost a thousand years.\u201d\nSerbia despises any kind of violence. Serbia wants peace and prosperity, for itself and for the entire mankind. Serbia wants peace for its region.\nThank you for your attention and stay safe"

        "file_text": "Thank you very much. It is a pleasure and an honour to share the Assembly Hall with all of you.\nAt no other time has Latin America seen more clearly that it must choose between the two roads that lie before it.\nThe two roads do not lead \u2014 as many intellectuals in the region have asserted \u2014 either towards the left or the right; statism or neo-liberalism; or socialism or capitalism.\nThe two roads, one of which we must choose, are simpler. One is the road of freedom and the other is the road of oppression.\nIn other words, we are once again faced with the dilemma that arises between the choices of democracy or dictatorship. In short, we are faced with the dilemma of modernity.\nDid we create the State to oppress or to guarantee freedom? Ladies and gentlemen, it is time to choose.\nLet us admit that, in general, Latin America has not overcome the threat of authoritarianism.\nAnd let us concede that very important people in Latin American politics remain in the thrall of authoritarian temptation.\nAnd, consequently, let us accept that many of our societies are at risk of surrendering to new forms of authoritarianism and oppression.\nAnd what are these new forms of authoritarianism that threaten several of our nations?\nThey are simply the pursuits of caudillismo and authoritarian populism.\nThey encourage the appropriation and, if necessary, kidnapping of public life by a caudillo and his caste.\nIt is not matter of parties, the armed forces, unions or ideologies. In sum, it has nothing to do with any organization or institution conceiving of the common good.\nIt is about individual pursuits of power.\nThose pursuits aspire to see the Caudillo and his caste gain complete control of the political sphere, culture, the economy and ultimately the freedom of the people.\nThey are founded on the idea of privilege. And, for that reason, run contrary to the idea of rights.\nIt is the system of the few. It is the system of castes. It is the system of the political elites. It is the system of the political clan.\nIn short, Latin America has before it the road offered up by caudillismo and authoritarian populism. But it also has another path, which is different and opposed to caudillismo and authoritarian populism, respects the people and is based on democracy. In effect, after having lived through the populist era, Latin America has the option of building political coexistence, based on the republican tradition \u2014 which is the tradition of freedom.\nThat is the road we are building in Bolivia. It is the road leading towards returning power to the people. It is the road leading towards validating the rule of law.\nIt is the road leading towards overcoming more than a decade of populist and authoritarian caudillismo. It is the road leading towards restoring the freedom of the citizens.\nAnd it is precisely in order to build that road to freedom that we are supporting fair and transparent elections on 18 October.\nAnd we are supporting them despite the fact that the proponents of caudillisto populism attempted to stop and sabotage them with brutal and violent actions a few weeks ago.\nThose actions included blocking highways so that oxygen intended for patients who had fallen ill to COVID-19 would not get by. It was an extraordinarily inhuman and cruel way of sowing chaos and terror. Such actions led to death and damage, which under the eyes of the law can clearly be seen as crimes against humanity.\nThe Bolivian people, however, courageously and determinedly stopped the organized and systematic attempt to overthrow democracy and reinstall the dictatorship in Bolivia. We are a people who have decided to turn the page and leave behind the populist dictatorship.\nWe are a people who no longer want to see Governments building palaces or museums dedicated to the caudillo. We are a people who want democracy, health care, employment, education and opportunities.\nAnd that is why the decision of the current Government to invest 10 per cent of the national budget in health care has been a very important step for Bolivia.\nAnd that is also why the efforts we have made in health care have been very important in achieving in three months what had not been achieved for decades in our country. They involved thousands of health-care jobs and other initiatives to equip hospitals and treat free of charge thousands of citizens who contracted the coronavirus disease.\nSimilarly, in keeping with the purpose of establishing the Republic \u2014 the Government of the people, the Government under the law for all and the Government devoted to political freedom \u2014 we have established in Bolivia a support system for the people, which is unprecedented in our history.\nThe pandemic reminded us of the enormous importance of helping one another.\nIt reminded us of our Christian value to care for one another. And it reminded us of the ethics of mutual help as a path leading towards healthy coexistence among people who consider themselves to be brothers and sisters, free and equal.\nThe support and assistance system that we have established is based on the providing cash vouchers to the population \u2014 directly to all Bolivian families, with special emphasis on the people and families who are most in need.\nWell then, in view of the two roads of freedom and oppression, which I took the liberty of expounding upon, it is a pleasure to say in the Assembly that Bolivia has chosen the road of freedom.\nBut I would be remiss if I did not conclude my statement without condemning before the world the systematic and abusive assault that the Kirchnerist Government is carrying out from Argentina against the institutions and republican values in Bolivia.\nWe have nothing against the noble Argentine people. Moreover, it is a nation that we esteem and love like a brother. We have nothing against Peronism, which we value as a political tradition \u2014 the national popular tradition \u2014 and has been the driving force behind enormous achievements in the social modernization of Argentina.\nIt is a tradition that we are familiar with in Bolivia where the 1952 Revolution, which exemplified the national popular tradition, set the stage for extraordinary progress with regard to equality and social justice.\nNor do we harbour any bitterness towards other Governments, such as the Government of Havana, with which we do not agree ideologically. But we maintain the due respect and courtesy that characterize the relations between two sovereign States and between two brotherly peoples, who share a common history.\nBut the case of the Argentine Government is different. It involves behaviour that I described earlier when I spoke of the populist castes, which do not hesitate to use frankly abusive methods to carry out their plans, obtain power and take stands that run contrary to promoting freedom.\nWhat is the Argentine Government\u2019s authority to make interference the key to its foreign policy towards Bolivia? And what is its authority to protect a violent conspiracy by Evo Morales against Bolivian democracy from Argentine soil?\nAnd even worse, what is the authority of the Argentine Government to offer impunity to Evo Morales in cases as serious as the national and international investigations that are under way against this former dictator, for human rights violations, for sexual violations against girls or underage women, or for complicity in political murder?\nKirchnerist populism knows that the Bolivian nation is not the private property of any caste. We are a sovereign and respectable people.\nBolivia is respected. Bolivian democracy is respected. The Bolivian people respect themselves.\nNor can I fail to mention the maritime issue in this speech. I call on the international community in these new times to resolve through negotiation and fraternal understanding the critical and pending problems between States, such as the Bolivia\u2019s lack of sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean.\nLadies and Gentlemen:\nBolivia has chosen freedom. She has chosen the republic. And no matter who your enemies are, the important thing is that democracy, freedom, institutions and republican values have come to stay in Bolivia.\nWe invite the world to look at our electoral process, which, unlike that promoted by Evo Morales last year, will be clean and free of fraud. We invite the world to look at our system of aid, bonds and solidarity, which has launched in Bolivia a historic stage of assistance to those who need it most.\nWe invite the world to visit us, because we are a people that, despite so many political, social, economic and health difficulties, now looks forward with courage, freedom and joy.\nThank you very much. God bless you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nIt is an honour to participate in the opening of this historic 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly. On behalf of the Republic of Nauru, I would like to congratulate Your Excellency on your recent assumption of the Presidency. Let me assure you of my delegation\u2019s full cooperation and support as you steer our important work during this session.\nI would also like to thank His Excellency Mr. Tijiani Muhammad-Bande for his exceptional leadership during this unprecedented time as our outgoing President.\nMr. President,\nIn light of the current global challenges that face the international community, it is more critical than ever to have a United Nations that is fit for purpose. Many countries were caught off guard when a tiny virus exposed systemic vulnerabilities in our global and national institutions on how we protect and care for our people. Your chosen theme for this session \u201cThe Future We Want, the United Nations We Need: Reaffirming our Collective Commitment to Multilateralism \u2014 Confronting COVID-19 Through Effective Multilateral Action,\u201d is timely and appropriate.\nFor a country like Nauru, as one of the smallest UN member state and most vulnerable, we looked to the leadership of the World Health Organisation mandated to promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable.\nBefore the outbreak of the pandemic, we heard cases of a new virus spreading across the globe and we waited in anticipation for the WHO\u2019s guidance and assessment of the situation.\nFollowing WHO\u2019s declaration of the outbreak as a pandemic, Nauru responded immediately by declaring a State of National Disaster for the Management and Preparedness of COVID-19 in March of this year. This action enabled this government to address our national emergency responses to the pandemic. Our goal like many of yours, is to protect the people and citizens of Nauru.\nWe also recognised that WHO played a leading role in managing the Pacific region\u2019s response which later led to the formation of the Pacific Humanitarian Pathway for COVID 19 (PHP-C). This new modality - developed for the purpose of consolidating donor funding into a regional mechanism proved onerous, confusing and thus ineffective. At the height of any crisis we should not alienate further the people we are supposed to help. We should not miss out simply because we did not do it right or because we lack the capacity to navigate our way through new modalities of operations.\nWhile we recognise these are unprecedented times, we believe that the UN has the capability, the expertise and the know-how to deliver effectively in times of crises and taking into account the challenges faced by the smallest members.\nOur experience is that access to, support and assistance in a timely manner, is critical to ensure the effectiveness of the PHP-C. We also found ourselves competing against each other for much needed resources and those of us who have had far greater experience in engaging with the United Nations system was better placed to access the support required.\nMr. President,\nFortunately, I am pleased to share that my small island country, Nauru remains free from COVID. For us this is truly a milestone achievement.\nThis government took steps to enact national laws to support new policies and measures to deal with the pandemic. We created a national COVID Taskforce to ensure that our responses are coordinated and coherent taking a whole-of-government approach working with the private sector, civil society and the community at large. We took measures to secure our borders by implementing travel restrictions with quarantine protocols while at the same time have an open and controlled border policy in place. We used the borders of other countries as our bulwark. This is our capture and contain policy.\nMr. President,\nWhy does this government place such importance on the effectiveness of our national and multilateral responses to the pandemic?\nAllow me to put this into context. Nauru has a land area of 21 square kilometres and a circumference of 19 kilometres. The population is estimated roughly at 11,000 and the expected growth rate of 4.5 per cent, which by 2050 will make us 27,000 people.\nTaking this into account Nauru has had a history of population decimation. In the 1920\u2019s the population was ravaged by the influenza epidemic and again by the scourge of the Second World War. These external factors threatened the very survival of our people and nation with the population falling dangerously below 500. We struggled to bring the level up to 1,500 to gaining independence in 1968 and become a sovereign nation.\nOur history therefore reminds us that an outbreak in one part of the world can produce a catastrophic and devastating effect on this tiny country. The lessons of the past cannot go unheeded.\nThrough the Grace of God \u2014 we remain COVID free today.\nMr. President,\nOur experience has shown us that the World Health Organisation was slow in declaring the pandemic. This tells us there is much room for improvement. We must ensure that every country regardless of size is not left behind. We must do more.\nAt the regional level, Nauru is one of the 10 countries covered by the United Nations Multi-Country Office in Fiji and benefits the least. The pandemic exposed the weakness of the UN Development System and the disconnect between a coordinated regional response to meeting our national needs and priorities. The pandemic has also taught us the need to be better prepared next time. Greater investment needs to flow into our public health systems to build our capacity and capability for future pandemics.\nAllow me to applaud the efforts of the Secretary-General in spearheading the reform of the United Nations development system to be more effective and fit for purpose, in particular, we look forward to the early establishment of a new multicountry office in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). We view this as a positive step that will enable a responsive, focused and targeted support coordinated between the North Pacific small island developing States (SIDS) and the United Nations.\nMr. President,\nDespite the sometimes-dour commentary on the current state of multilateralism, I think it is important to acknowledge the strikingly prolific decade we have just concluded here at the United Nations. Our commitment to multilateralism has delivered historic agreements on sustainable development, climate change, disaster risk reduction, and development finance, just to name a few. This body of work, which reflects the views of every UN Member State \u2014 from largest to the smallest \u2014 has the potential to deliver a more resilient, more just, and more equitable world.\nYour challenge, and ours, is to bring these agreements to fruition as a matter of urgency. This will be the test of multilateralism going forward \u2014 Let\u2019s not fail this.\nMr President,\nOne of the core pillars of Nauru\u2019s sustainable development strategy is economic sustainability, consistent with this objective this Government launched its Desperate Imagination Vision this year. The vision is one of innovative thinking towards a financially sustainable and resilient Nauru. We placed emphasis on boosting all partnerships and identified the need for strengthening these networks to help us realise our vision for a financially sustainable and stable future.\nNo longer can sustainability be brushed aside as an issue and that in the language of Nauru \u201cwill take care of itself\u201d because alternate means to sustain the economy are now more important than ever. Sustainability of the nation must be front of mind now and always.\nAnd in this regard, this country holds a dubious distinction as the only country denied access to concessional financial resources from the World Bank. Nauru is currently ineligible for International Development Assistance (IDA) grants and concessional loans, because our GNI per capita exceeds the current threshold for small island economies. We are also barred from receiving loans from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) because the World Bank has determined that our economy does not generate sufficient revenue to service new loans. Why are other countries given access to these financing tools and not Nauru?\nNauru may be an extreme case, but it is well in line with the experience of many developing countries which, despite the best of development plans, cannot access the financial resources to actually implement them. This state of affairs was shameful before the pandemic, but it is now a crisis in its own right. Years, perhaps decades of economic gains across the developing world could be at risk without a rapid response from the Bretton Woods Institutions to relieve countries of unsustainable debt burdens and provide fiscal resources for a robust economic recovery.\nWe need a global financial system that is more responsive to the urgent needs of developing countries, and I strongly urge you to take on this issue as part of your effort to reaffirm multilateralism.\nMr. President,\nMany have compared the humanitarian impacts and economic disruption of COVID to what we might expect from climate change. Therefore, I think it is important that we recognize foresighted leaders on this issue. Today, I would like to specifically thank the Government of Germany for continuing to place the issue of climate change and security before the United Nations Security Council.\nThe most basic responsibility of any Government is to protect the safety and security of its citizens. Failure to do so risks social and political unrest. It is now uncontroversial that climate change will make it more difficult to fulfil this most basic responsibility of government by undermining food and water systems, increasing competition over declining natural resources, disrupting global supply chains, and displacing communities. Most of these challenges exceed the capacity of any one nation to address alone. Therefore, addressing the security implications of climate change requires a multilateral response.\nWe believe these functions are best taken up by a new Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Climate and Security.\nHowever, we will only succeed in protecting the security of vulnerable countries and communities if our political system shows the courage to make the fundamental changes that the climate crisis requires.\nWe want a United Nations that addresses the climate crisis by taking urgent action, safeguard us from an economic regression and depression that will further exacerbate the existing inequalities among nations.\nMr. President,\nLimited land space is an overarching challenge for us.\nNauru will need to accelerate efforts on the Higher Ground Initiative which is reclaiming the 80 per cent of mined-out land located at the central plateau of the island. Climate Change exposes environmental risks for coastal dwelling. We have begun preliminary scientific assessment on our physical environment to collect data that will contribute to informed decisions. We are still in the very infant stages and recognise this is only the beginning of a very long journey. Laying the right foundation is critical for future generation to continue the work we have started.\nWith innovative planning and the incorporation of sustainable best practices, we are confident that the Desperate Imagination Vision can bring about jobs, cultivate new business trade and investment opportunities, and also restore our natural environment. Combined with construction of the new, GCF-funded port facility, our new shipping line and our national carrier, Nauru can become a regional hub of commerce, including our aspiration for a regional health and sports tourism industry. This is our pathway to achieving our Sustainable Development Goals.\nHowever, we cannot do this alone. And this is where our renewed commitment to multilateralism must focus \u2014 on mobilizing the means of implementation for those that need it.\nMr. President,\nIt would be remiss of me to not to recognise that Nauru is a big ocean state. We are highly dependent on marine resources for its sustenance and economic development.\nUNCLOS as the constitution of all ocean activities had the foresight to provide opportunity for developing States like mine to participate in the new seafloor mineral industry and balance the historical disparities that exist between the North and South.\nSpecifically, I am speaking to the important work of the International Seabed Authority (ISA), as the international body tasked with organizing and controlling all mineral resource-related activities in international waters for the benefit of mankind as a whole, while ensuring the effective protection of the marine environment from harmful effects that may arise from deep seabed related activities.\nIt gives us the confidence in the development of the new regulatory regime for the collection of seafloor minerals, the ISA will ensure that this new industry will be managed responsibly while providing benefits for all mankind. Moreover, this will help us achieve SDG Goall4, namely Targets 2 and 7, on the sustainable management and protection of marine ecosystems and increase economic benefits to SIDS, respectively.\nI encourage ISA members to continue to work towards a timely development of the regulatory regime. I also commend ISA\u2019s capacity-building development programme and in particular the Abyssal Initiative for the Pacific Sponsoring States.\nMr. President,\nOur efforts in responding and containing the coronavirus would not have been possible without the valuable support rendered through our development partners and for this we are truly grateful to our genuine friends Australia, Taiwan, New Zealand, India, Japan and the United States.\nWe also ask our friends the United States to not forget the people of Cuba who are also struggling like us under this pandemic.\nMr. President,\nSeventy-five years ago, the nations of the world came together to draft a charter that would stand the test of time. It was created on the principles of universality and equality, respecting the worth of every individual. It is not enough to proclaim the virtues of multilateralism if we fail to strengthen our commitment to upholding the core principles of the Charter.\nWe therefore call on the United Nations to fulfil our commitments to the human family and ensure that the 23.5 million people of the Republic of China (Taiwan) enjoy the same rights as the peoples of other nations. While the world grapples with the COVID pandemic, the people of Taiwan must not be left behind, nor should its exemplary response to the global pandemic be ignored. Taiwan is an important partner in the world\u2019s response to this pandemic. More than ever today we need inclusivity and solidarity in responding to the global challenges we face.\nMr. President,\nAs we forge ahead in a future that is covered with COVID-19 and other things that we really do not know, \u2018Let\u2019s hand-in-hand, shoulder-to-shoulder as Scripture tells us, walk forward to meet the challenges of tomorrow\u2019.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nMay God bless the Republic of Nauru and may God bless the United Nations."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, I am honoured to deliver this statement on behalf of the President of the Republic of Tunisia, Mr. Kais Saied, as His Excellency\u2019s contribution to the general debate of the seventy-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly.\nIn the name of God, most compassionate, most merciful,\nMr. President of the United Nations General Assembly,\nSecretary-General of the United Nations,\nYour Majesties and Excellencies,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nIt gives me pleasure to begin by congratulating Mr. Volkan Bozkir and the sisterly Republic of Turkey on presiding over the General Assembly at its seventy-fifth session. I wish him every success in his tasks.\nI would also like to express our great appreciation for Mr. Tijjani Muhammad- Bande for his able leadership of the seventy-fourth session.\nI also reiterate my appreciation for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and express our continued support for his work and initiatives to strengthen the role of this international Organization.\nThis session coincides with the seventy-fifth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations. It is an opportunity to review the Organization\u2019s work and explore the ways to develop it further so that its organs become more effective and flexible in order to meet the aspirations of the peoples of the world to peace, security, democracy and development, and to embody the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations.\nThis session also coincides with a very critical international situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has raised unprecedented challenges and has had serious repercussions on international peace and security and on the socioeconomic conditions around the globe. These challenges and threats highlight the urgent need to promote international cooperation and human solidarity while energizing multilateralism further. That would contain their effects, lead to establishing collective and proactive strategies and constitute the core of international action.\nI reiterate on this occasion Tunisia\u2019s commitment to the United Nations Charter. We believe in the importance of this international Organization and we are ready to maintain our contribution to its activities and the pursuit of its goals. As a member of the Security Council, Tunisia continues to shoulder its responsibilities and actively participate in our collective efforts to consolidate international peace and security; prioritize preventive diplomacy; promote political settlements of conflicts and disputes; mitigate the effects of humanitarian tragedies; and support international efforts to address the various challenges and threats posed to our peoples. Tunisia also renews its commitment to participating in peacekeeping operations around the world.\nResolving the Palestinian question based on the resolutions of international legitimacy, the terms of reference of the peace process and the Arab Peace Initiative is an urgent priority and main entry point to restoring regional and world peace and security.\nThe situation in our sister nation Libya is a source of deep concern. We again underscore that military action and foreign intervention cannot be a solution. Such choices further complicate the crisis, deepen the suffering of the Libyan people and threaten security and stability in Libya and the wider region.\nTunisia once more welcomes the ceasefire agreement in sisterly Libya and underscores its firm commitment to doing its utmost to assist our Libyan brothers in reaching a political settlement through inclusive Libyan dialogue, under United Nations auspices. We also call on the international community to uphold its responsibility to establish security and find sustained and comprehensive solutions for the various disputes and crises in our region and the world.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has deepened the crises on our African continent. Tunisia stresses its commitment to continuing to work with our African brothers and international partners to achieve sustainable and comprehensive development and overcome the challenges we face together. In this context, we reiterate our support for silencing the guns in Africa. This initiative is an ongoing effort that needs greater international support in order for the African continent to be free of conflict and to focus on construction and development.\nTerrorism and violent extremism continue to represent one of the most serious threats to our nations and peoples and to international peace and security. The scourge is worsening and exploiting ongoing crises and the activities of organized crime in certain countries and regions. That threat now targets States themselves, social cohesion and their efforts for development and democracy.\nWhile there has been important progress on the issue of counter-terrorism through national, regional and international efforts, the threat persists and requires us to coordinate our efforts at all levels. We must intensify cooperation to counter plans of terrorist organizations and extremists in order to protect our societies and our people, in particular the young.\nMay peace and God\u2019s mercy and blessings be upon you."

        "file_text": "President,\nExcellencies,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nThe United Nations was founded on hope \u2014 the hope for a better tomorrow in the aftermath of war. As we meet today, 75 years later, COVID-19 is putting us all to the test: Will we tackle the largest global challenge since the UN was established?\nBuilding on the lessons from other crises and infectious diseases, Norway continues our unwavering commitment to the UN and multilateral solutions. In response to the pandemic, we took the initiative to establish a UN COVID-19 response and recovery fund, and we are co-chairing the global effort on access to COVID-19 tests, treatments and vaccines \u2014 the ACT Accelerator.\nWe stand firm in our conviction that global problems need global solutions.\nPresident,\nThe goal of the UN is a world of peace and security. A world ruled by justice and respect for human rights. A world that acts decisively to reduce inequality, poverty and hunger. Acts to stem climate change. And acts to build resilience against pandemics and other global threats.\nWe celebrate 75 years of the United Nations. In the next seventy-five years, how many new conflicts will emerge? How many new refugees will flee from destruction and persecution? How many girls will attend school? How many children will be vaccinated?\nWhatever old challenges remain and new challenges arise in the next 75 years, the UN must be at the centre of our coordinated efforts.\nThis is why we continue to invest both financially and politically in this organization.\nI would like to pay tribute to the many deeply committed women and men who represent the United Nations across the globe. Civilian as well as uniformed. You deserve our gratitude and respect.\nPresident,\nIn June, Norway was elected as one of five incoming members of the UN Security Council. We are grateful for the strong vote of confidence from the Member States. We are preparing for this assignment fully aware that it is one of the most important and demanding tasks in international politics.\nThroughout our campaign, we strengthened bilateral bonds with all UN Member States. We pledged to listen and engage. To be open for dialogue with all countries. We will honour that commitment.\nIn addressing country situations on the Security Council\u2019s agenda, Norway will focus on four thematic areas in particular.\nFirst, we will use our experience from peace diplomacy to help fulfil the UN\u2019s untapped potential to prevent and resolve conflicts and sustain peace.\nSecond, we will build on the women, peace and security agenda and promote women\u2019s participation in peace processes. Only an inclusive process can lead to sustainable peace for all.\nThird, Norway will focus on the protection of civilians, including children, based on international humanitarian and human rights law. We will give special priority to preventing and combating sexual violence in conflict.\nFourth, Norway will bring climate-related security threats into the discussion. We must acknowledge that people living in conflict zones are among the most vulnerable to climate change, and that climate change in turn increases the risk of conflict.\nThe Security Council has a primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. The Council should investigate any dispute or situation that might lead to international friction. And the Council should apply appropriate measures to stop aggression or prevent escalation of conflict.\nThis is at the heart of the Security Council, and at the heart of the UN. Because there can be no development without peace.\nPresident,\nHuman rights, the rule of law and democratic principles are the building blocks of just, peaceful and prosperous societies. Societies where citizens are protected and leaders are held accountable.\nToday, we are witnessing a different trend towards more authoritarianism and populism. Civil society, human rights defenders and media workers are increasingly coming under attack. The basic human rights of women are being undermined. Minorities are being targeted and vilified.\nThe pandemic is amplifying this negative trend. We have seen examples of the pandemic being used as a pretext to weaken democratic principles and human rights.\nThe pandemic is an exam in practical governance for all states. The report card will be open for the world to see.\nWe must ensure that human rights, democracy, the rule of law, and gender equality are at the core of our response and recovery efforts.\nOnly then can we hope not only to soften the fall, but to build back better.\nPresident,\nI am shocked and saddened by the increase in violence against women and girls as a result of ongoing lockdowns across the world.\nWomen are bearing the brunt of the pandemic in many societies. Women are on the front line as health care workers. At the same time, women\u2019s own access to health care is heavily affected. Denying women access to sexual and reproductive health services can lead to more maternal deaths, more teenage pregnancies and more child marriages. We must ensure that women and girls are protected. That they have access to health care. And that women have access to financial incentives for response and recovery.\nNorway has a long tradition of promoting women\u2019s rights and gender equality. We know from our own experience that it is not just the right thing to do \u2014 it is the smart thing to do. Gender equality is well worth the investments. If we are to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals, gender equality must be integrated in all our efforts. We must invest in girls and women. In their education, in their health, and in their participation in the labour market. Increasing their opportunities and levelling the playing field pays great economic dividends.\nPresident,\nEradicating poverty is the greatest global challenge.\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is our plan of action for people, for the planet and for prosperity.\nThere is a danger that this pandemic may reverse years of progress on the SDGs. It has laid bare the weaknesses in our common systems. Extreme poverty is increasing, jobs are being lost at an unprecedented scale, and children are being deprived of their education. We have no alternative but to take decisive action now, and redouble our efforts to reach the sustainable development goals.\nIn our continued quest to achieve these goals, national ownership and resource mobilization is crucial.\nProgress requires financing. We acknowledged this in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on financing for development. Funding sustainable development is more critical now than ever. The pandemic has exposed and compounded structural inequalities in all countries. Our response must focus on helping those furthest behind. The Addis Agenda highlights the importance of domestic resource mobilization in order to provide basic public goods and services.\nYet public goods and services, such as health care and education, remain underfunded. We need to stop the drain on public resources. We must prevent corruption, tax evasion and other financial crime.\nTo this end, Norway in its capacity as ECOSOC President launched a High- Level Panel on Financial Accountability, Transparency and Integrity \u2014 the FACTI panel \u2014 together with the President of the 74th General Assembly. The Panel will review current challenges and offer recommendations related to illicit financial flows.\nIt is a common responsibility of all Member States to make sure there are no safe havens for the proceeds of crime, corruption or tax evasion.\nPresident,\nWe need a healthy planet to fulfil the SDGs.\nMany Member States are facing climate related disasters \u2014 more frequent and more dangerous than ever before. The most vulnerable among us are hardest hit. The threat to small island states is existential. The people in the Sahel are among the most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Yet they are among the world\u2019s lowest emitters of CO2. It is our common obligation to invest in resilience, especially in the parts of the world most adversely affected by climate change.\n2020 remains the crucial year for countries to update and strengthen their national climate targets under the Paris Agreement. In February, Norway submitted an enhanced climate target for 2030. I encourage other countries to enhance their ambitions, especially the large economies. We must also give priority to further development of rules and cooperation under the Paris Agreement.\nNorway is actively speeding up the green shift in our economy, making it cheaper to be green, and more expensive to pollute.\nPresident,\nThe oceans are a vital factor if we are to reach the Sustainable Development Goals. The COVID-19 crisis has underlined the importance of the ocean economy. We need to build back not only better and greener, but also bluer.\nA sustainable ocean economy holds benefits for health and society, as well as for the global economy and environment. Every dollar invested in key ocean actions yields 5 dollars in return, often more. Actions include increasing sustainable seafood production, decarbonising international shipping, scaling up offshore wind power and conserving and restoring mangroves.\nResponsible resource management increases the potential for economic growth.\nTwo years ago, I convened the High-level Panel on Building a Sustainable Ocean Economy, together with the president of Palau.\nThe panel is comprised of fourteen distinguished members. On December 3rd we will present ways forward to better protect our ocean and release the enormous economic potential it holds.\nOur recommendations are based on the best advice from more than 150 international scientists and a wide network of business and NGOs. We will invite the international community to join this call for ocean action leading up to the UN Ocean Conference in Lisbon next year.\nPresident,\nI would like to draw attention to the challenges seafarers are facing in this crisis. Around 500,000 seafarers currently await to disembark or embark ships and vessels globally.\nAlmost 80 per cent of the world\u2019s trade is transported by ship, including food, medical equipment and energy products. If the crisis persists, it can lead to major disruption of global trade, supply chains and the world economy. I encourage all Member States to designate seafarers as key workers and to implement the International Maritime Organisation's protocols for crew changes.\nPresident,\nCOVID-19 is putting us all to the test. Information, research, treatment and vaccines must be shared in a way that leaves no-one behind. If not, we all stand to lose.\nI started by saying that the United Nations was born out of hope. While we can always do better, I find hope in the way we have come together in this race against time. We are united against a common enemy. We have been reminded of a simple fact: We are in this together. There is no stronger argument for our continued support for the United Nations.\nThank you, and stay safe."

        "file_text": "Mr. President\nMr. Secretary General\nExcellencies\nDistinguished Delegates\nI would like to present warm greetings of His Majesty The King, Her Majesty The Queen and the people of Bhutan, from the land of Gross National Happiness.\nTo begin with, we express our solidarity with the international community as we cope with COVID-19. We offer prayers for lives lost to the pandemic and we wish strength to their loved ones.\nMr. President, I would like to congratulate you on your election as the President of the 75th Session of the General Assembly. I assure you my delegation\u2019s full support in the discharge of your important responsibilities. I also commend your predecessor\u2019s exemplary leadership in steering the 74th Session of the General Assembly.\nCOVID-19 and Bhutan\u2019s unique story\nLike never before, at least in our lifetime, we are witnessing a pandemic that has heavy bearings on our lives and livelihoods.\nBut, it is comforting that the UNGA is happening around this time. It provides us a platform to share and learn from each other in these extraordinary times. And I know all nations represented here are always ready to lend their ears on matters of global concern.\nWe are tackling COVID-19 as a single global community. We came this far sharing knowledge, information, experiences and evidences on the disease. I thank you all for the support. Bhutan has learned a lot in this exercise.\nAnd today, I seek your attention as I share the COVID-19 story of our small Himalayan Kingdom. This story revolves around a compassionate, wise and an astute 21st century King. A King we view with divine reverence and yet is so learned about every modern detail.\nHis Majesty The King has always been the symbol that held Bhutan together in its purpose and pursuits. It was always his Royal priority to protect the people of Bhutan at all times.\nAnd in this pandemic, our King spearheads the battle to guard the country from the virus, making sure all Bhutanese, home and abroad, are safe and their spirits uplifted.\nAnd then, we have Her Majesty The Queen, so passionately complementing all of His Majesty\u2019s efforts.\nUnder direct supervision of our King, we have meticulous surveillance systems in place. Which includes close monitoring of our international entry points and timely institution of 21 days quarantine, which is mandatory for everyone entering Bhutan and fully sponsored by the government. Reliable and free testing facilities are also set up across the country.\nWe have a professional health minister leading the team to execute every detail of the royal guidance. All these are being ensured without any compromise on routine health services like vaccination, MCH and NCD packages. And as I share this with much sense of achievement on this forum. I cannot help but thank all our frontline workers.\nReciprocating the royal initiatives, all Bhutanese have gladly embraced the new practices of wearing face masks, maintaining physical distance, hand washing and avoiding unnecessary crowding to complement the efforts of the government. I am very grateful to the Bhutanese people for their support.\nIt is through this act of unity that we managed to keep the number of cases low. As of today, we recorded 261 positive cases, of which 192 have recovered. Mortality from COVID-19 remains zero.\nOn all occasions, His Majesty expresses appreciation to the people for their hard work and solidarity. And in turn, people have their hearts filled with gratitude and devotion for our King. This unconditional unity under His Majesty\u2019s leadership is the most distinct winning factor in our fight against COVID-19.\nCOVID-19 and GNH\nFor anything to thrive, we need a fertile ground. For Bhutan, to display innate qualities of harmony, we have the ambience of Gross National Happiness. It builds around the intrinsic values of interdependence, humanity and compassion.\nAs a key component of GNH, our visionary monarchs emphasised on protection and preservation of our environment. We have the Constitutional mandate to ensure 60 percent forest cover at all times and to maintain \u2018inter-generational equity\u2019 of our natural resources.\nSo today, when the world is dealing with issues of climate change, we are grateful for the wise decisions that kept Bhutan carbon negative.\nSimilarly, our Constitution mandates free healthcare and education for all Bhutanese. Our monarchs have always insisted on strengthening the social sector saying it is an investment not an expenditure.\nDespite being a resource constrained country, access to these sectors is not an issue for the Bhutanese people. Which is why our existing public healthcare system needed only minimum adjustment to cope with the pandemic.\nI personally feel this pandemic brought out the very essence of GNH, which seeks wellbeing of the people, not just of oneself but everyone around us. This disease, being highly contagious, requires us to act responsibly, so that our actions don\u2019t compromise the safety of those who are more vulnerable.\nUnderstanding the pathophysiology of COVID-19, as a medical person, I am convinced that until we have effective vaccine the combination of professionally designed and well implemented physical distancing (which in extreme sense is called lockdown), and easily accessible and reliable testing is the best approach.\nOur lockdown template elaborates three phases that adds up to three weeks, followed by 10 days of gradual unlocking phases. Bhutan experienced our first lockdown last month. To break the chain of transmission, people cooperated by staying home all through, allowing front-liners to do their jobs day in and out. (COVID-19 and social, economic interventions)\nEven before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, His Majesty expressed concerns that Bhutan will not be spared by this outbreak. He reminded us that if we are not strategic, the health crisis could easily lead to economic problems and subsequently to social crisis.\nWhich is why, all interventions to look after the livelihood of the people , are designed within the magnanimity of our King. The conventional fiscal and monetary measures attend to the affected entities and individuals. Special teams are formed to look after both informal and formal sectors.\nHowever, His Majesty\u2019s biggest concern is for those who could fall into the cracks within the system, which happens particularly in times of crisis. Thus, the King\u2019s Relief Fund ensures no one is left behind.\nThe royal intervention goes to the extent of taking care of the interest payment on all loans of the citizens for a year. A special package is designed for the elderly and people with co-morbid medical conditions. Besides other social supports, essentials are delivered at their doorsteps. This unique feature is designed particularly to protect the most vulnerable group.\nHis Majesty has always commanded that we should not lose even a single person to the disease. Hopefully, with all these interventions, we will be able to live up to our King\u2019s expectations.\n75th Anniversary of the UN\nWe all know UN has come a long way and achieved major milestones. When the UN celebrated the 25th anniversary, it was on the theme of Peace, Justice and Progress. Despite challenges, we have seen so much improvement in these areas.\nTwenty-five years later, on its 50th anniversary, it committed to the theme of poverty eradication. Had it not been for the pandemic, we were well on track.\nAnd the theme for the 75th anniversary on \u201cmultilateralism\u201d cannot be more relevant. Like climate change, COVID-19 also knows no borders, and similarly affects developing countries disproportionately.\nWe do not know what is coming next. We also do not know when SARS- CoV-3 will hit us. In that sense, are we not interconnected? Is there a second option to multilateralism? These are questions we must keep asking ourselves frequently peaceful coexistence among ourselves and with the nature around us is the best vaccine for humanity to thrive on this planet.\nIn this small, intricate world, while fighting a highly infectious disease, it will be a big blunder if we do not help the developing world to have access to all the critical resources including vaccine when it actually becomes available.\nI emphasize on the global message of no one being safe until all of us are safe. This is so true that for a highly contagious disease, you can never be safe until everyone else is safe.\n2030 Agenda of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\nNow let me touch a bit on the SDGs, the universal goals for our sustainable future.\nFor us, the SDGs resonate well with our developmental plans based on the principles of GNH. For the same reason, Bhutan was on track to become an early achiever of the SDGs, as shown by the voluntary review in 2018.\nBut these were the goals set before the pandemic. Our planning commission is closely studying the impact of COVID-19 on our developmental plans. Even otherwise, trends around the world and back home offer evidence enough that we will now be falling short of the targets.\nAll 17 SDGs are interconnected, and not a single sector will be spared by the consequences of this pandemic. Most obvious ones are the goals on health, education and our economy.\nIf individuals or agencies or even governments are re-aligning with the realities of COVID-19, shouldn\u2019t we revisit SDGs too? I feel it is time to field a special team to work on a new framework of SDGs, which should encapsulate all elements that will help us walk the path of new normal with more prudence.\nLDC graduation\nJust as we see the need to review the whole SDGs, this pandemic has also derailed us off the LDC graduation track. Our current plan was designed to help Bhutan graduate from LDC category in 2023. Now everything has changed, as our focus has shifted to saving lives and livelihoods from the challenges posed by this pandemic.\nWe know millions are pushed back into poverty, and more lost their jobs. We would have gone back by decades. Bringing our developmental achievements back on track will not be easy. And for some developing countries, it will be almost irreversible.\nTherefore, I would like to request the UN to reset this global developmental path and help us regain our grip for smooth transition from the LDC category.\nUN Reform and Peacekeeping\nMr. President, at a time when the relevance of multilateralism is often questioned, Bhutan\u2019s faith in the Organisation remains unwavering and firm. The challenges we face as a global community are numerous and multifaceted for individual states to tackle on its own. From our perspective, there is no alternative but to work together.\nAt the same time, the UN must also evolve and match the changing realities. In particular, the existing structure and composition of the UN Security Council do not reflect the current realities and circumstances of the world.\nBhutan has also long supported the aspirations of the G4 to serve as Permanent Members to an expanded Security Council, of course, with Africa also appropriately represented.\nAs a peaceful country, we have enjoyed the benefits of the UN membership for almost five decades. We joined the fraternity of troop and police-contributing countries in the year 2014. Since then, our engagements in peacekeeping operations have gradually increased. We stand ready to be deployed at all times. (Conclusion)\nExcellencies, ladies and gentlemen, with health and education being the priority of this government, may I remind you that last year I shared with you all, the gratifying news of making our teachers the highest paid civil servants in my country.\nWith such historic initiatives, my government was excited to redefine our education system that was not just about school enrollment and conventional teaching. We were going all out to engage our children in learning process that is meaningful, and built around relevant skills and innovation.\nBut it is disappointing when we have to opt for online and distant learning due to circumstances. This robs our young minds of opportunities to play and eat together with peers and teachers on the same campus.\nIn the process, they are deprived of all the values of human connection, which we all know, have huge psycho-social impact. We may not realize it today but will have to bear the brunt down the line. It could impact an entire generation of our children if we are not mindful of that today.\nThe COVID-19 has revealed a stark fact that our investments in these social sectors are far and lacking. No one can be sure when SARS-CoV-3 might trigger another pandemic.\nTherefore, we must redesign our developmental path and double up our investment in these social sectors. Going forward, relevantly educated and healthy global citizens will have to be at the heart of the new normal.\nIf we all are convinced that spending more on health and education is an investment and not an expenditure, if we live by this commitment it would be a different ball game hereafter.\nThat way, when we celebrate UN\u2019s next milestone, the 100th anniversary, we would have achieved 100 per cent literacy rate, which empowers everyone with relevant skills and knowledge for a meaningful life.\nThis would also enable everyone to be 100 per cent digitally competent to help them derive advantages of technology from all corners of the world.\nAnd as a medical practitioner, it would be wish fulfilling if our health system improves so much that our life expectancy touches 100 years when UN turns a century in 2045.\nFinally, in wishing the 75th session of the UNGA every success, we send prayers for good health and happiness of every living being on this planet.\nThank you and Tashi Delekl"

        "file_text": "Mr. President of the General Assembly,\nMr. Secretary-General,\nDistinguished delegates,\nLet me begin by warmly congratulating His Excellency Ambassador Volkan Bozkir of Turkey, on his election to the prestigious post of General Assembly President.\nMr. President, Albania is honoured to serve, under your leadership, as Vice- President of the 75th session of the General Assembly, representing the Eastern European Group.\nYou can fully count on our committed support and partnership, throughout this historic session.\nMr. President,\nDuring the 75 years of existence of the United Nations, we have had plenty of reasons to be proud of. As a result of global cooperation in the framework of the UN, we have managed to prevent major military conflagrations and reduce human suffering.\nThe 75th anniversary of the United Nations is a historic milestone and should serve as a time of reflection on how to strengthen the UN and make it more effective in addressing the global and unprecedented challenges that our societies are facing.\nMr. President,\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into a deep health and economic crisis. Its socio-economic consequences will certainly play out for many years to come, with unpredictable consequences for global peace and security.\nThe current crisis threatens to slow down and even reverse the progress on the new Sustainable Development Goals.\nFood security, poverty eradication, economic development, climate change and gender equality are at stake, exacerbating the existing vulnerabilities and inequalities within and among countries.\nHow we respond will determine how fast the world recovers, and will shape our ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and manage other global challenges.\nThe global response to the coronavirus pandemic has tested multilateralism and exposed the limitations of existing international institutions. But it has also demonstrated the alarming consequences of faltering global cooperation.\nThe pandemic has shed a new light on humanity\u2019s need for a strengthened multilateral system, based on the principles and ideals enshrined in the UN Charter and the international law.\nThe United Nations should be at the centre of an inclusive and effective multilateralism, where international organizations, financial institutions, civil society, the business community, and other stakeholders, operate through closer institutional links.\nIn this regard, we strongly support the vision and the ambitious reform agenda of the UN Secretary-General. Albania is convinced that a reformed United Nations will deliver a more integrated and system-wide approach to achieve the 2030 Agenda and make sure no one is left behind.\nDistinguished delegates,\nAt this critical moment, we must respond to the fears and hopes of the people we serve.\nIn order to flatten the curve of the pandemic and prevent a global economic crisis, we must react collectively, in the spirit of unity and solidarity.\nI would like to take this opportunity to commend the United Nations for mobilizing support in terms of personal protective equipment and other medical supplies to more than 130 countries, as well as to ongoing efforts to accelerate research and development for a vaccine, which should be affordable and accessible to all the people across the globe.\nMr. President,\n2019 was a difficult year for Albania. We were struck by two powerful earthquakes, which left more than 50 people dead and a billion of US dollars in damages.\nWe are grateful to those friendly nations who helped us in our time of need, and provided financial and in-kind support to our ongoing reconstruction efforts.\nWe are also grateful of the support that we have received from the United Nations, that proved to be a true partner.\nIts agencies were engaged from day one. Rescue and relief experts were deployed immediately, supporting our national authorities alongside partners from Europe and elsewhere.\nAnd then COVID-19 hit. The World Health Organization has accompanied our response every step of the way. Jointly, the UN has also prepared a socio-economic response plan to ensure coordinated action across the UN, and efficient support to the national response.\nAlbania is working hard to achieve the United Nations global goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent in the next decade, and to net zero emissions by 2050, in accordance with Paris Agreement.\nIn addition, we have adopted the Strategy on Climate Change and the Mitigation Action Plan of greenhouse gas emissions.\nAs Albania strives to make full use of its economic potential, we have aligned our national priorities and objectives to the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and the National Strategy for Development and Integration.\nVery important objectives of this Strategy are the protection of Roma and Egyptians communities, persons with disabilities, and other potentially vulnerable and marginalized groups.\nProgress has also been made in terms of gender equality, with the number of women working in state institutions and public administration growing by the day.\nMr. President,\nWe need to pay special attention to the needs of the most vulnerable groups, especially to those of young people. The economic effects resulting from the pandemic will lead to increased numbers of unemployed young people, prompting them to flee their country of origin.\nThis is undoubtedly a global threat, affecting especially those countries with fragile economies.\nDistinguished delegates,\nAlbania\u2019s OSCE Chairmanship 2020 is a tangible demonstration of our steadfast commitment to promote international peace and security through dialogue and multilateral co-operation, at a time of raising tensions and polarisation.\nIn its capacity as Chair of the OSCE, Albania has strongly supported the call of the United Nations Secretary-General for a global ceasefire.\nIn order to continue to actively participate in creating stability and security, Albania has presented its candidature for election as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, for the mandate 2022-2023.\nAlbania firmly believes that multilateralism is key in tackling global challenges. We will offer a proactive contribution to international peace and security through our own regional experience, as a key factor for peace, stability, and security.\nWe will take an active, constructive, and mature approach and we will act with responsibility to strengthen multilateralism through partnerships and cooperation.\nI seize this opportunity to call on all the esteemed nations of the General Assembly to support Albania\u2019s Security Council bid for 2022-2023.\nMr. President,\nIn today\u2019s complex and interconnected world, modest countries like Albania may not be expected to compete with their economies and material assets.\nThey can, nonetheless, contribute in enriching the world with what they have most precious: identity, history, culture, traditions and values.\nOne of the traditions that we value and cherish the most it\u2019s the unique interreligious harmony that reigns in Albania.\nAlthough Albanians traditionally belong to different religious \u2014 they have peacefully lived side by side, since times immemorial. When Pope Francis visited Albania in 2014, he spoke of \u201creligious fraternity\u201d.\nLast year, we organized in Albania a regional conference, \u201cReligion as an Instrument for Peace\u201d, in collaboration with the US State Department, with the aim to advance religion freedom as a fundamental human rights issue.\nThis precious heritage of interreligious and cultural tolerance defines who we are as a nation. The exceptional story of how Albanians risked their lives to protect and rescue the Jews during the Holocaust is a remarkable expression of our spirit of tolerance, compassion and respect towards our fellow human beings.\nAlbania is proud to offer the world a message of co existence and dialogue between religions.\nIt\u2019s a message that can serve as a powerful antidote against rising intolerance and violent extremism that undermine peace and security.\nDistinguished delegates,\nEuropean Union accession continues to be Albania\u2019s most important strategic objective.\nEarlier this year we welcomed EU Council political decision to open accession talks with Albania.\nWe are fully aware that we need to fulfill the pending benchmarks before the first intergovernmental conference.\nThis process requires a concert of efforts at national level, with a determined government leadership heading the way towards genuine and sustainable reforms.\nRenewed commitment is expected to deliver concrete results in key benchmarks related to democratic functioning and rule of law, which will have to reflect crossparty political consensus and serve to the overall stability of the country.\nWe have expressed our sincere gratitude to European institutions and member states for their assistance in recovering from the earthquake that struck us and the COVID-19 pandemic repercussions.\nAlbania continues to fully align itself with EU foreign policy in the region, taking pride of our firm European and Euro-Atlantic alliance of shared values.\nMr. President,\nAlbania is aware of its obligations as a responsible member of the international community.\nIn its ongoing efforts to build peace and security, Albania has contributed with troops, under the umbrella of UN, EU and NATO, in different peacekeeping operations in South Sudan, Kosova, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mali and Afghanistan.\nOur primary goal and interest are to ensure lasting peace and stability in our region, the Western Balkans.\nOur region has had a tragic history of dictatorships, oppression and military conflicts. Despite the difficult legacy that still haunts the region, significant progress has been made over the past two decades, largely thanks to the cycle of reforms triggered by the ongoing NATO and European Union enlargement processes.\nWe encourage and welcome the fact that the Albanian factor continues to support the European and Euro Atlantic course throughout the region, strengthening at the same time regional cooperation and ownership of ambitious projects.\nWe welcome the agreement on economic normalization between Kosova and Serbia, brokered and guaranteed by the President of the United States, Donald Trump.\nWe remain hopeful that this agreement will inject new dynamism in the relations between Kosova and Serbia.\nBoth countries should seize this opportunity to conclude a final and legally binding agreement of mutual recognition and full normalization of their relations, with the mediation of the European Union.\nAlbania strongly believes that the Republic of Kosova is an exporter of security and stability in the Balkans.\nKosova has established a solid constitutional and legal framework that provide for unprecedented protection of the rights of minorities and their cultural heritage. This is fully in line and often exceeds the relevant European acquis in terms of human rights protection.\nKosova is today a member of many international organizations and regional initiatives.\nThe membership of Kosova to all the international organizations, United Nations included, would not only benefit Kosova, but also the whole international community.\nIn concluding Mr. President, I would like to reaffirm once again Albania\u2019s committed support to a reformed and reinvigorated rule-based order, with the United Nations at its centre. We, Member States, must do our part in upholding and strengthening the multilateral system in order to benefit from it.\nThank you for your kind attention!"

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nYour Excellencies, Heads of State and Government\nMr. Secretary-General\nDistinguished Delegates,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nMr. President,\nI am honoured to address the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly. I congratulate you, Your Excellency, following your appointment as President of this session. I also express my appreciation to your predecessor for his outstanding work and contribution to the success of the 74th session.\nMr. President,\nAs we commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations, it is only proper that we reflect on who we are, where we come from and where we are going. The United Nations has stood for the lofty ideal of building an international system of collaboration and common purpose. This system allows us to collectively call to account those who choose conflict over peace, it recognizes the dignity and equal worth of all people. It values each and every one of us and the input that we make towards that end.\nThough we have been faced with multiple challenges, as a collective, we have pressed forward, slowly, steadily, to forge an agreed system of rules and norms that are better, stronger, transparent and more consistent than ever before. It has resulted in an international order that has overseen unparalleled advances in human liberty, the attainment of dignity amongst peoples, given rise to prosperity and a global economy that has sought to uplift more than a billion people from poverty.\nYet we come together in reflection here, knowing that our work is far from complete, acknowledging that the spirit of cooperation that has held us bound, is faced with its\u2019 greatest challenge thus far. It is for this reason therefore that we welcome this year\u2019s theme, \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism \u2014 confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action\u201d.\nThis year\u2019s theme, rightly challenges us to critically self-examine. The 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly, must be a year when we come together to discuss our priorities as a human family, and how we can build a better future for all. It is a reminder to the United Nations to revisit and stick to the ideal that recognizes dignity, prioritizes the value of cooperation and the equal worth of all, leaving no one behind.\nMr. President,\nEarlier this year, the United Nations held a commemoration of the signing of the Charter of the United Nations, presenting an opportunity for us all to reflect on the relevance of the Charter today, and recommit to those goals and principles laid down therein. The Kingdom of Eswatini welcomed the hosting of the event and joined others in sharing our thoughts related to that initial signing and the developments that have occurred between then and now.\nFurther, we cast our sights forward to imagine the potential challenges that could arise for us to deal with. What remained as an absolute fact for us, was that, whatever challenges had come before, whatever strife we are facing today and whatever incidents as may lay in wait for us, we deal with it best, when we deal with it together.\nMr. President,\nThere is a common acceptance that multilateralism and diplomacy underpin the advancement of the three pillars of the United Nations, namely, sustainable development, peace and security and human rights, which are interlinked and mutually reinforcing, while observing respective specific mandates and the Charter of the United Nations.\nHowever, we still must recognize the inconsistencies in our collective behavior. Many of our countries continue to live in poverty amid great natural wealth. In many instances, national interests continue to impede resolution of crises. The challenge of migrant flows requires a collective approach.\nIf we continue to seek solutions in an individual manner, this will result in an impasse. This organization has become more necessary than ever to foster the kind of collective action to today\u2019s global challenges.\nMr. President,\nThe Kingdom of Eswatini, like the rest of the world, has had to deal with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For us, this came at a time when the Kingdom was faced with multiple battles against the scourges of HIV, Malaria and Tuberculosis, all of which had placed a huge strain on our resources. As a relatively small economy, we did not boast huge reserves with which to finance the fight against the new onslaught. We welcomed the recently held High-Level Event on Financing for Development in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond.\nGlobal challenges and crises have a tendency of either pulling us together or pushing us apart; true to form, the COVID-19 crisis has created an unprecedented bond between and among countries. The crisis has taught and reminded us that we belong together, irrespective of location, distance and time on this planet. This is the time in history where our reflection and focus must be candid and transformational to deeply explore the lessons we have learnt and therefore, rethink generational to shape the future we want. Therefore, this is the opportune time to ask big questions, make great decisions and commit and act in solidarity.\nMr. President,\nThe intensity of the crisis has demonstrated glaring socio-economic gaps within and between countries. It has better defined and exposed our uniqueness in financial and human resource endowment and our strength, capacity and ability to cope with challenges. The pandemic underscored that our individual strength is weak without collective but differential commitment and solidarity. It has reiterated and re-emphasized that we are living in a global village and therefore, we need each other. We can conclude that, without collective commitment to multilateralism, we will never accomplish the ideals of the \u201cDecade of Action and Delivery\u201d and pinnacle of the 2030 Agenda \u2014 to leave no one behind.\nOur community of Nations must accept the reality that the crisis has forever changed our way of life; and we must resist the temptation of reverting back to what we knew as normal, but our duty is to prepare for a \u201cnew normal\u201d. Opportunity beckons as the pandemic revealed that what we considered as normal has been shown to have lacked the ability to deliver on many socio-economic needs. Therefore, our focus should entail both response to the crisis but more so, shaping our future in the face of other possible crises.\nThe most successful preparedness and response plans must incorporate strategies that strengthen our nations beyond recovery. Relevant strategies will mark the birth of a new society that will present the future we want. There is no easy and isolated way to fix the present and prepare for the future, except through collective commitment to multilateralism. The United Nations is not only an international body, but it is a family of nations, therefore, it will always be at the center of and a catalyst to multilateralism and support the future we want, and in extension, the United Nations we need.\nMr. President,\nAt this juncture, let me commend the President of the General Assembly, Secretary General and staff of the United Nations, the international financial institutions, developing partners and everyone for the quick response and reaction to mitigate the impact of the pandemic in the midst of implementation of the 2030 Agenda and sustainable goals. Many countries have benefitted and this has not gone unnoticed. As the world committed in Rio de Janeiro in 2012, this is the opportune time to reiterate and recommit to sustainable development and promotion of an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable future for our planet and for present and future generations.\nMaking the United Nations work for us all, calls for collective commitment at individual, communal, national, regional and global levels. The pandemic has also demonstrated the weakness in the classification of our development levels, which have jeopardized many countries\u2019 opportunities to access development finance and debt restructuring, among others. It has further revealed the need to revise and extend countries\u2019 success and development beyond traditional measurements of Gross National Income, but fully consider their vulnerability, particularly in crises such as we are experiencing. Every country\u2019s needs must be considered in isolation, but tackled in the multilateral context. This will help us collectively commit to bottom- up multilateralism and help us collectively progress to the future we want and the United Nations we need.\nAs a \u2018United Nation\u2019, we must dissuade any tensions between nations that have been created by the play out of the pandemic. Every public and private institution must be ready to promote international cooperation, get better prepared to deal with future global threats and commit to multilateralism. COVID-19 has generated a strong global viewpoint where all people dread to think backward and inward but to think forward and outward, with the hope to create the world we want. Achieving effective and all-benefiting multilateralism and building back better together calls for ensuring that no one is left behind. This will entail leveraging of existing innovative partnerships, coordinating responses, refraining from protectionist measures, strengthening inclusion, investing in technologies that will sustain economic and social sectors in the midst of crises, among others\nMr. President,\nWe welcome the mandated events that are scheduled to be held on the margins of the General Assembly this year, namely the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women, the high-level meeting to commemorate and promote the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons and the Summit on Biodiversity. We trust that these events shall be a success.\nMr. President,\nAs intimated earlier, 2020 marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women and the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. This is a significant year for the accelerated realization of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls. Nonetheless, it is lamentable that though the global community celebrates the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women, no country has achieved full gender equality. Poverty, violence against women and girls, the relentless pushback against women\u2019s rights and gender equality remain prevalent across the world.\nWe believe that this anniversary is the appropriate occasion to give new momentum to action. We encourage Governments, Civil Society and other stakeholders to assess gains, identify gaps and challenges, and critically set priorities for this generation and future generations. With all the challenges the world is facing, it has never been more important to advance the elimination of all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, than it is now. We need renewed political will to deliver on the commitments made. Let us all recommit ourselves to our common goal of achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and their enjoyment of human rights, everywhere.\nIn this regard, it pleases me to note that the Government of the Kingdom of Eswatini has adopted numerous pro-gender policies that promote gender equality. Female representation in positions of power and decision-making compare favorably within our region.\nMr. President,\nAs we evaluate the current status of our Organization, we must reflect on the ongoing process of reforms. This process, is, in itself, a tacit admission on our part that change needs to happen to ensure the continued relevance of the UN and its\u2019 subsidiary bodies. The time that has elapsed since the discussions began, is a cause for concern. However, we believe that this year gives us the moral imperative to push for accelerated progress in those reforms.\nWe support ongoing discussions within the framework of the Ad Hoc Working on the revitalization of the work of the UN General Assembly (AHWG) that seeks to find mechanisms to enhance the role and efficiency of the General Assembly. We recognize the work that has gone into streamlining the work of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), in particular how it relates to the functions of the General Assembly to enhance synergies and reduce overlaps between the two bodies.\nThe reform of the Security Council is a key aspect of the process and no transformation could be complete without its fundamental reform. To this end, the Kingdom of Eswatini wishes to reiterate Africa\u2019s call for permanent membership to the Security Council in accordance with the Ezulwini Consensus.\nMr. President,\nAs we conclude, among the political issues that have continued to fester for too long is the continued denial of the right of the People of Taiwan to participate in the UN system.\nTaiwan has shown significant commitment to the ideals of the United Nations and has aligned her priorities with those of the organization. Taiwan has, further, committed significant resources to the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals, not only within her own boundaries, but going so far as to assist other Countries to do the same.\nEarlier we reflected upon those who have assisted the Kingdom of Eswatini in our fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan deserves a special mention in that regard. In these uncertain times, where resources are dwindling, Taiwan has not only expressed commitment towards collaborative global citizenship, but has shown manifest support to development initiatives undertaken by some of our countries and, in particular, the Kingdom of Eswatini.\nIn this globally interdependent world, it is crucial that we work together where we can and constructively counsel each other where appropriate. The United Nations is home to these interactions and in this role, retains the unmitigated support of the Kingdom of Eswatini.\nI THANK YOU AND MAY THE ALMIGHTY GOD BLESS YOU."

        "file_text": "Mister President,\nExcellencies Ladies and Gentlemen, Heads of State and Heads of Government,\nMr. Secretary General,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nMadagascar feels honoured at this moment when I take the floor to address our august Assembly, on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Andry RAJOELINA, President of the Republic of Madagascar, on behalf of the Malagasy People and on my personal behalf, on the occasion of this 75th General Assembly of our United Nations, during which we also celebrate its 75th Anniversary jubilee.\nMr. President,\nI express my sincere congratulations on your election and wish you every success in leading this very special session, given the highly symbolic nature of the celebratory anniversary, as I said earlier, and the exceptional situation as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which the whole world is currently experiencing and fighting.\nI also reaffirm our support for our Secretary-General in succeeding in carrying out his important mission in the service of the Member States.\nExcellencies Ladies and Gentlemen,\nGiven the seriousness of the global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and its incomparable impact on all humankind, which, among other things, has led to almost 1 million deaths worldwide, including 216 in my country, I would like to convey from this rostrum a message of solidarity, compassion and encouragement to all the nations and peoples of the world.\nIndeed, we are celebrating the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations in exceptional circumstances, separated from one another by distance, and we should see the manifestation of the world\u2019s vulnerability as an opportunity to come closer together in our common faith in our collective future based on the human values of shared peace and prosperity, which inspire the Organization.\nIn the context of the uncertainty enshrouding our shared planet, where it is undeniable that individual pursuits and gains have hit a wall with regard to common sense and effectiveness, we should become aware of what is most important in the shared values of the Organization, such as unity, solidarity among peoples and cooperation among nations.\nWe should therefore reaffirm both our commitment to what brings us together and our rejection of what divides us. We could overcome the COVID-19 pandemic through solidarity and cooperation. Therein lies the vision and true and beneficial message that we could provide and receive from multilateralism.\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nAs at the very beginning of its 75-year history, the immediate challenges facing the United Nations remain immense, as we celebrate its milestone anniversary.\nCOVID-19, a shared threat, does not discriminate according to age, gender, religion or race.\nThe profound economic imbalances and social inequalities that we have continued to fight within the Organization have been aggravated by the health crisis.\nThe situation with regard to peace, international security and human rights has further deteriorated in some parts of the world.\nSeveral national elections have had to be postponed because of the destabilization of democracy.\nThe economic crisis is widespread and the resulting social vulnerability has been significantly accentuated for millions of our peoples.\nThe unforeseen outbreak and virulence of COVID-19 has shed light on our collective shortcomings to deal with a common threat. That brings us back to the obvious need to rethink the scope and reach of the multilateralism that we are promoting so that all countries of the world can enjoy a shared source of resiliency with the appropriate tools for dealing with myriad crises like COVID-19 and avoid undoing decades of collective work within our Organization and various regional communities.\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nMadagascar has addressed the pandemic to the best of its ability and with all means available in terms of awareness raising and taking action in order to optimally safeguard its population and strengthen national resilience in responding to the COVID-19 crisis.\nSince the official March announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic in Madagascar, our country has very quickly implemented a multisectoral response strategy to better meet the challenges and their social, economic and environmental repercussions.\nThe national response was based on the following three main goals: first, to contain the spread of COVID-19 to contain the pandemic; secondly, assist vulnerable populations and effectively meet their basic needs; and, lastly, safeguard and stimulate the economy, while maintaining human capital and facilitating recovery.\nIn that regard, our major efforts were focused on establishing and strengthening governance in combating the pandemic, shoring up measures related to social protection and supporting economic resilience.\nThe response was rapidly rolled out with the adoption of major measures, such as the establishment of the Operational Command Centre at the national and regional levels and the deployment of multiple forms of social assistance to support families affected by the health crisis and vulnerable families.\nFurthermore, the State has decided to help the private sector to safeguard jobs and the means of production through unprecedented tax cuts to support the various affected sectors so that they can better cope with the consequences of the health crisis through a range of various kinds of assistance, such as the provision of seeds and agricultural inputs to farmers and food packs to affected workers; ordering more than 5 million masks from free-enterprise and small private companies; the launch of a major public investment project for infrastructure; and supporting research and innovation in producing Covid-Organics (CVO), as an modified traditional remedy to effectively combat COVID-19.\nIndeed, Madagascar has stood out with the development of CVO, which is the result of important research carried out by the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research (IMRA) \u2014 a logical consequence Madagascar\u2019s recognized status as a sanctuary of world biodiversity with an extremely varied and rich traditional pharmacopoeia.\nWith its preventive and curative qualities, CVO undoubtedly enabled Madagascar to avert a human tragedy, as opposed to what tragically unfolded in many countries around the world with the spread of COVID-19, as Madagascar implemented the wide-scale distribution of the treatment in tandem with other multiple health-care and social measures.\nDuring this ordeal, Madagascar did not struggle alone but benefited from the precious and substantial support of the international community and scientists from all walks of life, and I would like to express to all of them here, without exception, the deep gratitude of the Government and the people of Madagascar.\nFinally, on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Andry Rajoelina, President of the Republic, I pay tribute, in particular to the entire medical corps in Madagascar, the defence and security forces, all the volunteers and all those involved in providing essential public and private services for their sacrifice and tireless service in caring for and treating the sick and protecting our fellow citizens and their property, while sometimes risking their own lives. Our findings show that the spread of COVID-19 is under control in Madagascar, as the recovery rate of confirmed cases is 93 per cent, with a 1.2 per cent mortality rate. May the entire Malagasy people also be warmly thanked for their conscientiousness and understanding throughout this difficult ordeal and sacrifice combined with patriotism that they have shown during this dark page of the history of the country and all other nations of the world.\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nMadagascar believes that we must urgently make up for the time that the world has lost with regard to collective and synergistic deliberations and actions to deal with the effects of COVID-19.\nIn that regard, it has become imperative to: develop and promote a new concept involving new innovative response instruments fostering global, regional and local initiatives to come up with medical solutions, in particular treatments and vaccines; strengthen international cooperation in the area of health care to enhance the comparative advantages of every country in the multiplicity of models adapted to the level of technology and innovation of the countries concerned and advocate universal access to innovative practices and scientific data; and establish mechanisms for financing health-care systems.\nGiven the global health challenge posed by COVID-19, those proposals could be realized only through unprecedented cooperation among nations, the scientific and medical research community, the pharmaceutical industry and multilateral partners.\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nMadagascar intends to catch up in terms of its development. Within that framework, large-scale priority measures are being taken in several areas, such as strengthening the fight against corruption, particularly at the level of public administration. As guarantors of good governance, the security and justice sectors are also being strengthened. Despite the impact of COVID-19 on our country\u2019s resources, respect for the rule of law and the advancement of a responsible democracy are providing us with the momentum to hold senatorial elections in December 2020 as senators\u2019 terms will end in January 2021.\nEconomic development and social progress remains our country\u2019s the number- one priority, as only shared prosperity can beneficially effect the social welfare of our people and ensure a better future for our children.\nToday, the international community stands together with us as a partner in our many initiatives to meet the important development challenges facing Madagascar. I take this opportunity to thank our partners for their full commitment to Madagascar and its people.\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the limits of multilateralism in terms of cooperation in the area of public health, which, as I mentioned earlier, must be imperatively rectified in a number of various and important spheres so that achieving the goals of the 2030 Agenda is not entirely jeopardized by the pandemic\u2019s effects. In the light of our shared challenges, Madagascar calls for a new universal multilateral initiative through the adoption of a post-COVID-19 global agenda under the auspices of the United Nations.\nSuch an initiative, which could have a specific timeline, would be geared towards better delegating and coordinating all our multilateral commitments and actions to counter the major socioeconomic risks posed by the current health crisis, particularly on the most vulnerable economies.\nSuch an approach, which we hope will be more focused and dynamic, will enable us together to regain confidence in ourselves and breathe new life into the ideals of solidarity and multilateralism that bring us together within the Organization.\nToday more than ever, it is the responsibility of every Member State of the Organization to adhere to the ideals of the Charter on which the UN was founded and strengthen its standing as the ideal framework for international cooperation to resolve major global problems, such as COVID-19. That is the basic condition necessary for successfully building the United Nations that we need in order to achieve the future we all want.\nI wish every success to the work of the seventy-fifth session, and thank you for your attention."

        "file_text": "Honoured President of the General Assembly,\nSecretary General Guterres,\nDear Members of the UN family,\nMy Brothers and sisters,\nFrench author Albert Camus has written: \u201cThere have been as many plagues in the world as there have been wars, yet plagues and wars always find people equally unprepared.\u201d\nLast year we all gathered in New York for the traditional UN General Assembly that now seems to be in a distant past and the occasion itself to belong to a world that doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\nThe pandemic that gave a thorough shock on our way of life also taught us a lesson. A lesson about what does climate change mean in reality \u2014 loss of diversified ecosystems, risks of the co-habitation of people and all other species in crowded towns. Bitter worry about the survival of the humankind and constant hard work in multilateral organisations to make sure we avoid global fights over limited resources.\nA lesson about the need to avoid restricting human rights and freedoms for the survival of the fittest.\nA lesson about the importance of technology and digital solutions, both to avoid health related risks and to stop unnecessary pollution of our planet.\nA lesson about fair burden sharing in fighting the climate change, fair access to technology to promote more equal opportunities for people globally, fair and transparent means to control that technology is not used to harm our societies.\nEstonia is the world\u2019s first digitally transformed state, where all public services run online. Disruption by pandemic was limited to upscaling e education and distant working. We saw less scramble than any other country to move everything online which previously ran on paper.\nHigh penetration rates of digital technologies in society, equal access to digital services promoted by both public and private sector over various age groups and different societal groups combined with strong, legally protected digital ID has helped a lot.\nWe want the same for the rest of the world.\nWe want equal opportunities for people globally to work from distance wherever they are. We want equal opportunities for people with special needs and homebound women to be able to work through digital means, intermittently as their schedule allows. We want global free labour market, which does not necessitate people to migrate, but stay where they want.\n30 per cent of jobs in Estonia are doable from distance. Estonia, as a late industrialiser, serves as a role model for countries looking to leapfrog with the help of technologies.\nWe are contributing to development of e-services globally, notably in Africa through digital memorandum between Estonia and African Union. This year we will also organise a Global Digital Business Summit together with the United Arab Emirates. Our small and medium sized enterprises are building e-services to other nations, cooperating with local partners to achieve tailor-made solutions and increase resilience of the digital ecosystems. Because we know \u2014 every digital state will preserve its identity and culture also online.\nThis is an advantage, but also a catch. Leaders globally must understand that digital services do not by themselves rid any country from fat bureaucracy, corruption or inefficiency. By digitalising these problems we can only make things worse, unless we simultaneously rise transparency and straighten out our processes. Thus digitalisation can make our states more efficient and bring closer to our people.\nDigital technologies also serve the fight against climate change. Smart grids, matching power supply and demand, developing digital solutions for that, is big part of C02 neutral economy to come. Green energy production is intermittent. We must balance this by not only developing reserve capacities like pump storage or hydrogen, but also to even out peak demands by smart consumption management.\nIn a way the pandemic and its aftermath gives us an opportunity for a great global technological leap. Digital solutions can make our societies more equal, more resilient, more accessible and sustainable.\nBut digital development comes also with its vulnerabilities and risks that is associated with cyber security. As an elected member of the UN Security Council since January this year we have kept our campaign promise to bring it to the formal table of the Security Council. Which we did already in March and continued in May. Because Estonia has the habit of keeping its word.\nDear colleagues,\nAs we tackle the global pandemic, conventional and unconventional threats have not disappeared. The world around us is as unpredictable and unsecure as it was before. Take the ongoing wars in Ukraine and Syria. Or the conflict in Sahel and the recent devastating disaster in Lebanon. As well as the grave human rights violations in Belarus.\nOverall, the pandemic has even reinforced some of the consequences of conflicts, for example the health and well-being of the most vulnerable \u2014 the children, women and adolescents. The pandemic has been used as a pretext to lift sanctions or restrict humanitarian aid. New divisions have emerged. This, my friends, is unacceptable.\nMy dear UN family,\nWe are 75 this year. The UN is and remains the cornerstone of our multilateral world order. There is no alternative to it. It is the best possible forum to address global issues from peace and security to new emerging threats. It\u2019s a forum where everybody has a voice.\nFrom here in Estonia, I can promise you that we shall continue standing for multilateralism and international law, imperfect as it feels for those impatient to resolve the crisis\u2019 of our world.\nThere is no better option than the UN, and we remain responsible and active partner to all other UN members during this crisis and beyond."

        "file_text": "Mr. Secretary-General, Mr. President, members of this honourable Assembly:\nArgentina was one of the founding States of the United Nations 75 years ago. Today, we are experiencing a health crisis of planetary dimensions that invites us to a new beginning.\nPope Francis calls on all of us, especially the leaders gathered on this occasion, to think about how to emerge better and not worse from this crisis.\nInspired by his preaching and his example, I come to ratify a call on the whole world to recreate a multilateralism based on our solidarity.\nThis is a time not to globalize indifference but to globalize solidarity in multiple dimensions.\nThis pandemic has revealed us to be fragile and has recreated the need to build bridges between people, between nations and between regions.\nIf we are able to manufacture artificial respirators by combining components and knowledge from different regions of the planet, we have to be able to dream and build \u201cnon-artificial respirators\u201d for the time of the post-pandemic.\nIf we are pooling the efforts of doctors, researchers, investors and scientific systems from around the planet to discover a vaccine that prevents COVID-19, we have to be able to dream and build a vaccine against social injustice, environmental predation and discrimination in all its forms.\nThis spirit of solidarity is what my Government has prioritized since its arrival and because of the pandemic and poverty, no one is safe, until everyone is safe.\nThat is why, from the start of the pandemic, Argentina focused primarily on protecting lives and caring for the most vulnerable, while implementing a series of emergency measures that prevented the collapse of the health system and mitigated the immediate impact of the pandemic.\nImmediate relief was provided to families and businesses through multiple measures, by a State that is present and active.\nIn the same spirit of solidarity, we argue that the vaccine produced to prevent the disease must be a global public good, accessible to all nations in an equitable manner.\nWe support the resolutions adopted to that end by the General Assembly and have made our capacities available for vaccine research and production.\nI set a goal for the Government to put Argentina back on its feet. Together, we can put the world back on its feet.\nThis requires us to recognize the importance of balance.\nBalance is restoring the priorities of the multilateral system, starting with those at the bottom and reaching everyone.\nWe must be architects of a new common house.\nBefore the pandemic, we raised the issue of the need to reform the United Nations Security Council. There are agreements to revitalize the World Trade Organization. We raised the issue of the crisis of the Bretton Woods Institutions, which had demonstrated shortcomings in responding to the 2008-2009 financial crisis. They are all part of the multilateral post-war architecture.\nThe pandemic also put traditional metrics in crisis with regard to determining access to development resources. Indicators commonly used to classify the needs of countries, such as per capita income, do not account for the diverse inequalities and specificities that exist within the same country.\nThe work of millions of domestic workers and unpaid caregivers, the majority of them women, has been made invisible.\nIt is also essential to consider how we conduct cooperation, while adopting a multidimensional approach that goes beyond per capita income to determine the eligibility criteria for official development assistance (ODA). More than 60 per cent of the poor live in middle-income countries. If we do not serve these countries, demonstrate solidarity and understand that real progress is built when everyone is involved, we will make very little steady progress in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.\nAll the aforementioned indicates that it is essential to revitalize the United Nations to enable it to respond to the mandate for which it was created.\nWe need a United Nations 4.0, with its foundational values intact and with the vision to incorporate the immense technological changes under way, to make them more human, more democratic and more socially inclusive.\nThis all points to the need for deep reflection, which goes above and beyond a response to the pandemic.\nOvercoming the pandemic and achieving the Goals of the 2030 Agenda requires economic, industrial and social policies aimed at bringing about structural change in our economies.\nCommitment to the environmental agenda requires the provision of considerable financial resources, capacity-building and technology transfer by developed countries, based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.\nOur country is committed to a fair transition towards comprehensive and sustainable development. A fair transition entails a gradual approach, strengthening the productivity and competitiveness of the economy and job creation.\nWe firmly believe that a collective commitment is needed to achieve the swift and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement.\nNo one is safe on a planet that is on fire, flooded or poisoned.\nIn this turbulent global environment, assuming toxic and irresponsible external debt for speculative purposes means another wave of delays and underdevelopment.\nArgentina managed to seal a major deal with almost all of its private external creditors, becoming one of the first countries to meet the challenge of debt restructuring during the pandemic.\nThe support of the international community, which includes several of the countries represented here, the private sector, civil society and the international academic community, has been key to restoring public debt sustainability.\nNegotiations with the IMF will be addressed in a similarly responsible manner, by respecting commitments and not jeopardizing the conditions that enable economic recovery and the construction of a path to inclusive and sustainable development.\nJust over 5 years ago, on 10 September 2015, the General Assembly adopted resolution 69/319, entitled \u201cBasic Principles on Sovereign Debt Restructuring Processes\u201d.\nThe position of the General Assembly on the matter set a precedent for governing international finance and recognizing sovereign economic rights in the face of abusive and extortionist behaviour.\nIt is all with the aim of ensuring that debt restructuring processes are reasonable and predictable, based on good faith, transparency, fair treatment, sovereign immunity from jurisdiction and execution, legitimacy, sustainability and majority restructuring.\nWe urge the international community to continue to seek new multilateral approaches to facilitate orderly debt restructuring and ensure increased access to public policy, while addressing the pandemic and sustaining inclusive growth.\nNo country can service its debt while its people are left without health, education, safety or the capacity to grow.\nThere is also balance in prioritizing human rights over everything else.\nThe promotion and protection of human rights has been a core policy of the Argentine State since 1983. This decision has resulted in the ratification and granting of constitutional status to all existing international human rights instruments, as well as our active participation at the regional and international levels.\nMemory, truth and justice guide the institutions of our democracy, as well as our respect for diversity and inclusion.\nThe post-pandemic world can exacerbate the severe refugee and displaced persons crisis facing the planet and our region. The answer should be the promotion and guarantee of the human rights of migrants.\nAs never before, our human condition demands solidarity from us. We cannot remain passive in the face of sanctions that include economic blockades that serve only to oppress people amid this humanitarian crisis.\nThe fight against all forms of discrimination and the consequent commitment to the rights of the vulnerable and persons and groups who have suffered long-term discrimination is part of Argentine State policy and is included in the many initiatives that Argentina supports and leads.\nThe global crisis caused by COVID-19 has also highlighted severe gender inequality.\nFor our society, achieving substantive equality between men and women is a priority and central pillar of Argentine democracy.\nMy Government is committed to the issue and that is why, for the first time in history, we have created the Ministry of Women, Genders and Diversity, as well as a National Cabinet, to ensure that gender policies are cross-cutting.\nOur Government decided to strengthen national actions and mechanisms for the care of women victims of violence, in addition to implementing a gender approach to social and labour protection measures and promoting co-responsibility and a fairer distribution of unpaid domestic work.\nThat commitment is already evident. Argentina was recognized by the United Nations in its ranking as the country that implemented the highest number of measures with a gender perspective during the pandemic.\nI\twish to reaffirm that Argentina condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and is in favour of addressing it within the framework of multilateral forums and always in accordance with the rule of law and respect for human rights.\nTwenty-six years after the bombing of the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association headquarters, I wish to maintain the policy initiated in 2003 and continued thereafter. I call on the authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran to cooperate with the Argentine judicial authorities in order to make progress in the investigation on that attack.\nWe also ask the international community to comply with the requests contained in INTERPOL Red Notices in the event of the presence of an accused person in its territories \u2014 something Argentina has never ceased to demand.\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm the legitimate and imprescriptible sovereignty rights of the Argentine Republic over the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia Islands and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas, which are an integral part of Argentina\u2019s national territory but have been illegally occupied by the United Kingdom for over 187 years.\nThis year will mark the fifty-fifth anniversary of resolution 2065 (XX), the first adopted by the Organization on the question of the Malvinas Islands, which called on Argentina and the United Kingdom to hold negotiations in order to reach a peaceful and definitive solution to that sovereignty dispute.\nThat request has remained in force and has been renewed on multiple occasions, most recently with the adoption by consensus of a new resolution on the matter by the Special Committee on Decolonization on 5 August.\nThe United Kingdom persists in its attitude by ignoring calls to resume negotiations on the territorial dispute and has aggravated the dispute by calling for the illegal and unilateral exploitation of renewable and non-renewable natural resources in the area, which runs counter to General Assembly resolution 31/49.\nThe United Kingdom also insists on an unjustified and excessive military presence in the Islands, which brings only tension to a region characterized by peace and international cooperation.\nWe have asked the Secretary-General to renew his efforts in the mission of good offices entrusted to him by the Organization. We are confident that the mission will be of great assistance to us in fulfilling the requirements of the international community.\nI wish to bid farewell to this honourable Assembly by urging all of us to seize this historic opportunity to unite as a society to address an unprecedented crisis.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has taken the lives of more than one million people and its painful aftermath is marked by increased poverty, hunger and inequality, which are putting us all to the test once again.\nI hope that solidarity, dialogue and cooperation between nations, as we were once able to achieve, will continue to be the way to respond to the challenges facing humankind.\nThank you very much."

        "file_text": "Respected President of the General Assembly,\nOn behalf of more than 1.3 billion people of India, I would like to congratulate every member state on the 75th anniversary of the United Nations.\nIndia is proud of the fact that it is one of the Founding Members of the United Nations.\nOn this historic occasion, I have come to this global platform to share the sentiments of 1.3 billion people of India.\nYour Excellency,\nThe world of 1945 was significantly different from today\u2019s world.\nThe global situation, sources-resources, problems-solutions; all were quite different.\nAnd as a result, the form and the composition of the United Nations, established with the aim of global welfare, were in accordance with the prevailing situation of those times.\nToday we are in a completely different era.\nIn the 21st Century, the requirements and challenges of our present as well as our future are vastly different from those of the past.\nTherefore, the international community today is faced with a very important question: Whether the character of the institution, constituted in the prevailing circumstances of 1945, is relevant even today?\nWith the changing times, if we don\u2019t change, then the drive needed to bring change will also get weakened.\nIf we were to make an objective assesment of the performance of the United Nations over the last 75 years, we see several stellar achievements.\nBut at the same time, there are also several instances that point to the need for a serious introspection of the work of the United Nations.\nOne could say that we have successfully avoided a third World War. But we cannot deny that there have been several wars, and many more civil wars.\nSeveral terrorist attacks shook the world and rivers of blood have continued to flow by.\nIn these wars and in these attacks, the people who died, they are people just like you and me.\nHundreds and thousands of children, who would have otherwise enriched this world with their presence, have left us prematurely.\nSo many people have lost their entire life savings and have become homeless refugees.\nDuring those times and even today, can we suggest that efforts of the United Nations to tackle these issues were sufficient.\nOver the last 8 to 9 months, the whole world has been battling the pandemic of the Coronavirus.\nWhere is the United Nations in this joint fight against the pandemic? Where is its effective response?\nYour Excellency,\nReform in the responses, in the processes, and in the very character of the United Nations is the need of the hour.\nIt is a fact that the faith and respect that the United Nations enjoys among the 1.3 billion people in India is unparalleled.\nBut it is also true that the people of India have been waiting for a long time for the process for the reforms of the United Nations to get completed.\nToday, people of India are concerned whether this reform-process will ever reach its logical conclusion.\nFor how long will India be kept out of the decision-making structures of the United Nations?\nThis is a country, which is the largest democracy of the world; This is a country with more than 18 per cent of the world population;\nThis is a country, which has hundreds of languages, hundreds of dialects, many sects, and many ideologies;\nThis is a country, which was a leading global economy for centuries and also one which has endured hundreds of years of foreign rule.\nExcellency,\nWhen we were strong, we were never a threat to the world, when we were weak, we never become a burden on the world.\nYour Excellency,\nHow long would a country have to wait particularly when the transformational changes happening in that country affect a large part of the world?\nYour Excellency,\nThe ideals on which the United Nations was founded and India\u2019s own fundamental philosophy has a lot of commonality. They are not different from each other.\nWithin the halls of the United Nations, one has often heard the words \u201cthe world is one family\u201d.\nWe treat the whole world as one family.\nIt is part of our culture, character and thinking.\nIn the United Nations too, India has always given priority to the welfare of the whole world.\nIndia is the country, which sent its brave soldiers to about 50 peacekeeping missions the world over to keep peace.\nIndia is that country, which in the course of maintaining peace, has lost the maximum number of its brave soldiers\nToday every Indian, while seeing the contribution of India in the United Nations, aspires for India\u2019s expanded role in the United Nations.\nExcellency,\nOn 2 October, India initiated the \u2018International Day of Non-Violence\u2019 and on 21 June India initiated \u2018International Day of Yoga\u2019.\nThe initiatives for the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure and the International Solar Alliance are realities today due to efforts of India.\nIndia has always thought about the interests of the whole humankind and not about its own vested interests.\nThis philosophy has always been the driving force of India\u2019s policies.\nFrom India\u2019s Neighbourhood First Policy to our Act East Policy, as well as the idea of Security and Growth for All in the Region, or our views towards the Indo Pacifc region, we have always worked for the interests of humankind and not driven by our own self-interests.\nIndia\u2019s partnerships are always guided by this very principle.\nAny gesture of friendship by India towards one country is not directed against any third country.\nWhen India strengthens its development partnership, it is not with any malafide intent of making the partner country dependent or hapless.\nWe have never hesitated from sharing experiences of our development. Your Excellency,\nEven during these very difficult times of the raging pandemic, the pharmaceutical industry of India has sent essential medicines to more than 150 countries.\nAs the largest vaccine producing country of the world, I want to give one more assurance to the global community today.\nIndia\u2019s vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used to help all humanity in fighting this crisis.\nIn India and in our neighbourhood, we are moving ahead with phase 3 clinical trials in India.\nIndia will also help all the countries in enhancing their cold chain and storage capacities for the delivery of the Vaccines.\nYour Excellency,\nStarting from January next year, India will also fulfil its responsibility as a non-permanent member of the Security Council.\nI express my gratitude to all fellow members states who have bestowed this trust upon India.\nAs the world\u2019s largest democracy we will bring our years of rich developmental experience for the benefit of the whole world.\nOur way forward is to proceed from human welfare to the welfare of the World.\nIndia will always speak in support of peace, security and prosperity.\nIndia will not hesitate in raising its voice against the enemies of humanity, human race and human values \u2014 these include terrorism, smuggling of illegal weapons, drugs and money-laundering.\nIndia\u2019s cultural heritage, tradition, thousands of years of experience will always stand in good stead for the developing countries.\nIndia\u2019s experiences, and India\u2019s developmental journey marked with its ups and downs will only add to strengthening the path to global welfare.\nYour Excellency,\nFollowing the mantra of Reform-Perform-Transform, India has made great efforts to bring about transformation in the lives of millions of its citizens.\nThese experiences are as useful for many countries of the world as they have been for us.\nIn just about 4-5 years, India has brought over 400 million people into the formal financial sector. This was not an easy task.\nBut India has proved that it can be done.\nIn just about 4-5 years, 600 million people have been freed from open defecation. This was not an easy task.jsIpjBut India has achieved it.\nWithin just about 2-3 years, more than 500 million people have been provided access to free health care services. This again was not an easy task.\nBut India was able to do this.\nToday, India is one of the leaders in Digital Transactions.\nToday, India is providing Digital Access to its millions of citizens, and in the process ensuring empowerment and transparency.\nToday, we have also launched an ambitious campaign for a Tuberculosis free India by 2025.\nToday, India is implementing a programme for providing piped drinking water to 150 million rural households.\nJust a few days ago India has initiated a huge project for connecting its 600,000 villages with broadband optical fibre.\nYour Excellency,\nIn the changed circumstances of the post-pandemic era, we are moving forward with the vision of a \u201cSelf-reliant India\u201d.\nA Self-reliant India will also be a Force Multiplier for the Global Economy.\nToday, it is also being ensured that there is no discrimination in extending the benefits of all the schemes and initiatives to every citizen of the country.\nLarge scale efforts are being made in India to promote Women Entrepreneurship and Leadership.\nIndian women, today, are the biggest beneficiaries of the largest Micro Financing Scheme of the world.\nIndia is one of those countries where women are provided Paid Maternity Leave of 26 weeks.\nIn India, the rights of transgenders are also being secured through necessary legal reforms.\nYour Excellency,\nIn its journey towards progress, India wants to learn from the world as well as share its own experiences with the world.\nI am confident that on the occasion of its 75th anniversary, the United Nations and its member countries will endeavour with a strong commitment to maintain the relevance of this great institution.\nStability in the United Nations and empowerment of the United Nations are essential for the welfare of the world.\nOn the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, let us once again pledge to dedicate ourselves for the welfare of the world.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "Excellencies,\nWe are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the United Nations in the midst of a global pandemic \u2014 a pandemic that has placed enormous pressure on our societies, our communities and our families. I would like to express my deepest condolences for the lives lost.\nTimes like these test the resilience of our societies and our international cooperation. More than ever, we need to work together in solidarity.\nIn this spirit, Sweden and Qatar co-chaired the negotiations on the \u201cDeclaration on the commemoration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations\u201d, which was adopted on 21 September. Member States sent a strong message of support for a rules-based international order and for multilateralism. We all re-committed to strengthening international cooperation, with a modern, innovative and inclusive UN at the core.\nWe now have the rare opportunity to build better societies \u2014 societies that are more resilient. We have the opportunity to jointly address shared challenges:\n-\tthe pandemic,\n-\tthe climate crisis,\n-\twidening inequalities,\n-\tviolations of international law\n-\tand threats to international peace.\nTo create, as Secretary-General Guterres called for in his recent Mandela Lecture, a new social contract and a new global deal.\nExcellencies,\nSweden fully supports the UN\u2019s leadership of the global COVID-19 response and recognises the crucial role of the World Health Organization.\nSo far, Sweden has contributed more than $170 million to the global response. Together with a number of world leaders, I have expressed my commitment to securing equitable and global access to future COVID-19 vaccines. No one is safe until everyone is safe. Securing access to vaccines is a global challenge that requires international cooperation and solidarity.\nExcellencies,\nClimate change is one of our most pressing issues. Throughout the world, young and old people alike have marched together on the streets to demand that decisionmakers like us act in line with scientific recommendations. We must reshape our societies and lower emissions. Sweden is striving to be the first fossil-free welfare nation but welcome all competition to beat us to the post.\n62/91\n21-00394\n13/01/2021\nA/75/592/Add.8\nWe will continue to work with the industrial sector to achieve net-zero emissions, not least within the \u201cLeadership Group for Industry Transition\u201d that we launched with India at last year\u2019s Climate Summit. We call for more ambitious nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement. We will work for an ambitious outcome at COP26 in Glasgow.\nExcellencies,\nAs we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, we need to strengthen our resolve to ensure that no one is left behind. Ensuring the equal participation of every individual, irrespective of their gender and sexual orientation, is essential to realising the 2030 Agenda.\nThe current pandemic is exacerbating existing discrimination and inequality and the risk of sexual and gender-based violence. It is having a disproportionate impact on women\u2019s and girls\u2019 access to essential health services. Robust funding of sexual and reproductive health and rights must be a priority.\nThe 25th anniversary of the landmark \u201cBeijing Declaration\u201d and Platform for Action\u201d offers an opportunity to intensify our efforts for gender equality. Sweden is ready to take on a leading role in UN Women\u2019s \u201cGlobal Action Coalition on Economic Justice and Rights\u201d. I am delighted to see that others have joined Sweden in pursuing a feminist foreign policy.\nExcellencies,\nThe pandemic is placing enormous pressure on the ability of democratic institutions to function and is having serious consequences for human rights. Far too many leaders and governments are using it as a pretext in their attempts to silence opposition, civil society and human rights defenders.\nSweden will continue to promote our Drive for Democracy, which aims to strengthen respect for democratic principles and institutions, civil society and international law. We support the Secretary-General\u2019s \u201cCall to Action for Human Rights\u201d.\nExcellencies,\nMillions of people around the world have lost their jobs and livelihoods because of the pandemic. Social dialogue in the workplace can help mitigate the impact of the pandemic and shape solutions. We need a sustainable transition in the global labour market, an issue I worked very closely on with President of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, when we co-edited the ILO report on the Future of Work. Sweden invites more countries to join the Global Deal partnership for Decent Work and Inclusive Growth.\nWe have also seen trade barriers introduced during the pandemic. Free, fair and sustainable trade is key in order to create new jobs and increase prosperity. The World Trade Organization has an essential role in upholding a rules-based international trading system.\nAround the world, record numbers of people need humanitarian aid to survive. The protracted conflict in Yemen has resulted in the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis. I urge donors to step up their support of the humanitarian response. We support UN peace efforts and urge the parties to immediately agree on a ceasefire,\n21-00394\n63/91\nA/75/592/Add.8\n13/01/2021\ninclusive political talks and continued implementation of the Stockholm and Riyadh agreements.\nWe extend our solidarity and support to the Lebanese people following the devasting explosion in Beirut.\nExcellencies,\nThe pandemic is a threat to international peace and security. Sweden and the EU strongly support the implementation of the Secretary-General\u2019s call for a global ceasefire. The UN Security Council has an enormous responsibility. To succeed in its mandated task of up-holding international peace and security, it must be reformed to effectively address current and future challenges.\nThe fight against impunity for international crimes remains essential. Sweden is steadfast in its support of the International Criminal Court.\nWomen\u2019s influence \u2014 in peace processes, political transitions and crisis recovery \u2014 is crucial. This year marks the 20th anniversary of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000); it must be a year of concrete action.\nSweden remains an active partner to the United Nations through:\n-\tfinancial core support,\n-\tdiplomacy,\n-\tmediation\n-\tand as a contributor of military and police personnel to UN peace operations, including MINUSMA. We are following developments in Mali with great concern. A peaceful, swift transition to civilian leadership, with democratic elections, is vital.\nRussia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol and aggression in eastern Ukraine constitute serious breaches of international law, challenge global security and cause human suffering. The European Union is clear on the need for the implementation of the Minsk agreements. Sweden and the European Union condemn in the strongest possible terms the poisoning of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The Russian government must investigate the assassination attempt thoroughly and transparently. Those responsible must be brought to justice.\nWe support, as the only viable means of solving the conflict between Israel and Palestine, a negotiated solution with two states living in peace and security. It must be based on internationally agreed parameters and an end to the occupation. The EU position is clear: annexation of occupied territory is illegal.\nIn Syria, sustainable peace can only be achieved through a political solution in line with resolution 2254 (2015). Sweden recently pledged 96 million dollars to the crisis response at the Brussels 4 Conference.\nWhile there are plenty of challenges across the globe, there is also hope. The Sudan now has a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Women and young people took to the streets in 2019, demanding political change, and courageous political decisions followed. The Sudan deserves our support on its difficult path to democracy.\nExcellencies,\nNext year, Sweden will assume the role of Chair of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Our main priority will be working for conflict resolution that builds on the OSCE comprehensive concept of security, with democracy and human rights at the core. The European security order must be upheld, not renegotiated.\nSweden is alarmed at the situation in Belarus following the elections on 9 August, which were neither free nor fair. The increased repression of peaceful demonstrators, journalists and opposition leaders is unacceptable. We stand in solidarity with the Belarusian people in their desire to exercise their fundamental democratic rights. We continue to call on the Belarusian leadership to stop the repression and engage in genuine dialogue with the op-position. We stand ready to facilitate such dialogue.\nExcellencies,\nThis year also marks the 75th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It serves as a tragic reminder of the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of the use of nuclear weapons. The nuclear threat is as present as ever. Milestone treaties have been abandoned or are at risk, and new nuclear capabilities are being developed. We call on the United States and Russia to agree on an extension of the \u201cNew START Treaty\u201d, and on China to join discussions on follow- on arrangements.\nAs part of our multilateral disarmament diplomacy, Sweden \u2014 together with 15 non-nuclear-weapon states \u2014 continues to pursue the Stockholm Initiative on Nuclear Disarmament, which aims to contribute to a successful NPT Review Conference.\nTogether with the EU, we strongly support the full implementation of the \u201cJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action\u201d.\nWe call on the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to adhere to its international obligations and take steps towards denuclearisation.\nWe remain committed to a peaceful resolution of the situation on the Korean Peninsula.\nExcellencies,\nFuture generations will grow up in a different world. We now have the opportunity to shape its direction.\nTogether with other countries, Sweden will mobilise support for the Secretary-General in advancing our common agenda laid out in the seventy fifth anniversary Declaration.\n-\tTogether, we can build better societies.\n-\tTogether, we can build stronger societies.\nAnd, together, we can address the challenges that lie ahead. Thank you."

        "file_text": "In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful,\nMr President,\nMr Secretary General,\nYour Excellencies:\nThese are indeed extraordinary times in our history and in the history of the United Nations, when we find ourselves meeting virtually for the first time in the UN\u2019s 75 years, as our world continues to grapple with COVID-19 and its far-reaching implications, and as our peoples look towards us to navigate these uncharted waters, with bold statesmanship.\nIt is incredible how a virus that infected a single person in one corner of the globe, has grown and expanded to hit the very foundations of our international system, our global economy, all of humanity.\nIt would be equally incredible if the lesson of just how interconnected we really are, is lost on us. We cannot beat this virus by turning inwards. It does not stop at borders, and nor should our cooperation.\nWe can only overcome COVID-19, and what comes beyond it, through a renewed integration of our world, a re-globalisation that makes the wellbeing of all our peoples the ultimate goal; a re-globalisation that capitalises on each country\u2019s potential, its strengths, and resources, with regional safety nets keeping the flow of vital supplies open; a re-globalisation that better equips us for a post-COVID-19 world.\nMy friends,\nAmong the multiple challenges that our world will have to face is hunger, at a substantially larger scale than previous decades. Indeed, it has already begun to creep up on us. We see threats to food security in Lebanon. We see hunger threatening vulnerable refugee communities in our region. We see it threatening communities living in poverty across the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and elsewhere.\nPreparing for this is a key priority for Jordan, and we also stand ready to do what we can for our region and our friends, by channelling our capabilities to operate as a regional hub for food security.\nAnd it is out of our belief in the importance of maintaining food security for generations to come, that we are also strongly committed to safeguarding the main source of humanity\u2019s subsistence\u2014our environment.\nRecognising that protecting our natural environment would ultimately protect all existence, Jordan has drafted a charter, to be submitted to the UNGA, that grants selected ecosystems and all species of flora and fauna the legal right to exist. And thus ensuring humanity itself continues to exist. This initiative would be in line with the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals, which contribute to safeguarding our environment for the prosperity of our world.\nMy friends,\nThe COVID-19 crisis has brought a mirror to our world, and shown us the cracks in our global system. In so doing, it has offered us what could be a historic moment to rethink the role of the United Nations and other multilateral organisations, to become more impactful in dealing with challenges, old and new\u2014be they pandemics, or raging conflicts.\nAs long as injustice and lack of peace persist, anywhere in the world, the UN must not rest; we must not rest.\nThe Palestinian-Israeli conflict is the one conflict that started with the UN\u2019s formation and that continues to fester to this very day. The only way towards an end to this conflict, the central conflict in my region, is through the two-state solution, in accordance with international law and UN resolutions.\nThe only way towards just and lasting peace must lead to an independent, sovereign, and viable Palestinian state, on the June 4th, 1967 lines, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living side-by-side with Israel, in mutual peace and security.\nAnd we cannot resolve this conflict without working to preserve Jerusalem for all humanity, as a unifying city of peace. As Hashemite Custodian, I am bound by a special duty to safeguard Jerusalem\u2019s Islamic and Christian holy sites, but the responsibility for the Holy City falls on us all.\nMy friends,\nJordan joined the United Nations a decade after its founding. Ever since, we have embraced our role as an active member state, working towards global peace and sustainable development.\nIn the 75th anniversary of this important body, we remain deeply committed to its promise in building a more prosperous, inclusive, and peaceful world, and we see in these extraordinary times an opportunity to help fulfil that promise.\nLet us use this opportunity to be bolder in our ambitions. Bolder in our actions. And bolder, in believing in our ability to succeed.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "Your Excellency, Mr. Volkan Bozkir, I congratulate you on Turkey\u2019s election to preside over this historic 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. I pledge Barbados\u2019 full support during your presidency. We are confident that the work of the General Assembly will be facilitated, Mr. President, by your steadfast dedication and competent leadership.\nI also wish to express my appreciation to your predecessor, H.E. Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande of Nigeria, for his excellent stewardship of the 74th Session, and his wise guidance in adapting the Secretariat and Member States to the world of virtual diplomacy to advance the Organization\u2019s work in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAt this critical juncture in its history, Mr. President, when the United Nations should be celebrating its 75th Anniversary, the world is consumed by many complex challenges. Challenges that arise from a world in crisis, and a world with no global leadership.\nA world that appears to have lost its moral compass.\nGlobally, we are witnessing an increased focus on systemic racial injustices, economic and social inequities, transnational crime, terrorism, human trafficking, increased human displacement, rising autocracies, violence against women and the climate crisis, to name but a few.\nGeopolitical tensions are increasing as some countries, displaying an alarming preference for unilateral action, are dominating and marginalising others. Multilateralism, one of the philosophical underpinnings on which this very organisation was founded in 1945, is under serious threat.\nPower imbalances are causing the world to lose its equilibrium.\nNotwithstanding, Barbados continues to hold in highest regard the fundamental precepts of international community and collective action.\nThe imbalance of which I spoke earlier Mr. President is also evident when you look at how some States are being treated with respect to their debt management.\nThe refusal of those who have it in their power to help revive our economies \u2014 whether it be by moratoria or refinancing, or even access to concessional loans and grants \u2014 is causing us greater economic hardship.\nSmall island developing states, many of which are in the Caribbean and Pacific, labour under onerous debt burdens. Our African brothers share a similar fate. Sadly, for many of us, this remains our post-Independence legacy.\nWhen Barbados joined the United Nations, it was our intention to be craftsmen of our fate and plan trajectories for our post-colonial development. Instead, we now find ourselves ensnared in the false per capita-based construct of so-called \u201cmiddle income countries\u201d. An assessment which bears little resemblance to our everyday existence. An assessment which prohibits our access to concessional loans or financing in adequate amounts, thereby stymieing our development.\nIs not now the time for debt forgiveness? Is it not now the time for the creation of innovative economic instruments to reverse the widening gap of inequality?\nAnother instance of one-sidedness is in the global financial system where organisations of limited membership engage in universal \u201cblacklisting\u201d, and correspondent banking relationships are unilaterally withdrawn. Our small countries are blacklisted for daring to exert their sovereign right to create their own taxation systems and are forced to compete under rules that we have had no voice in setting.\nThis arbitrariness in engagement with countries like Barbados must cease. It is done without out knowledge and involvement. It is contrary to the laws of natural justice. These combined factors are pushing our countries back into a state of postcolonial penury.\nMr, President, nothing more starkly exemplifies this imbalance of power like climate change. Severe weather events are occurring across the globe and are making our climate mitigation and adaptation efforts even more urgent. As small island developing states, we are struggling to stay afloat literally and figuratively. Just think about what is happening to The Maldives.\nIn Barbados we have lost over 60 per cent of our coral reefs along with the rich abundance and diversity of species that the reef ecosystems support. In response, my government has launched an ambitious programme called Roofs to Reefs to save the remaining reefs and hopefully use modern exciting new technologies and the creation of new marine protected areas to rehabilitate damaged reefs.\nWhat is ironic is that some countries represented here today provide advice on how Small Island Developing States can increase their resilience, and then take decisions in other areas that can significantly undermine those efforts. It is no secret that the greatest contributors to the climate crisis do not bear the consequences proportionally, and consequently they are not incentivized to decrease their greenhouse gas emissions.\nBarbados, for its part, is not postponing its climate ambition. We will not be deterred! Barbados will be fossil-fuel free by 2030.\nThe United Nations must take greater steps to strengthen and revitalize the climate agenda. The challenges of sustainable development and creating resilience to climate change will assume even greater importance for our deliberations and negotiations. The UN will, of necessity, have to thread the needle carefully on these issues, some of which are of an existential nature for our countries.\nI take this opportunity to express Barbados\u2019 appreciation to the host of COP- 26, the United Kingdom, for doubling its contribution to the Green Climate Fund to \u00a31.44 billion. We are of the view that the need for adequate climate finance in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be overstated.\nMr. President, yet another reality that confronts us now is that once again the world is on the brink of devastation, This time at the hands of a pervasive new enemy, the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThis novel coronavirus has stripped us bare!\nIt has manifested into a \u201cperfect storm\u201d that has undoubtedly derailed what limited progress we were positioning ourselves to make in implementing the 2030 Agenda, and has jeopardised our ability to meet the Sustainable Development Goals within the agreed timeframe. Above all, it has exacted a horrific toll on millions of families worldwide and has already taken close to a million lives.\nThat is why, Mr. President, Barbados unequivocally supports the Secretary- General\u2019s call in his recently issued Policy Brief on Debt and COVID-19 that the international financial institutions, the multilateral development banks and the UN should provide debt relief. Equally, we support the calls by ECLAC for the use of a vulnerability index through which issues of debt can be addressed and access to capital determined.\nWe also eagerly look forward to the results of the upcoming High-Level Event on Financing for Sustainable Development in the COVID-19 Era and Beyond where Member States will be presented with to address areas ranging from Illicit Financial Flows to Sustainable Recovery and the crushing debt burden faced by Small Island Developing States.\nWe are resolute in our view that debt relief and support measures, or additional financing, cannot be bound to any conditionality.\nBarbados is also supportive of the UN\u2019s Economic Commission for Africa in its call for the creation of a special purpose lending vehicle, the Liquidity and Sustainability Facility, to support African, American and Caribbean countries in advancing sustainable development initiatives and, more immediately, facilitating access to liquidity, lending and investment. In terms of the current COVID-19 crisis, such a facility could significantly lower borrowing costs, support financial sustainability, and help countries access markets for needed bridge financing and liability management.\nMr. President, Barbados\u2019 recovery from the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will be slow and painful. Resuscitating our economy has been a balancing act between reopening for tourism-related services and air travel, and ensuring that our population remains safe. Given the importance of the global tourism industry, we are of the firm view that workers in these sectors should be prioritised among those frontline workers earmarked to receive approved vaccinations. This would put hundreds of millions of people back to work and stimulate the largest global economic driver,\nBarbados and the Caribbean community owe a great debt of gratitude to Director General Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus and the World Health Organization for their support and solidarity in ensuring our access to stocks of tests and equipment needed to combat COVID-19. Barbados is also grateful for the assistance received from many other countries, allies, partners and agencies around the world which enabled us to manage and control the spread of the virus.\nThe United Nations must continue to play a key role in the global response to the pandemic to help its Members in their recovery and to assist them to build back better and greener \u2014 better economies, better societies, better conditions for the upliftment of the poor and marginalized,\nPermit me, Mr. President, to mention of a few other issues of key importance to Barbados.\nIt is widely recognised that chronic non-communicable diseases are a global problem and constitute the largest cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. We therefore call on the United through its Inter-Agency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of NCDs, and on the World Health Organisation, to develop a health strategy aimed at treating these NCDs as part of a comprehensive development plan. I take this opportunity to point out the nexus between NCDs as both predisposing and exacerbating factors for COVID-19. This linkage makes the management of the NCDs all the more critical.\nMr. President, Barbados calls once again for an end to the Economic and Trade Embargo imposed on Cuba, our sister Caribbean nation. Deep bonds of friendship and family link our two countries, and I wish to place on record Barbados\u2019 deep gratitude to the Government and people of Cuba for their invaluable assistance rendered through the provision of much-needed healthcare workers to help us respond to COVID-19.\nWith respect to Venezuela, Barbados continues to call for sustainable, legitimate and peaceful stability in this important regional partner. In this regard, we look forward to the holding of inclusive elections.\nI am pleased to advise, Mr. President, that from April 25th to 30th 2021, Barbados will be the first Small Island Developing State to host the UNCTAD quadrennial meeting. We eagerly await the opportunity to welcome the world to our shores.\nThe UNCTAD 15 theme From Inequality and Vulnerability to Prosperity for All will facilitate the discussion of a wide range of issues, including the impact of COVID-19 not just on trade and development, but also on our ability to attain the SDGs and Agenda 2030. We will also focus on the future of the multilateral trading system, the measurement of vulnerability, the management of debt, and the structural transformation of developing countries.\nMr. President, let me emphasize that Barbados is clear in its conviction that after seventy-five years the United Nations remains the pre-eminent organisation to respond to the global challenges before us, and to support the international community in the task of rebuilding our societies and economies in an inclusive and sustainable manner.\nHowever, the organization must become nimble and focus more on people, more on delivery and less on bureaucracy. Barbados fully supports Secretary- General Guterres in his repeated calls for a New Global Deal. This New Global Deal must make the United Nations relevant not only to its founding members, but also to countries like Barbados which joined the organisation well after.\nMr. President, now is the time for leaders to foster unity and solidarity. Now is the time for us to display global moral leadership to promote international cooperation and collective action.\nI am obliged to you."

        "file_text": "Never in the history of our species \u2014 not since the almighty felled the tower of babel \u2014 has the human race been so obsessed with one single topic of conversation. We have been following the same debates, researching the potential of the same drugs, and time and again we have been typing the same word into our search engines. COVID-19, coronavirus, has united humanity as never before.\nAnd yet the crisis has also been an extraordinary force for division. We have all been up against the same enemy. The same tiny opponent threatening everyone in much the same way, but members of the UN have still waged 193 separate campaigns, as if every country somehow contains a different species of human being. Across the world there has been an infinite variety of curfews and restrictions and closures, and we have fought in a spirit of sauve qui peut.\nAnd the pace has been so urgent and the pressures so intense that each national government \u2014 democracy or otherwise \u2014 has decided entirely understandably to put the interests of its domestic population first. We have seen borders spring up between friends and allies, sometimes without consultation. We have seen the disruption of global supply chains with cheque book wars on airport tarmacs as nation has vied with nation for a supply of PPE.\nAnd after nine months of fighting COVID-19, the very notion of the international community looks, frankly, pretty tattered. And we know that we simply can\u2019t continue in this way.\nUnless we get our act together. Unless we unite and turn our fire against our common foe, we know that everyone will lose. The inevitable outcome would be to prolong this calamity and increase the risk of another.\nNow is the time \u2014 therefore, here at what I devoutly hope will be the first and last ever Zoom UNGA \u2014 for humanity to reach across borders and repair these ugly rifts.\nLet\u2019s heal the world \u2014 literally and metaphorically. And let\u2019s begin with the truth, because as someone once said, the truth shall set you free.\nAnd with nearly a million people dead, with colossal economic suffering already inflicted and more to come, there is a moral imperative for humanity to be honest and to reach a joint understanding of how the pandemic began, and how it was able to spread \u2014 Not because I want to blame any country or government, or to score points. I simply believe \u2014 as a former COVID patient \u2014 that we all have a right to know, so that we can collectively do our best to prevent a recurrence.\nAnd so the UK supports the efforts of the World Health Organisation and of my friend, Tedros, to explore the aetiology of the disease, because however great the need for reform, the WHO, the World Health Organization, is still the one body that marshals humanity against the legions of disease. That is why we in the UK \u2014 global Britain \u2014 are one of the biggest global funders of that organisation, contributing \u00a3340 million over the next four years, that\u2019s an increase of 30 percent.\nAnd as we now send our medical detectives to interview the witnesses and the suspects \u2014 bats, the pangolins, whoever \u2014 we should have enough humility to acknowledge that alarm bells were ringing before this calamity struck.\nIn the last 20 years, there have been eight outbreaks of a lethal virus, any of which could have escalated into a pandemic. Bill Gates sounded the alert in 2015, five years ago he gave that amazing prediction \u2014 almost every word of which has come true \u2014 and we responded as if to a persistent Microsoft error message by clicking \u201cok\u201d and carrying on.\nHumanity was caught napping. We have been scrabbling to catch up, and with agonising slowness we are making progress\nEpidemiologists at Oxford University identified the first treatment for COVID-19. They did trials with our national health service and found that a cheap medicine called dexamethasone reduces the risk of death by over a third for patients on ventilators. The UK immediately shared this discovery with the world, so that as many as 1.4 million lives could be saved in the next six months by this one, single advance.\nAnd as I speak there are 100 potential vaccines that are trying to clear the hurdles of safety and efficacy, as if in a giant global steeplechase. We don\u2019t know which may be successful. We do not know if any of them will be successful.\nThe Oxford vaccine is now in stage 3 of clinical trials, and in case of success AstraZeneca has already begun to manufacture millions of doses, in readiness for rapid distribution, and they have reached agreement with the Serum Institute of India to supply one billion doses to low and middle-income countries.\nBut it would be futile to treat the quest for a vaccine as a contest for narrow national advantage and immoral to seek a head start through obtaining research by underhand means. The health of every country depends on the whole world having access to a safe and effective vaccine, wherever a breakthrough might occur; and, the UK, we will do everything in our power to bring this about.\nWe are already the biggest single donor to the efforts of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness to find a vaccine. And it is precisely because we know that no-one is safe until everyone is safe, that I can announce that the UK will contribute up to \u00a3571 million to COVAX, a new initiative designed to distribute a COVID-19 vaccine across the world. Of this sum, \u00a3500 million will be for developing countries to protect themselves.\nThe UK is already the biggest donor to Gavi, the global vaccine alliance. In June we helped to raise almost $9 billion to immunise another 300 million children against killer diseases, and Gavi also stands ready to help distribute a COVID-19 vaccine.\nBut even as we strive for a vaccine, we must never cut corners, slim down the trials or sacrifice safety to speed. Because it would be an absolute tragedy if in our eagerness, we were to boost the nutjobs \u2014 the anti vaxxers, dangerous obsessives who campaign against the whole concept of vaccination and who would risk further millions of lives.\nAnd now is the time above all to look ahead and think now about how to stop a pandemic from happening again. How can we stop another virus from coming along and again smashing that precious Ming vase of international cooperation? How can we avoid the mutual quarantines and the brutal Balkanisation of the world economy?\nI don\u2019t think there is any reason for fatalism: of course, the dangers can never be wholly eliminated, but human ingenuity and expertise can reduce the risk. Imagine how much suffering might have been avoided if we had already identified the pathogen that became COVID-19 while it was still confined to animals?\nSuppose we had been able to reach immediately into a global medicine chest and take out a treatment? What if countries had been ready to join together from the outset to develop and trial a vaccine? And think how much strife would have been prevented if the necessary protocols \u2014 covering quarantine and data-sharing and PPE and so much else \u2014 had, so far as possible, been ready on the shelf for humanity to use?\nSo we in the UK we\u2019re going to work with our friends, we\u2019re going to use our G7 presidency next year to create a new global approach to health security based on a five point plan to protect humanity against another pandemic.\nOur first aim should be to stop a new disease before it starts. About 60 percent of the pathogens circulating in the human population originated in animals and leapt from one species to the other in a \u201czoonotic\u201d transmission. The world could seek to minimise the danger by forging a global network of zoonotic research hubs, charged with spotting dangerous animal pathogens that may cross the species barrier and infect human beings.\nThe UK is ready to harness its scientific expertise and cooperate to the fullest extent with our global partners to this end. Of the billions of pathogens, the great mass are thankfully incapable of vaulting the species barrier. Once we discover the dangerous ones, our scientists could get to work on identifying their weaknesses and refining anti-viral treatments before they strike.\nWe could open the research to every country and as we learn more, our scientists might begin to assemble an armoury of therapies \u2014 a global pharmacopoiea \u2014 ready to make the treatment for the next COVID-19.\nOur second step should be to develop the manufacturing capacity for treatments and vaccines So that the whole of humanity can hold them like missiles in silos ready to zap the alien organisms before they can attack. But if that fails and a new disease jumps from animals to human beings and overcomes our armoury of therapies and begins to spread, then we need to know what\u2019s going on as fast as possible.\nSo the third objective should be to design a global pandemic early warning system, based on a vast expansion of our ability to collect and analyse samples and distribute the findings, using health data-sharing agreements covering every country. As far as possible, we should aim to predict a pandemic almost as we forecast the weather to see the thunderstorm in the cloud no bigger than a man\u2019s hand.\nAnd if all our defences are breached, and we face another crisis, we should at least be able to rely on our fourth step, and have all the protocols ready for an emergency response, covering every relevant issue, along with the ability to devise new ones swiftly.\nNever again must we wage 193 different campaigns against the same enemy. As with all crises, it is crucial not to learn the wrong lessons. After the harrowing struggle to equip ourselves with enough ventilators \u2014 with countries scrabbling to improvise like the marooned astronauts of Apollo 13 \u2014 there is a global movement to onshore manufacturing. That is understandable.\nHere in the UK we found ourselves unable to make gloves, aprons, enzymes which an extraordinary position for a country that was once the workshop of the world. We need to rediscover that latent gift and instinct, but it would be insane to ignore the insights of Adam Smith and David Ricardo.\nWe need secure supply chains \u2014 but we should still rely on the laws of comparative advantage and the invisible hand of the market. Many countries imposed export controls at the outset of the pandemic, about two thirds of which remain in force. Governments still target their trade barriers on exactly what we most need to combat the virus, with tariffs on disinfectant often exceeding 10 per cent, and for soap tariffs for 30 per cent.\nSo I would urge every country to take a fifth step and lift the export controls wherever possible \u2014 and agree not to revive them \u2014 and cancel any tariffs on the vital tools of our struggle: gloves, protective equipment, thermometers and other COVID-critical products. The UK will do this as soon as our new independent tariff regime comes into effect on 1st January and I hope others will do the same.\nThough the world is still in the throes of this pandemic, all these steps are possible if we have the will. They are the right way forward for the world, and Britain is the right country to give that lead. And we will do so in 2021, as we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of this great United Nations in London in January, and through our G7 Presidency, and as we host the world\u2019s climate change summit, COP26, in Glasgow next November.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been an immense psychic shock to the human race. Global fears have been intensified by the immediacy of round the clock news and social media. We sometimes forget, we face a virus \u2014 a small package of nucleic acid that simply replicates. It is not even technically alive.\nTragic as its consequences have been, it has been nothing like as destructive as other plagues \u2014 let alone the influenza of a century ago. It is absurd, in many ways, outrageous that this microscopic enemy should have routed the unity of the human race.\nCOVID-19 has caused us to cease other vital work, and I\u2019m afraid it made individual nations seem selfish and divided from each other. Every day people were openly encouraged to study a grisly reverse Olympic league table, and to take morbid and totally mistaken comfort in the greater sufferings of others.\nWe cannot go on like that, we cannot make these mistakes again. And here in the UK, the birthplace of Edward Jenner who pioneered the world\u2019s first vaccine We are determined to do everything in our power to work with our friends across the UN, to heal those divisions and to heal the world."

        "file_text": "MR. PRESIDENT,\nMR. SECRETARY-GENERAL,\nDEAR COLLEAGUES,\nIt is my honour and privilege to address the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly.\nMr. President,\nPlease accept my congratulations on your election. I wish you every success during the seventy-fifth UN General Assembly session.\nThe coronavirus overwhelmed the agenda of all institutions throughout the world. Yet, the theme of this virtual meeting suggests to us something more. Seventy- five years since its inception, the United Nations is in debt to humanity.\nWe are witnessing a shrinking space of freedom and violations of human rights and international law. Multilateralism as a key UN approach to a collective and solidarity-based solution to global and regional problems was put to the test.\nIn these circumstances, the world needs the UN more than ever as the moral leader of the modern world. I believe that the UN mission, drawn up 75 years ago, is capable of surviving the crisis of the organization itself \u2014 just as the UN had to revive the ideas born of the League of Nations and save future generations from the scourge of war.\nThe UN is going through a structural crisis that requires reform and revitalization. The UN General Assembly in its 75th anniversary presents a good opportunity to intensify work on the Security Council reform. Bulgaria supports the start of negotiations at the intergovernmental level in this direction.\nIn early 2020, the UN Secretary-General outlined four threats to humanity:\n\u00a5\tgeopolitical tensions and devastating conflicts;\n\u00a5\tthe climate crisis;\n\u00a5\tgrowing global mistrust, and\n\u00a5\tthe dark side of the digital world.\nShortly afterward, the new threat of COVID-19 multiplied the risk of a global catastrophe.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has threatened the rule-based international order.\nThe false opposition of \u201chealth or economy\u201d has emerged. Protectionism has caused disruptions in supply chains. Asymmetric socio-economic changes have exacerbated inequality and the danger of destabilization and conflict.\nThe \u201cInfodemic\u201d \u2014 the wave of true and false information, which overwhelmed people, has further heightened their concerns.\nOn 25 March this year, The UN Secretary-General, the UN Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, the UNICEF Executive Director, and the World Health Organization Director-General announced a COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan. Practically the entire UN system was committed to the humanitarian plan.\nThe UN has been proving once again to be a leader in exploring the needs, fundraising, management, delivery, and distribution of humanitarian aid to the population in countries in conflict or crisis.\nBulgaria welcomes the adoption of Security Council Resolution 2532 (2020) and the Secretary-General\u2019s Call for a Global Ceasefire to protect the most vulnerable population groups.\nAlong with the UN, we will continue to support all working mechanisms, including the World Health Organization and the World Trade Organization. These institutions should contribute to a global, multilateral, and coordinated response to address the immediate and long-term effects of COVID-19, as well as to address future global crises.\nThe European Union and other regional organizations have joined the UN initiative for a global response to the pandemic, building on the mechanism of multilateralism. The strategic response of the European Union is multilateralism, combined with competitive and sustainable economies and solidarity.\nThe statements of the Alliance for Multilateralism, which Bulgaria joined on 26 September 2019, are in line with the four directions for UN action announced by the Secretary-General \u2014 cybersecurity, climate, security, and the fight against lethal autonomous weapons systems.\nOur country took an active part in the Alliance\u2019s meeting on strengthening the multilateral health architecture. In this manner, we reaffirmed our commitment to supporting multilateral cooperation in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMr. President,\nThis year, Bulgaria has marked the 65th anniversary of its accession to the World Organization. As a member of the United Nations and the European Union, we are ready to take on our responsibilities:\n\u00a5\tSupporting the leading role of the UN in multilateral cooperation to tackle the global pandemic;\n\u00a5\tActively working to implement the European Union\u2019s priorities and actions in response to the pandemic, participating at the same time in initiatives for a global response to this challenge;\n\u00a5\tAs an important participant and mediator in the integration processes in Southeast Europe;\n\u00a5\tContributing to peacekeeping operations and ensuring unhindered access\nto humanitarian assistance;\n\u00a5\tAs a constructive member of the Human Rights Council for 2019-2021;\n\u00a5\tAnd an active member of the ECOSOC for the period 2021-2023;\n\u00a5\tImplementing the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the\nParis Agreement.\nBulgaria has joined the Team Europe package as part of the European Union measures to support third countries in tackling the pandemic. We promptly restructured our national program for development and humanitarian aid. Just over one million euros have been earmarked for emergency humanitarian aid, health care, and support for socio-economic development.\nThe goal was to support the most vulnerable groups among our neighbours in the Western Balkans, the Eastern Partnership countries, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan, and through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees.\nBulgaria has provided humanitarian assistance in kind and a financial contribution to UNICEF\u2019s activities in support of the children who suffered in the tragedy in Lebanon.\nTo recover from the negative effects of the pandemic in the Western Balkans, it is particularly important to use the established cooperation mechanisms effectively: the Berlin Process \u2014 which Bulgaria is co-chairing with the Republic of North Macedonia this year, the South-East European Cooperation Process, the Regional Cooperation Council, and the Central European Free Trade Agreement. Our efforts are aimed at improving connectivity and security in the region.\nThe development of good-neighbourly relations in the Western Balkans with the neighbouring European Union Member States is particularly important in this context.\nWe reaffirmed our support for the Secretary-General\u2019s Initiative on Action for Peacekeeping. UN peacekeeping operations are the epitome of multilateralism and international solidarity. Not coincidentally, the first such operation was the deployment of a limited contingent of Blue Helmets in the Middle East to monitor the ceasefire between Israel and its Arab neighbours.\nBulgaria supports the leading role of the UN in the efforts to resolve the conflicts in the region of the Middle East and North Africa.\nWe welcome the US-sponsored agreement to normalize relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, and between Israel and Bahrain. This is a major diplomatic breakthrough that could open a new page in the history of the Middle East and change the lives of its peoples.\nSuspending the plans for unilateral annexation of the Occupied Palestinian Territories prevents a humanitarian catastrophe in the context of an ongoing pandemic. It is also a step towards avoiding serious violations of human rights and international law.\nWe welcome and support the efforts of the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Nikolay Mladenov.\nThe civil conflict in Syria remains a serious destabilizing factor. A political transition in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2254 (2015) and the 2012 Geneva Communique is the single way to overcome the crisis and alleviate the situation of the civilians in need. I would also like to voice my country\u2019s support for the African Union\u2019s efforts to maintain peace and security on the continent in a situation complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA cause for serious concern for my country is the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, where the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate. Bulgaria reaffirms its support for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity in accordance with UN General Assembly Resolution 68/262 of 2014. Bulgaria was among the cosponsors of this resolution. We support the efforts within the Normandy format to achieve progress in implementing the Minsk agreements.\nDuring the first donor campaign in May this year, Bulgaria, through the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, redirected to Ukraine \u20ac100,000 from development and cooperation funds, as well as a package of humanitarian aid in kind to combat COVID-19.\nWe are following the situation in Belarus with concern. Bulgaria stands behind the rights and demands of the Belarusian people for a democratic future and free and fair elections. The efforts of the international community should be aimed at supporting and assisting the holding of inclusive national dialogue on a peaceful resolution of the crisis.\nLast but not least, Bulgaria, within NATO, is developing transatlantic cooperation and solidarity in the conditions of the pandemic. The strategic dialogue between Bulgaria and the United States, which began in January this year, also covers the practical dimensions of overcoming the consequences of the pandemic.\nWithin the framework of the global network \u201cResponsibility to Protect\u201d of the UN member states, Bulgaria supported the need for shared responsibility for the prevention of atrocities during the COVID-19 pandemic. We recall the appeal of the World Health Organization for the responsibility of each country to protect the health and safety of its citizens in times of a crisis.\nMr. President,\nThe global pandemic is also a threat to the timely implementation of the UN Agenda 2030. Bulgaria, together with the other European Union member states, is fully committed to the implementation of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals during the Decade of Action.\nGetting through the current crisis does not mean returning to our old way of life. We need to step on a new paradigm by implementing long-term economic measures. The full implementation of the Agenda 2030, the Paris Agreement and the Addis Ababa Action Plan are critical to preparing the world for future systemic shocks.\nThe UN has no alternative in terms of the development of international law and multilateral cooperation. As a member state of the European Union, Bulgaria will champion a strong United Nations Organization as its main partner as a solid foundation of the rules-based multilateral order.\nIn conclusion, I would like to refer to the appeals of two Nobel Peace Prize winners in 1994. In order to achieve the common goals, which have brought us together at this forum, we should use our imagination more than our memory. We need to leap beyond our own imagination to prevent the olive branch from falling out of our hands .\nTHANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT"

        "file_text": "His Excellency Mr. President, His Excellency the Secretary-General,\nExcellencies Heads of State and Government, Ladies and gentlemen,\nOn behalf of my people and my country, allow me to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Volkan Bozkir on his honourable and distinguished role as President of the United Nations General Assembly at its seventy-fifth session.\nYour Excellency\u2019s election to this highly representative body of the international system shows the confidence that your country, Turkey, a friend of Guinea-Bissau, and all Member States of our Organization have placed in you. We express our most ardent wishes for the success of this noble office.\nI assure you of the fullest cooperation of my country, Guinea-Bissau, during the deliberations of the session under your leadership.\nHis Excellency Mr. President, Excellencies,\nFirst of all, I would like to extend my deepest condolences to the Member States of the Organization following the loss of life among their populations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic currently wreaking havoc around the world.\nI would like to thank health professionals throughout the world, in particular those from my country and those from all international organizations now present in Guinea-Bissau, who, together and on a daily basis, alongside our authorities, are on the front lines helping to control the spread of COVID-19 and save the lives of those infected.\nThe agenda of the Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly in Response to the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic is of particular importance. We must all cooperate with the scientific community in its efforts to find solutions and support the most vulnerable so as to address the immediate negative impacts of COVID-19, by helping to strengthen health systems and develop and equitably distribute treatments and vaccines.\nThe challenges encountered daily in various parts of the world \u2014 as remote as they may appear in the globalized world in which we live today \u2014 should remind us that they could end up being common problems.\nThe pandemic has underscored that truth and taught us the importance of uniting our efforts to combat COVID-19 and all other scourges and challenges we face on our planet.\nThat is why, this year, as we celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, we must work together to restore to the United Nations the values and ideals for which it was created. To build the United Nations that we want and truly need to guide and combat the global adversities of today\u2019s world, the time has come to reiterate our commitments and strengthen multilateralism. Only in this way will we be able to move forward with the humanitarian agenda, while considering vulnerabilities, promoting gender equality and finally achieving the 2030 Agenda that guarantees everyone\u2019s well-being.\nHis Excellency Mr. President, Excellencies,\nI am honoured to address this great Assembly today, 24 September \u2014 the day when my country, Guinea-Bissau, marks another year of its existence as a free and independent nation. Our independence was achieved with great honour and sacrifice. I congratulate my people.\nDuring these 46 years of our history, our country has experienced challenging times in its quest for a path to stability and sustainable development that would ensure the well-being of its sons and daughters. The support of the international community, in particular the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations, has been essential to ending for good the conflicts that have plagued our country. I deeply thank the Secretary-General of the United Nations, His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, and all the friends and partners of Guinea-Bissau for their assistance throughout this period.\nHowever, as we approach the end of the mandate of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNIOGBIS), and as we assume, through national efforts, primary responsibility for stabilizing our country, with the normalization of the functioning of all State institutions under way, the continued and indubitable assistance of the international community, through its cooperation and coordination with the authorities of the country, is crucial for us to conclude the necessary reforms and continue along our path to development.\nIn this regard, I would like to take the opportunity offered by this noble forum to reaffirm to my people that, under my presidency, I will do my best to turn this tragic page of crises and conflicts in our history. I will work hand in hand with all Guineans to meet the challenge of rebuilding a new Guinea-Bissau \u2014 one well aware of our problems, but with collective national strength within the country and the diaspora alike, in order to move forward together and guarantee a better future for the next generations.\nThe year 2020 has been a year of challenges for the world without exception, but it is proving more difficult for the most vulnerable countries, such as Guinea- Bissau. It is an extremely vulnerable country as it is a post-conflict African country, a least developed country (LDC) and a small island developing State (SIDS), facing considerable threats from climate change.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has compounded already existing vulnerabilities, thereby exacerbating the socioeconomic problems of the country and the lives of our peoples.\nIn the light of the volatile supply chain and commodity prices that have had a negative impact on international trade, Guinea-Bissau, a country dependent on agriculture and its waters, has not been spared. The cashew campaign for its main export product has been severely affected and that will have an adverse effect on the economy and well-being of its people. Negative growth is influencing poverty trends in many countries like ours and putting at risk those who were already without social protection.\nClimate change is irrefutable. Although it already affects small island developing States, including Guinea-Bissau, it is a danger to us all because it is a threat to the existence of our planet.\nThe Government has developed national strategies and sectoral policies with international partners to address these challenges. It has also implemented medium- and long-term climate change adaptation plans. It has made available more than 26 per cent of its territory to the National System of Land and Marine Protected Areas, among several other initiatives, such as its contributions to the mitigation of greenhouse gases and NDCs.\nMr. President, Excellencies,\nGender equality is a crucial issue for Guinea-Bissau. The participation of women is unequivocal in all spheres of our society. Since the struggle for independence \u2014 and this year marks another year of independence \u2014 women have always stood alongside men to take political and social decisions in the country. Guinean women are the drivers of positive change. They are the best mediators of conflicts, promoters of dialogue and peacemakers.\nOn our new path to recommit to multilateralism, women must have a place as one of the main driving forces.\nYoung people are another important group given that in many of our countries they account for the majority of the population. In Guinea-Bissau, we have the strength and support of this sector of society, which has actively participated in dialogue processes for peace and stability.\nWe count on our young people and call on our development partners to continue to assist us with instruments, such as qualified education and technologies, to better empower our youth. In this way, we assist not only in reducing the unemployment rate in our country, but also in ensuring a bright future for the next generation.\nWe cannot talk about multilateralism while allowing the economic and financial embargo to continue to be imposed on one of the most supportive members of our Organization \u2014 Cuba. Despite the negative impacts of this embargo, Cuba has been a leader in all global health challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Cuba remains on the front lines in providing assistance to the world.\nWe demand that the economic and financial embargo imposed on Cuba by the United States of America be lifted without delay. The Cuban people deserve the opportunity to make the most of its potential and freely seek economic relations with other States and peoples.\nWith regard to Palestine, we hope that the main actors in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process continue to be engaged in diplomatic negotiations in the quest for lasting peace and for the peaceful coexistence of the two States living in harmony, side by side and with mutual respect.\nMr. President, Excellencies,\nBefore concluding, I would like to reaffirm our country\u2019s commitment to working towards the United Nations we want and need. We expect strong commitment from our development partners in renewing multilateral commitments aimed at building a more just and brotherly world, while guaranteeing human security for the well-being and progress of all peoples and cultures.\nI cannot end my statement without thanking and aligning myself with the statements made by those who spoke on behalf of the G77 and China, the SIDS and the LDCs, of which my country is a member.\nI thank you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nColleagues,\nThis year marks the 75th anniversary of the victory in the World Anti- Fascist War and the founding of the United Nations (UN). Yesterday, the high-level meeting to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the UN was held. The meeting was a significant one, as it reaffirmed our abiding commitment to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter on the basis of reviewing the historical experience and lessons of the World Anti-Fascist War.\nMr. President,\nWe humans are battling COVID-19, a virus that has ravaged the world and has kept resurging. In this fight, we have witnessed the efforts of governments, dedication of medical workers, exploration of scientists, and perseverance of the public. People of different countries have come together. With courage, resolve and compassion which lit the dark hour, we have confronted the disaster head on. The virus will be defeated. Humanity will win this battle!\nFacing the virus, we should put people and life first. We should mobilize all resources to make a science-based and targeted response. No case should be missed and no patient should be left untreated. The spread of the virus must be contained.\nFacing the virus, we should enhance solidarity and get this through together. We should follow the guidance of science, give full play to the leading role of the World Health Organization, and launch a joint international response to beat this pandemic. Any attempt of politicizing the issue or stigmatization must be rejected.\nFacing the virus, we should adopt comprehensive and long-term control measures. We should reopen businesses and schools in an orderly way, so as to create jobs, boost the economy, and restore economic and social order and vitality. The major economies need to step up macro policy coordination. We should not only restart our own economies, but also contribute to global recovery.\nFacing the virus, we should show concern for and accommodate the need of developing countries, especially African countries. The international community needs to take timely and robust measures in such fields as debt relief and international assistance, ensure the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and help these countries overcome their difficulties.\nSeventy-five years ago, China made historic contributions to winning the World Anti-Fascist War and supported the founding of the United Nations. Today, with the same sense of responsibility, China is actively involved in the international fight against COVID-19, contributing its share to upholding global public health security. Going forward, we will continue to share our epidemic control practices as well as diagnostics and therapeutics with other countries, provide support and assistance to countries in need, ensure stable global anti-epidemic supply chains, and actively participate in the global research on tracing the source and transmission routes of the virus. At the moment, several COVID-19 vaccines developed by China are in Phase III clinical trials. When their development is completed and they are available for use, these vaccines will be made a global public good, and they will be provided to other developing countries on a priority basis. China will honor its commitment of providing US$2 billion of international assistance over two years, further international cooperation in such fields as agriculture, poverty reduction, education, women and children, and climate change, and support other countries in restoring economic and social development.\nMr. President,\nThe history of development of human society is a history of our struggles against all challenges and difficulties and our victories over them. At present, the world is battling the COVID-19 pandemic as it goes through profound changes never seen in a century. Yet, peace and development remain the underlying trend of the times, and people everywhere crave even more strongly for peace, development and win-win cooperation. COVID-19 will not be the last crisis to confront humanity, so we must join hands and be prepared to meet even more global challenges.\nFirst, COVID-19 reminds us that we are living in an interconnected global village with a common stake. All countries are closely connected and we share a common future. No country can gain from others\u2019 difficulties or maintain stability by taking advantage of others\u2019 troubles. To pursue a beggar-thy-neighbor policy or just watch from a safe distance when others are in danger will eventually land one in the same trouble faced by others. This is why we should embrace the vision of a community with a shared future in which everyone is bound together. We should reject attempts to build blocs to keep others out and oppose a zero-sum approach. We should see each other as members of the same big family, pursue win-win cooperation, and rise above ideological disputes and do not fall into the trap of \u201cclash of civilizations\u201d. More importantly, we should respect a country\u2019s independent choice of development path and model. The world is diverse in nature, and we should turn this diversity into a constant source of inspiration driving human advancement. This will ensure that human civilizations remain colorful and diversified.\nSecond, COVID-19 reminds us that economic globalization is an indisputable reality and a historical trend. Burying one\u2019s head in the sand like an ostrich in the face of economic globalization or trying to fight it with Don Quixote\u2019s lance goes against the trend of history. Let this be clear: The world will never return to isolation, and no one can sever the ties between countries. We should not dodge the challenges of economic globalization. Instead, we must face up to major issues such as the wealth gap and the development divide. We should strike a proper balance between the government and the market, fairness and efficiency, growth and income distribution, and technology and employment so as to ensure full and balanced development that delivers benefit to people from all countries, sectors and backgrounds in an equitable way. We should pursue open and inclusive development, remain committed to building an open world economy, and uphold the multilateral trading regime with the World Trade Organization as the cornerstone. We should say no to unilateralism and protectionism, and work to ensure the stable and smooth functioning of global industrial and supply chains.\nThird, COVID-19 reminds us that humankind should launch a green revolution and move faster to create a green way of development and life, preserve the environment and make Mother Earth a better place for all. Humankind can no longer afford to ignore the repeated warnings of Nature and go down the beaten path of extracting resources without investing in conservation, pursuing development at the expense of protection, and exploiting resources without restoration. The Paris Agreement on climate change charts the course for the world to transition to green and low-carbon development. It outlines the minimum steps to be taken to protect the Earth, our shared homeland, and all countries must take decisive steps to honor this Agreement. China will scale up its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions by adopting more vigorous policies and measures. We aim to have C02 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. We call on all countries to pursue innovative, coordinated, green and open development for all, seize the historic opportunities presented by the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, achieve a green recovery of the world economy in the post-COVID era and thus create a powerful force driving sustainable development.\nFourth, COVID-19 reminds us that the global governance system calls for reform and improvement. COVID-19 is a major test of the governance capacity of countries; it is also a test of the global governance system. We should stay true to multilateralism and safeguard the international system with the UN at its core. Global governance should be based on the principle of extensive consultation, joint cooperation and shared benefits so as to ensure that all countries enjoy equal rights and opportunities and follow the same rules. The global governance system should adapt itself to evolving global political and economic dynamics, meet global challenges and embrace the underlying trend of peace, development and win-win cooperation. It is natural for countries to have differences. What\u2019s important is to address them through dialogue and consultation. Countries may engage in competition, but such competition should be positive and healthy in nature. When in competition, countries should not breach the moral standard and should comply with international norms. In particular, major countries should act like major countries. They should provide more global public goods, take up their due responsibilities and live up to people\u2019s expectations.\nMr. President,\nSince the start of this year, we, the 1.4 billion Chinese, undaunted by the strike of COVID-19, and with the government and the people united as one, have made all- out efforts to control the virus and speedily restore life and economy to normalcy. We have every confidence to achieve our goals within the set time frame, that is, to finish the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, lift out of poverty all rural residents living below the current poverty line, and meet ten years ahead of schedule the poverty eradication target set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nChina is the largest developing country in the world, a country that is committed to peaceful, open, cooperative and common development. We will never seek hegemony, expansion, or sphere of influence. We have no intention to fight either a Cold War or a hot war with any country. We will continue to narrow differences and resolve disputes with others through dialogue and negotiation. We do not seek to develop only ourselves or engage in a zero-sum game. We will not pursue development behind closed doors. Rather, we aim to foster, over time, a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other. This will create more space for China\u2019s economic development and add impetus to global economic recovery and growth.\nChina will continue to work as a builder of global peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of international order. To support the UN in playing its central role in international affairs, I hereby announce the following steps to be taken by China.\nChina will provide another US$50 million to the UN COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan.\nChina will provide US$50 million to the China-FAO South-South Cooperation Trust Fund (Phase III).\nChina will extend the Peace and Development Trust Fund between the UN and China by five years after it expires in 2025.\nChina will set up a UN Global Geospatial Knowledge and Innovation Center and an International Research Center of Big Data for Sustainable Development Goals to facilitate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nMr. President,\nColleagues,\nThe baton of history has been passed to our generation, and we must make the right choice, a choice worthy of the people\u2019s trust and of our times. Let us join hands to uphold the values of peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom shared by all of us and build a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind. Together, we can make the world a better place for everyone."

        "file_text": "President of the General Assembly; Secretary-General; Heads of State and Government,\nFor many years, the General Assembly has discussed cooperation, dialogue, solidarity, the importance of progress in science and technology and ending poverty in the world.\nIt has also discussed the urgent need of strengthening the Organization and multilateralism.\nThe pandemic, which is affecting the planet, has made it hight time to turn those good intentions into more meaningful actions.\nCOVID-19 has put every pressure to bear on multilateralism. Six months after it began, we are dealing not only with a health emergency, but also a social and economic one.\nWithout exception, every country has been hit by the deadly virus.\nWe will not be able to save lives and revive the economy without the support of multilateral organizations, private enterprise, the academic community and society, as a whole.\nFor Ecuador, the support of international financial agencies has been key these past months.\nThat is why we commend the calls for a multilateral response to the crisis.\nThe Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund recognizes the importance of supporting emerging and developing economies, and the President of the World Bank is talking about a debt moratorium for poor countries.\nEcuador supports and appreciates those proposals and calls for middle-income countries to be taken into account, as every nation is facing serious economic problems.\nDear friends, COVID-19 has historically changed the world today and, in all probability, its future.\nPoverty, inequality and unemployment will worsen, which will have an impact on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. We risk backsliding with regard to the gains made over the past few years.\nEcuador\u2019s national development plan \u2014 Lifetime \u2014 which we have not been remiss in implementing, is aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nWe firmly believe in the need for a strong, solid and committed multilateral system that ensures financial and technical support to all.\nThe pandemic has shown that technology is key to guaranteeing citizens\u2019 rights, such as access to remote health care, education and work.\nBut it has also shown the great digital divide that exists among our nations, which is a product of inequality.\nThe post-COVID era will pose for us the challenge of reviving economies and focusing on small- and medium-sized businesses, which create thousands upon thousands of jobs.\nIt is necessary to offer flexible and sufficient lines of credit with acceptable terms, as well. But it is also imperative to meet the commitments of official development assistance.\nColleagues from around the world, my country underscores the work of the World Health Organization and its leadership during this crisis.\nThat is why we support the COVAX Facility initiative, to step up access to COVID-19 vaccines and the repository of technologies to combat the pandemic.\nOnly in this way will we be able to enjoy fairly distributed patent-free vaccines, with special attention afforded the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people.\nThe pandemic has affected us all, but its impact has been most severe on vulnerable groups.\nIn addition to COVID-19 itself, the lockdown, the lack of employment and poverty have exacerbated gender-based violence. Women and children have had to stay at home with their abusers, risking their physical and mental safety and sometimes even their lives!\nOlder adults and people with disabilities are also suffering disproportionately from the crisis because of their increased risk of infection.\nIn Ecuador we have provided welfare vouchers, mobility and self-care assistance and, in many cases, decent housing at no cost.\nTogether with 145 Member States we endorsed the policy brief, entitled \u201cA Disability-inclusive response to COVID-19\u201d.\nLikewise, we recognize the vulnerability of indigenous peoples. We must give them priority attention commensurate with their circumstances, and we must guarantee them access to treatments and vaccines.\nMigrants have also been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. As a host country, Ecuador seeks to guarantee the exercise of their rights with a humanitarian response.\nWe will continue to firmly support the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, as well as the full implementation of the Declaration of Quito on Human Mobility of Venezuelan Citizens in the Region.\nFellow Presidents, the sustainable use of natural resources and climate change is an issue that we cannot ignore.\nThe failure to implement environmental agreements has very serious economic and social repercussions.\nEcuador recently expressed its concern about the presence of a large foreign fishing fleet, which since May 2020 has been operating in very close proximity to the Galapagos Islands.\nWe have reiterated that, without distinction of the flag, we will ensure that our maritime rights prevail over the exclusive economic zone.\nWe are aware of the enormous responsibility to protect the Galapagos, which was designated as humankind\u2019s first Natural World Heritage site.\nWe call on the countries that fish in the waters of the south-east Pacific to self- regulate and limit their activities.\nWe, the members of the Permanent Commission for the South Pacific, namely, the brotherly countries of Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, condemn illegal fishing in areas adjacent to our countries\u2019 waters.\nWe have also agreed to strengthen sharing information on the location of vessels in order to improve monitoring and surveillance.\nEcuador therefore reaffirms its commitment to conserve the marine environment. As a demonstration of that, on 11 August, we joined the Global Ocean Alliance.\nThe initiative, led by the United Kingdom, seeks to designate 30 per cent of the world\u2019s oceans as marine protected areas.\nWe are also committed to the conservation of the Amazon.\nWe subscribe to the Leticia Declaration and what is known as the Financing Initiative for Sustainable Development and Bio-Economy for the Amazon.\nWith the establishment of the multi-donor fund, administered by the IDB, significant resources will be allocated to conserve what are the lungs of the planet and improve the quality of life of indigenous peoples.\nWe are facing new challenges the solution to which lies in unity and peace, not conflict.\nRecently, 172 countries supported the call of the Secretary-General for a global ceasefire and silencing all weapons.\nWe are confident that the call and the relevant Security Council resolution (Security Council resolution 2532 (2020)) will serve as a first step towards achieving definitive and sustainable peace throughout the world.\nToday, our obligation is to join our efforts and fight the pandemic.\nFor now, that is our common enemy!\nRecently, the commemoration of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki served to remind us of the devastating consequences of nuclear weapons. We therefore welcome the forthcoming entry into force of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\nThe pandemic must serve as an additional reason to step up disarmament obligations and make available the needed resources for revitalization.\nFriends and Heads of State and Government, I conclude by stressing that Ecuador firmly supports the initiative to move forward meaningful reform of the UN system.\nIt is necessary to ensure greater accountability and maximize its efficiency.\nIt is imperative to overhaul the system that we created at the end of the Second World War, as it does not reflect today\u2019s reality.\nIt is also important to guarantee the allocation of funds, to which end States must fulfil their obligation to contribute to the Organization without conditions or threats.\nToday, our peoples demand cooperation so we will be able to face the economic and social challenges of the post-COVID-19 era.\nOnly together will we be able to win this cruel war, a cruel war that has already taken the lives of nearly 1 million people.\nDear friends, I hope that, in the very near future, we will be able to give one another the fraternal hug that we owe another inside and outside our countries.\nThank you very much."

        "file_text": "Mr. President:\nCosta Rica congratulates you on your election as President of the General Assembly of the United Nations at its seventy-fifth session. We reiterate our commitment to working with you, the Secretary-General and all the Member States to achieve the objectives of this session, which is of an urgent nature today at what may be the turning point for all humankind and for the destiny of planet Earth.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought pain, death and unemployment in one way or another to the entire family of humankind.\nAnd as powerful as the COVID-19 pandemic is, having caused serious damage to health, economy, society, development and security, the virus appears to be just an early warning.\nIt is an early warning of what humankind must face in the immediate term and in the coming decades. We are still at the beginning of this path, which, as a planet, we must travel together and overcome.\nSolidarity and multilateralism take on greater meaning today. Altruism and supreme values must guide us, not only because they are correct, but because today altruistic and selfish interests alike come together in the understanding that there can be no individual or national welfare if there is no shared and global welfare.\nThis is true for combating COVID-19, addressing migration, fighting the illegal trafficking of people, weapons or drugs, fighting poverty, promoting development, human security and women\u2019s rights, and overcoming the threat of the climate crisis. We must ensure that even the most selfish understand this and that we all work as a team.\nSkin; hope; roots; tenderness; dinner; silence; bread; house; words \u2014 those are the words that the poet Jorge Debravo used to define us in our common and basic desires.\nBut in my statement, in such a privileged space, I do not want rhetoric to be what allows me to capture your attention. I want that as a result of the concrete proposals that Costa Rica and its partners are making to the Assembly, for which we are asking for your consideration, hard work and support.\nFrom the outset, Costa Rica has insisted that health is a global public good and that the World Health Organization (WHO) be called upon to lead the multilateral response to the pandemic. On 29 May, Costa Rica, the WHO and 40 other States launched a platform for the exchange of information, knowledge and intellectual property to make COVID-19 tests, treatments and technologies accessible to everyone, everywhere.\nFor Costa Rica, it is essential that the vaccines reach \u2014 first and foremost \u2014 those who are most vulnerable, such as the elderly, people with risk factors, women and girls, indigenous peoples and people of African descent, people deprived of their liberty and, of course, health workers and staff who are on the front lines of response throughout the world.\nParticipation in the proposed exchange platform is voluntary, hence I invite more States to join. From our side, we have added the equine plasma treatment developed by the Clodomiro Picado Institute of the University of Costa Rica to the platform. The treatment involves a novel development of antiviral plasma that fights the virus in the early stages of its development and seeks to prevent the patient requiring intensive care.\nA second proposal that Costa Rica is promoting is the Fund to Alleviate COVID-19 Economics, also known by the English acronym FACE. FACE would be an extraordinary support fund of half a trillion dollars, financed with 0.7 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the world\u2019s biggest and strongest economies \u2014 those that account for 80 per cent of global GDP \u2014 to be intermediated by one or several multilateral development banks as concessional loans to developing countries. The funds would be lent on a long-term basis and at fixed rates.\nThose figures are modest compared to the amounts that high-income economies have made available to deal with the internal consequences of COVID-19, whether by increasing monetary flows, fiscal deficits, support for domestic businesses and jobs or their own public debt.\nThat amount represents the equivalent of more than 3 per cent of the average GDP of emerging and poor economies like ours. Acting in a decisive, innovative and organized way is our only option to avoid the economic destabilization of our countries and the global financial system. Acting in a decisive, innovative and organized way is how we can fulfil our commitment leave no one behind.\nFACE serves to protect every country and the global community.\nLadies and gentlemen of the global community, if there is one thing we have learned from the pandemic, it is that we cannot talk about security without considering human security.\nNevertheless, global military spending continues to rise worldwide and reached the absurd sum of 1.9 trillion dollars in 2019, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI.\nThe rise in military spending in 2019 was the largest annual increase in the past decade and the highest level since the end of the Cold War. The International Peace Bureau estimates that the cost of one tank could treat 26,000 people for malaria and the cost of a single aircraft carrier could reforest an area larger than the state of Florida. That is equivalent in size to Switzerland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium combined.\nIf at least a fraction of all those resources were used to combat the pandemic, as well as the climate crisis, our generation could proudly say that we were able to redefine our priorities when the circumstances required it.\nThe permanent members of the Security Council, themselves the world\u2019s largest arms producers, should help redirect those priorities in line with Article 26 of the Charter of the United Nations. The Security Council should then also change its name, and become the Human Security Council.\nOur resources and our priorities must converge in the realization of the most ambitious and comprehensive human development programme ever conceived: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Those Goals are more relevant today than ever before. They provide us with a model for overcoming the crisis and prepare us for future ones. Fairer, more equitable and more sustainable societies will be more resilient to the inequalities that this terrible pandemic has revealed and magnified.\nToday, we must prioritize less armament; more resources for development; more resources to combat the pandemic; more resources to counter climate change; more resources for the SDGS; less militarization and less death. That represents true human security for all peoples.\nThe reform of our collective security architecture can no longer be deferred. The main body responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security must become more democratic, representative, accountable and transparent.\nWe need a Council that looks at the root causes of conflicts, not just their symptoms. We need a Human Security Council that creates incentives to shift the world\u2019s human and economic resources towards development and peace rather than towards the war industry. We need a Council capable of overcoming its deep internal divisions in order to work in unity, with a single voice.\nCosta Rica supports the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency Group Code of Conduct regarding Security Council action against genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes, and supports the convening of the General Assembly to consider the issue whenever a veto is issued in the Security Council.\nImpunity is unacceptable. A renewed commitment to multilateralism requires ensuring that those responsible for gross human rights violations and abuses are held accountable for their actions.\nCosta Rica reiterates its firm commitment to the principles and values enshrined in the Rome Statute and calls for its universal ratification, as well as to preserve the integrity and independence of the International Criminal Court. Of course, significant changes are required in the face of any unilateral sanctions against the Court\u2019s institutions or staff, as such acts are an affront to multilateralism.\nA renewed commitment to multilateralism requires respect for the Charter of the United Nations and international law without exception.\nA selective approach also weakens our collective security system. Such an approach has led the nuclear-weapon States to disregard or threaten to disregard their obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, while demanding that others comply. I invite all States that have not yet done so to sign and ratify that historic instrument.\nIn that regard, Costa Rica advocates for a Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons, with peace, stability and security. We therefore call upon the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea to respect and implement the relevant Security Council resolutions.\nCosta Rica calls for a just solution to the Palestinian question, for which the parties must resume peace talks. We are convinced that the conflict can be resolved only by the creation of two States, in line with the relevant Security Council resolutions, to coexist side by side in democracy, justice and peace. Furthermore, we welcome the peace agreements between Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.\nIn our America, we wish to draw attention to the economic blockade against Cuba, which is affecting its population. We reiterate that the situation must cease. We also believe that a peaceful, expeditious and democratic solution, under the auspices of the other States of the region, is needed to address the grave political and humanitarian situation in Venezuela and the violations of human rights that its people are experiencing.\nCosta Rica joins the concerns expressed by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms. Michelle Bachelet, in her recent report to the Human Rights Council on the situation in Nicaragua. We strongly urge the Government of this sister country to constructively address its internal tensions and structural problems and to orient its actions towards the well-being of its citizens. Ensuring respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms is the only path that leads to peace, inclusion and development.\nThe tragedy that Haiti is experiencing calls for joint action. Caravans of Haitian men, women and children are travelling across the Americas in search of better conditions, and it is high time that we worked together to help to resolve this grave humanitarian situation.\nMany violations of international law are committed every day through disinformation, cyberattacks, cybercrime and interference in electoral processes.\nIn that connection, Costa Rica welcomes the General Assembly resolutions calling on all Member States to heed the reports of the Group of Governmental Experts, which confirm the applicability of existing international law, including the Charter of the United Nations in its entirety, to that new area. However, the task of seeking greater guarantees for individuals and institutions in such matters must befall the international community.\nMr. President,\nIf COVID-19 is an early warning for humankind, the climate crisis and inequality are the greatest threats to human security for our generation and the next. We must embrace the complexity of our tasks, rather than shy away from them. Reason, empathy, science, fraternity and speaking the truth \u2014 however hard it may be \u2014 must triumph over simplistic, hateful or polarizing discourse which, in its simplicity and superficiality, hinders the progress required by action and dampens the human spirit.\nThose complex tasks involve ensuring the implementation of the most relevant sustainable development instrument, namely the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030. They also require the necessary fiscal space, debt relief measures, official development assistance and international cooperation to close the gap between development goals and the actions it calls for.\nWe cannot speak about sustainability without taking the necessary action for the effective protection of our oceans and their biodiversity. For that reason, Costa Rica is actively participating in the negotiations on the new agreement for the protection of biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction and the negotiations on mining code regulations within the framework of the International Seabed Authority. We are raising our voice so that no mining contract will be considered insofar as the effective protection and preservation of the marine environment cannot be guaranteed.\nTogether with France, we are also promoting the High Ambition Coalition to ensure that 30 per cent of the world\u2019s land and sea territories are protected by 2030, as a nature-based solution to the climate crisis.\nEvery pandemic that has affected humankind throughout its history has come and gone. The question is: how well will we tackle our pandemic, and how well will we emerge from it? We will overcome this crisis, but how do we envision our new beginning? We must build inclusive, sustainable, carbon-free economies that respect human rights.\nMr. President:\nCosta Rica renews its commitment to a multilateralism focused on the dignity of people, especially those who are most vulnerable. Our multilateralism must be agile and action-oriented. We firmly believe that international security, national security and human security are not separate concepts, but go hand in hand. Our multilateralism must be entrepreneurial and resilient, promoting inclusive, sustainable and carbon-free economies.\nAs we commemorate this anniversary, Costa Rica renews its commitment to the hope that allows us to continue our mission \u2014 even under the most adverse conditions. We hope that the United Nations will fulfil the duty it has undertaken to all humankind and contribute to fostering peace not through words, but through actions.\nMay the world end this chapter with the same words as this poet:\n\u201cI have returned to my country. That part of me, at least, that was far away, shrouded in the fog of not knowing, of not believing, has returned. Today I see those who fill the streets, the squares, the parks, in their everyday clothes; I see those who tie their shoes, early in the morning, as if they were attached to the weight of the world; in all of them, there is a light that is not just the reflection of the red taxis, or the sound of the newspaper hitting the door like a gunshot, or the flash of the ticket you show on the train which accounts for your payment only of the kilometres you\u2019re travelling that day.\nI see the light of another time.\nIt is ours.\u201d\nThank you very much."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nSecretary-General of the United Nations,\nHeads of Delegation,\nDistinguished delegates,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nMr. President,\nYour brilliant election to the presidency of the 75th session of the General Assembly gives me the pleasant opportunity to extend to you my sincere congratulations and those of my delegation.\nMr. outgoing President, Dear Professor Tijjani Muhammad Bande\nWhen you assumed the presidency of the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly on behalf of Africa, we had no idea that our Organization, and beyond that, the entire world, would experience a health crisis as profound as that of COVID-19.\nFaced with this unforeseeable situation, you and your team managed to adapt to the new requirements and meet the challenges before you in order to ensure the continuity of the activities and functioning of the General Assembly.\nSecretary-General,\nOn January 22, you presented your 2020 priorities to the General Assembly, identifying what you called the four \u201chorsemen of the apocalypse\u201d that are the global geostrategic tensions, the \u201cexistential\u201d climate crisis, the growing mistrust among people everywhere and the \u201cdark side\u201d of the digital world.\nUnfortunately, less than two months later, a fifth and highly destructive horseman of the apocalypse, the coronavirus disease, appeared and was added to the four already identified. Since then, you have been fully invested in ensuring that the United Nations is mobilized in confronting the pandemic and its multifaceted consequences.\nMr. President,\nHeads of Delegation,\nOn 14 June 2019, the United Nations General Assembly decided, through resolution 73/299, to celebrate the 75th anniversary of our common organization under the theme \u201cThe future we want, the UN we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism\u201d. But given the global crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the President of the General Assembly supplemented the celebration\u2019s general theme with the words \u201cto confront COVID-19 through effective multilateral action\u201d.\nThis theme, underpinning all of the activities, meetings and conferences organized by the UN in 2020, reminds us of the fundamental reasons behind our organization\u2019s creation.\nTo commemorate this anniversary, all of us would have liked to be physically present at Headquarters in New York, to come together to celebrate the values that have been promoted and defended by the United Nations since its creation in 1945.\nUnfortunately, the pandemic dictated otherwise, reminding us of the world\u2019s fragility and our interdependence.\nOn 9 March 2020, Burkina Faso recorded its first cases of Covid-19. The Government had to adapt its actions to the realities of the time, implementing quarantine and lockdown measures in cities, as well as various restrictions.\nMr. President, distinguished delegates,\nThe Covid-19 pandemic is a multidimensional crisis that risks destroying all development efforts in a number of countries, especially those affected by conflict.\nThat is why Burkina Faso thanks the UN Secretary-General for his global call for solidarity, launched on 31 March 2020. This call enabled the establishment of a global framework aimed at promoting an integrated and flexible response, in order to make the best use of the UN system\u2019s global footprint.\nI take this opportunity to welcome the debt relief measures in favour of developing countries, but above all to call for those debts to be cancelled outright.\nMr. President,\nLadies and Gentlemen Heads of Delegation\nA few months ago, the issue of organized crime was essentially viewed through the prism of the fight against terrorism. Today, with the emergence of the coronavirus disease pandemic, we must now take into account the triptych of organized crime, terrorism and COVID-19.\nIn the war against terrorism in the Sahel region, I would like to commend the international community\u2019s support and backing, proof if anyone still needed it that the fight against terrorism is a matter of international security.\nOn the military aspect alone, we can point to the notable progress in the activities of the G5 Sahel Joint Force and friendly troops. We also cannot ignore the highly significant involvement of the Secretary-General, the Security Council and the European Union in reviewing, in February 2020, the technical agreement between the European Union, the United Nations and the G5 Sahel, which allowed MINUSMA support for the G5 Sahel Joint Force to be extended beyond Mali\u2019s borders.\nHowever, it is regrettable that said Force is still yet to reach the desired operational level. I would therefore like to reiterate our call to the Security Council for this Force to be placed under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter and to benefit from sustainable funding.\nI also call on all partners to actively support the International Coalition for the Sahel created in Pau, France, in January 2020.\nMr. President,\nDistinguished delegates\nIn our fight against terrorism, organizations have accused our Defence and Security Forces of atrocities and human rights violations. I would like to reaffirm here that our Defence and Security Forces carry out their missions with respect for human rights, in particular the right to life and the right to physical integrity, as guaranteed by the legal instruments to which Burkina Faso is a party.\nWhenever members of our Defence and Security Forces have been implicated by allegations, investigations have been duly opened in order to identify those accountable and punish the perpetrators.\nI would like to reassure Burkina Faso\u2019s partners and the international community that, despite our modest resources, our Defence and Security Forces combat terrorism with professionalism, in strict compliance with the rules of engagement that govern their actions.\nIn any case, Burkina Faso will spare no effort in meeting the challenges of the fight against terrorism, so as to guarantee the protection of its populations and that of refugees, and we will continue to work to restore peace and security across our entire national territory, in accordance with the rules of international law.\nIn that regard, on 1 July, my Government agreed to the opening of an Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Burkina Faso.\nMr. President\nLadies and Gentlemen Heads of Delegation\nVoters will go to the polls in Burkina Faso on 22 November 2020 for joint presidential and legislative elections. The entire political class, both majority and opposition alike, consensually agreed to proceed with the elections, despite the prevailing insecurity in certain regions of the country.\nI reaffirm my government\u2019s commitment to organizing transparent, inclusive and peaceful elections. To this end, in July 2019, I instituted a permanent political dialogue framework with all components of the Burkinabe political class, in order to remove any obstacles that should arise throughout the process.\nMr. President\nDistinguished delegates\nIn Burkina Faso, we were very early to take stock of the need to preserve the environment. In all of our policies, measures are undertaken to reverse the trend of environmental degradation and to ensure the sustainable management of natural resources.\nThe tragic floods in our country and several other countries on the continent in recent weeks remind us of the need for stronger commitment to the multilateral approach, as embodied by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\nMr. President\nLadies and Gentlemen Heads of Delegation\nAs a troop-contributing country that supports the United Nations in the search for peace, Burkina Faso has, despite its own internal situation, deployed 1,130 troops, including one battalion and two formed police units and 60 individual posts.\nI wish to take this opportunity to reaffirm Burkina Faso\u2019s constant readiness to engage alongside the United Nations in seeking to achieve peace throughout the world through the deployment of its uniformed personnel and its legal experts.\nMr. President\nLadies and Gentlemen Heads of Delegation\nThe world in which we live is fearsome because international peace and security are under threat from worldwide geostrategic tensions.\nEven today, African issues are the most abundant on the Security Council\u2019s agenda.\nThe ongoing security crisis in the Sahel and in the Lake Chad Basin is a genuine concern for which answers must be found, in the knowledge that the situation in Libya is one of the causes.\nThis means that resolving the political crisis in Libya is one of the guarantees needed for peace to return in these regions. We therefore ask the Security Council to appoint the new Joint UN/African Union Special Envoy to lead the negotiations.\nIn Mali, we call for a settlement of the political crisis and a rapid return to constitutional order, and we support the decisions of ECOWAS for a smooth transition.\nOn the Western Sahara issue, the notable progress made following the convening of two round tables in Geneva between Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania and the Polisario Front deserves to be consolidated. And to achieve this, Burkina Faso wishes to see the appointment of the new Special Envoy in order to pursue the work of his or her predecessor.\nOn the situation in the Middle East, and particularly on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, there is a real need to relaunch diplomatic efforts aimed at putting an end to the conflict.\nRegarding the economic, trade and financial blockade imposed on Cuba since 1962, Burkina Faso reiterates its call for it to be lifted.\nBurkina Faso congratulates Cuba on having been able to contain the pandemic and, in a show of international solidarity, on having sent hundreds of doctors and health-care workers to more than 35 countries around the world in response to requests for urgent help.\nMr. President\nDistinguished delegates\nSeventy-five years after its creation, and after more than 20 years of intergovernmental negotiations, the reform of the United Nations is still pending. However, everyone is in agreement in acknowledging that the organization must make it possible to redress the injustice done to Africa, and that the African claim is a legitimate aspiration.\nI therefore reiterate my country\u2019s support for the African common position, as reflected in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, according to which Africa must be fully represented in all of the decision-making bodies of the United Nations, especially the Security Council.\nMr. President,\nLadies and Gentlemen Heads of Delegation\nLadies and Gentlemen\nBy adopting on 21 September the Final Declaration to commemorate the seventy-fifth anniversary of our Organization, we acknowledged that our Organization has yet to achieve the level that its founding fathers had wished for, because poverty, hunger, terrorism, extremism and even insecurity, inter alia, remain pertinent issues to this day.\nConsequently, we committed before history to leaving no one behind, to promoting peace and digital cooperation, and to taking young people, women and girls into account in all of our development policies.\nWe recognize the interdependence of the various challenges facing the United Nations, which can only be resolved by strengthening multilateralism. That is why I am hoping that the Secretary-General\u2019s report, which will be submitted to us before the culmination of the 75th session, will allow us to look to the future with greater optimism.\nOnce again, we reaffirm our collective commitment to multilateralism. The United Nations must remain our common compass.\nLong live the United Nations\nLong live international cooperation\nThank you."

        "file_text": "In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate\nMr. President of the General Assembly, Mr. Secretary-General, Your Majesties, Your Honours, Your Highnesses, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nIt is an honour for me to address this august Assembly on behalf of a new Algeria that is eager to build a democratic system that reflects the aspirations of its people. Indeed, the Algerian people have proven themselves to be exemplary in the defence of the values of freedom and justice.\nAt the outset, I would like to express my wishes to His Excellency Mr. Volkan Bozkir as he assumes the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-fifth session, following His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, who ably managed the previous session. I also wish to commend the tireless efforts of Mr. Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations.\nOur Organization, which was founded in the wake of a horrific human tragedy, has experienced both successes and failures in the face of an increasing number of various international challenges. Those challenges have revealed many flaws in the international system, especially in light of the current health circumstances.\nOur belief in the need for a strong international organization leads us to reaffirm the necessity to advance the comprehensive reform of our Organization in order to improve its performance and enhance its efficiency. In that regard, Algeria reiterates its adherence to the position of the African Union in accordance with the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. We call upon the need for reaching prompt solutions through intergovernmental negotiations on the issue of equitable representation in the Security Council and expanding its membership, inter alia.\nIn the fifty-eight years since it became a State Member of the United Nations, my country has endeavoured to defend international peace and security through its foreign policy based on the principles of promoting peaceful solutions to conflicts, non-interference in the internal affairs of States, respect for their sovereignty and unity, while respecting the rights of peoples to self-determination and to manage their resources. We are proud of the results we have achieved, which further affirm that Algerian diplomacy has played a central role in the resolution of many arduous crises along with regional and international conflicts. Our foreign policy continues to be aimed at serving that noble objective.\nBased on that approach, Algeria has worked \u2014 and will continue to work \u2014 on rapprochement between the stakeholders in Libya. We call on our Libyan brothers to engage constructively in the political process under the auspices of the United Nations in order to overcome the current crisis and meet the aspirations of the Libyan people. We condemn any foreign intervention that undermines the sovereignty of the country. Algeria welcomes the recently announced ceasefire and calls on the parties to translate it into actions without delay.\nMy country is closely following the delicate situation in Mali, our neighbour and brother, and looks forward to a swift restoration of the constitutional order through a consensus-based transition that enshrines the will and aspirations of the Malian people for security, stability and development. We are convinced that the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali, borne out of the Algiers process, remains the ideal framework for tackling the challenges of political governance and economic development in Mali with the wise and sincere support of the international community.\nTurning now to the Palestinian Question, which remains the sacred and main issue to Algeria and its people, we wish to reiterate our steadfast support for the Palestinian people in their just cause and inalienable rights. We call for the establishment of their independent, sovereign State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. We believe that resolving the Palestinian question is key to stability in the Middle East.\nWith regard to Western Sahara, we regret the obstacles hindering a settlement to the issue, in particular the stalled negotiations between the two parties to the conflict and delays in appointing a new envoy for Western Sahara.\nAlgeria calls for the implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions, especially those concerning the holding of a self-determination referendum in Western Sahara, which has been postponed for over 29 years; the swift appointment of an envoy of the Secretary-General; and the resumption of negotiations between the two parties to the conflict, aimed at fulfilling the aspirations of the peoples of the Maghreb and Africa for development and integration.\nAlgeria renews its commitment to fighting terrorism and violent extremism, which it considers to be a grave threat to peace, security and development in the world. We call for promoting international cooperation against corruption and moneylaundering while implementing the relevant international agreements, in particular those concerning the retrieval of funds stolen from the people.\nIn line with our commitment to fostering and strengthening international peace and security, my country is actively involved in international efforts in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation. Algeria has suffered and continues to be severely affected by the nuclear tests that were conducted on its territory during colonial rule.\nThe complete elimination of nuclear weapons remains, in our view, the only way to rid humankind of the risks such weapons pose. Algeria also attaches a great deal of importance to environmental issues and renews its commitment to all relevant agreements. Despite our limited resources, we are also making great efforts at the national level in that regard, for example by including environmental aspects in State public policies. Turning to the historic responsibility of developed countries on this issue, we renew our call for strengthened technical and financial support for developing countries in order to address the environmental threats they are facing.\nAlgerian women took part in the national revolution for liberation and antiterrorism. They have played a pivotal role in the national reconstruction process promoted by Algeria, which also pays particular attention to young people and their participation in public life.\nThe difficult circumstances imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic have not deterred Algeria from striving to implement the Sustainable Development Goals. In that connection, my country is currently finalizing a national framework for indicators to measure the progress made towards achieving those Goals. We are also working on integrating the Sustainable Development Goals into our annual budgetary laws in the near term and creating a legal framework aimed at facilitating and enhancing the work of all stakeholders involved in that process.\nAlgeria is steadily making progress towards strengthening the pillars of democracy, the rule of law and social justice following a democratic change achieved by a peaceful and civilized protest movement, resulting in presidential elections held in December 2019. Those elections reaffirmed the sovereignty of the Algerian people and its freedom to choose and to make its own decisions. Algeria has made great strides in its political, economic and social reforms in recent months, despite the challenging health situation, in order to build a new, strong, secure and prosperous Algeria.\nIn that context, Algeria will organize a referendum to be held on 1 November on the draft reform of the Constitution in order to determine the foundations of a democratic political system that will guarantee the protection of rights and freedoms and ensure a balance between the various branches of government. The chosen date is highly symbolic and represents our respect for the sacrifices of the martyrs who died so that a free and independent Algeria could live.\nIn conclusion, I would like to appeal for unity and solidarity so that we may overcome our differences and tackle the difficult situation the world is facing in order to enable our countries and our peoples to continue on the path towards stability, security and development.\nI thank you for your kind attention. May peace and God\u2019s mercy and blessings be upon you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President of the United Nations General Assembly;\nMr. Secretary-General;\nHeads of state and government;\nExcellencies:\nI am honored to address you today on behalf of the Filipino people on the 75th anniversary of the United Nations.\nThe invisible enemy that is COVID-19 has brought about an unfamiliar global landscape and unleashed a crisis without precedent. It is the biggest test the world and the United Nations faced since the Second World War.\nWhile the United Nations has brought relief and hope to so many countries and peoples around the world, it now finds itself saddled by a virus that has taken many lives and wrecked economies and social order.\nWe are at a crossroads. How we address COVID-19 will define our future.\nFor the Philippines, this means putting up all of the peoples of our united nations at the core of this response.\nWe will need to ask hard and fundamental questions about the vision and mission that the United Nations conceptualized 75 years ago.\nWe need to ask ourselves whether or not we have remained true and faithful to the United Nations\u2019 principles and ideals.\nMr. President, in the light of the realities of the present, the Philippines grieves with all of the families all over the world who lost their loved ones to this horrible virus.\nWe extend our heartfelt condolences.\nWe salute all frontliners who put their lives on the line even in countries not their own. So also do we honor and recognize the healthcare professionals who selflessly answered the call to combat the COVID-19 pandemic despite its virulence and unknown characteristics.\nWhile each nation has its own strategy in fighting the pandemic, what the world needs are coordinated international plans and efforts to pursue a common purpose.\nCOVID-19 knows no border. It knows no nationality. It knows no race. It knows no gender. It knows no age. It knows no creed.\nThe Philippines values the role that the United Nations plays in its fight against the pandemic. As a middle-income country whose economic advances have been derailed by the pandemic, we welcome the launch of the UN COVID Response and Recovery Fund.\nEnsuring universal access to anti COVID-19 technologies and products is pivotal in the global pandemic recovery.\nThe world is in the race to find a safe and effective vaccine.\nWhen the world finds that vaccine, access to it must not be denied nor withheld. It should be made available to all, rich and poor nations alike, as a matter of policy.\nThe Philippines joins our partners in the ASEAN and the Non-Aligned Movement in raising our collective voice: the COVID-19 vaccine must be considered a global public good. Let us be clear on this.\nWe call for a global health agenda with enough resources and policy space for the World Health Organization.\nWe need a WHO that is quick to coordinate and quicker to respond. The Philippines will do its part in the pooling of global resources. Our health workers are among the best.\nMr. President, just as we needed stability and confidence because of the pandemic, geopolitical tensions continue to rise.\nEscalating tensions benefit no one. New flashpoints heighten fears and tend to tear peoples apart.\nWhen elephants fight, it is the grass that gets trampled flat.\nGiven the size and military might of the contenders, we can only imagine and be aghast at the terrible toll on human life and property that shall be inflicted if the \u201cword war\u201d deteriorates into a real war of nuclear weapons and missiles.\nI therefore call on the stakeholders in the South China Sea, the Korean Peninsula, the Middle East and Africa: if we cannot be friends as yet, then in God\u2019s name, let us not hate each other too much. I heard it once said, and I say it to myself in complete agreement.\nMr. President, Filipino migrant workers have been devastated by the pandemic. Many have lost not only their livelihood, but also their health and lives as well. Yet they go on in the frontlines, healing, caring for others in the different parts of the world.\nThe Philippine Government has embarked on an unprecedented repatriation program. More than 345,000 overseas Filipino workers needed to come home then. We have brought back half and are bringing back the rest.\nWe thank the countries that have provided Filipino migrants with residence permits, access to testing, treatment and related health services in this pandemic.\nWe brought back most of our seafarers who were stranded because of COVID 19 restrictions. We pioneered with the IMO the Green Lane for safe changes of seafaring crews.\nIn these times, we need stronger cooperation in promoting and protecting the rights of migrants, regardless of their migrant status.\nWe must all adhere to the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. Unless states include all migrants in their response to this pandemic, \u201cno one among us is safe, until everyone is safe\u201d, as the Secretary-General has said.\nWith the poverty rate reduced at 16.6 per cent; and a sustained economic growth rate of 6.4 per cent between 2010 and 2019, the Philippines was on track to becoming an upper-middle income country by the end of 2020. But the pandemic has placed our economy in recession.\nDespite this downward pressure on growth, the Philippines remains committed to the Sustainable Development Goals.\nMr. President, the same urgency needed to fight COVID-19 is needed to address the climate crisis. This is a global challenge that has worsened existing inequalities and vulnerabilities from within and between nations.\nClimate change has worsened the ravages of the pandemic.\nPeoples in developing countries like the Philippines suffer the most. We cannot afford to suffer more.\nThe Philippines joined the Paris Agreement to fight climate change. We call on all parties, especially those who have not made good their commitment to fight climate change, to honor the same.\nWe call on all parties to strengthen communities and peoples for preparedness and resilience. We are talking about mankind and Earth, our one and only home.\nMr. President, the Philippines will continue to protect the human rights of its people, especially from the scourge of illegal drugs, criminality, and terrorism.\nA number of interest groups have weaponized human rights; some well meaning, others ill-intentioned.\nThey attempt to discredit the functioning institutions and mechanisms of a democratic country and a popularly elected government which in its last two years, still enjoy the same widespread approval and support.\nThese detractors pass themselves off as human rights advocates while preying on the most vulnerable humans; even using children as soldiers or human shields in encounters. Even schools are not spared from their malevolence and anti-government propaganda.\nThey hide their misdeeds under the blanket of human rights but the blood oozes through.\nTo move forward, open dialogue and constructive engagement with the United Nations is the key.\nBut these must be done in full respect of the principles of objectivity, non interference, non-selectivity and genuine dialogue. These are the fundamental bases for productive international cooperation on human rights.\nMr. President, terrorism looms large.\nAs I said at the Aqaba Process, the Philippines will do everything and partner with anyone who would sincerely desire to protect the innocent from terrorism in all its manifestations.\nThe Marawi siege, where foreign terrorist fighters took part, taught us that an effective legal framework is crucial. Our 2020 Anti-Terrorism Act shores up the legal framework by focusing on both terrorism and the usual reckless response to it.\nIts enactment was done pursuant to our commitment, and the strict adherence to the relevant Security Council resolutions and the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.\nMost importantly, we remain committed to rebuild stricken communities and address the root causes of terrorism and violent extremism in my country.\nWe must remain mindful of our obligations and commitment to the Charter of the United Nations and as amplified by the 1982 Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes.\nThe Philippines affirms that commitment in the South China Sea in accordance with UNCLOS and the 2016 Arbitral Award.\nThe Award is now part of international law, beyond compromise and beyond the reach of passing governments to dilute, diminish or abandon.\nWe firmly reject attempts to undermine it.\nWe welcome the increasing number of states that have come in support of the award and what it stands for \u2014 the triumph of reason over rashness, of law over disorder, of amity over ambition. This \u2014 as it should be \u2014 is the majesty of the law.\nMr. President, the global health crisis has further complicated the global security environment. But no aspiration nor ambition can justify the use of weapons that destroy indiscriminately and completely.\nThere is no excuse for deaths that a nuclear war could cause nor the reckless use of chemical and biological weapons that can cause mass destruction.\nThese weapons of death put us all at mortal risk, especially if they fall in the hands of terrorists without a shred of humanity in their souls.\nWe call on all Member States to fully implement the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the Chemical and the Biological Weapons Conventions.\nI have asked the Philippine Senate to ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Importantly, we were among those to sign it first.\nMr. President, the Philippines has a long history of opening its doors to the refugees \u2014 from the White Russians following the 1917 Revolution, the European Jews in the Second World War, the Vietnamese in the late 1960s, and the Iranians displaced by the 1979 revolution, among others.\nThe Philippines continues to honor this humanitarian tradition in accordance with our obligations under the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol.\nBut lest we forget: helping the most vulnerable \u2014 those displaced by conflict, persecution, and political instability \u2014 is a shared responsibility of all countries.\nAs I have said many times: The doors of the Philippines are open, as they have always been, to everyone fleeing for safety, such as the Rohingyas.\nIn the face of a mounting refugee crisis worldwide, let us work together towards ending the conflicts and conditions that force people to flee their homes.\nMr. President, as our societies become more diverse yet interdependent, social cohesion issues come to the fore.\nMutual understanding always accompanied by mutual tolerance between those of different faiths and cultures is the only foundation of societies at peace with itself and all others.\nFinally, I express gratitude to the gallant peacekeepers, including our own, who advance the cause of peace in the most difficult situations.\nFrom the Golan Heights in the Middle East to Liberia in West Africa, Filipino peacekeepers put themselves in the frontlines between the vulnerable and those who seek harm.\nWe are committed to increasing the Philippine footprint in UN peacekeeping operations with increased participation of women.\nAgain Mr. President: To defeat the COVID-19 pandemic and other challenges, we must work with seamless unity which demands complete mutual trust and the conviction that we will win or lose together.\nWe cannot bring back the dead but we can spare the living; and we can build back better, healthier, and more prosperous and just societies.\nTo this end, we rededicate ourselves to multilateralism. The UN remains humanity\u2019s essential organization. But it is only as effective as we make it.\nTo make significant changes, we need to be bold. We need the same collective courage that finally made the United Nations a reality 75 years ago.\nWe need to act on long-standing recommendations to improve the Security Council\u2019s composition and working methods; to strengthen the role of the General Assembly; and to streamline the processes and the operations of the UN.\nIndeed, to be ready for the new global normal, it cannot be business as usual for the UN.\nLet us empower UN \u2014 reform it \u2014 to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.\nLet us strengthen it so it can fully deliver its mandate to maintain peace and security, uphold justice and human rights, and promote freedom and social progress for all.\nAfter all, we are the United Nations. Thank you."

        "file_text": "Distinguished Mr. President,\nExcellencies,\nEsteemed Delegates,\nI congratulate Mr. Volkan Bozkir, President of the 75th Session of the UN General Assembly on his election to this honourable function and wish to express Poland's full support for his mission. I would also like to thank Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande for his active presidency over the works of the 74th Session of the UN General Assembly.\nMr. President,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nThis year's 75th Session of the UN General Assembly is an extraordinary one and it will surely go down in history as such. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed not only the course of the event, but has also forced us to embark upon a completely new reflection exercise as well as look for solutions to the problems which the world has not grappled with for years on such a huge scale.\nInternational situation is increasingly complicated whereas the palette of challenges and threats we face is constantly growing.\nUpon completion of its two-year-long mandate in the Security Council last year, Poland continues to be engaged in its areas of priority, also within the framework of its three-year-long term in the Human Rights Council, which commenced this January.\nRespect for international law, multilateral cooperation of states, international humanitarian law, protection of human rights and taking care of the natural environment are among themes of pivotal importance to Poland.\nI wish that the adopted anniversary declaration, marking 75 years of the United Nations Organization, not only confirmed the obligations assumed by the founding fathers. I wish that the said declaration was an expression of the longevity of ideas forming the basis of our cooperation and a testimony of the political will to implement them. I wish it was a declaration of \u201cglobal solidarity\u201d.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nEsteemed Delegates,\nDuring my first term as Head of State, Poland intensified its presence within the United Nations system. We held a two-year-long mandate in the Security Council, we hosted climate conference COP24 in 2018 whereas our soldiers returned to the UN-peace keeping force in Lebanon, as part of UNIFIL. It was my personal decision that Poland should support \u2014 in deeds, not just with words \u2014 the efforts of the international community in the areas of key importance in the contemporary times.\nThe UN has immense achievements in securing peace, containing conflicts, and stabilizing situation in many regions of the world. And we must not let it be squandered. Striving for more effectiveness, reform of the structures and utilizing experiences, including the adjustment of failed solutions, must not serve as a tool for undermining the value of the Organization as a whole. Also, the approach to its individual agendas requires prudence and deep reflection.\nWe share a number of reservations and declare our readiness for a constructive discussion and active engagement while defending the achievements of the UN, which are undeniable and constitute a common political legacy of humanity. Construction through destruction of things that already exist is not only costly, but very risky at the same time. It creates the danger of shaking up the foundations of the strenuously developed rules and values and supplanting traditions as well as historical experiences.\nEsteemed Delegates,\nThe theme of this year s session is looking for common and uniting answers to today's global challenges. Whenever we talk about community building in Poland and discuss common and selfless action in the name of a higher purpose, then there is always one word which springs to mind: SOLIDARITY.\nThis August in Poland we proudly celebrated a splendid anniversary: 40 years since the establishment of \u201cSolidarity\u201d \u2014 a grand social movement which led to the fall of the Iron Curtain and brought liberty, sovereignty and independence to Poland, Polish People as well as to other States and Nations in Central and Eastern Europe, and as a result to the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the demise of the \u201cevil empire\u201d \u2014 that is the Soviet Union. By the same token, the period of the Cold War came to an end. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, the world today would look quite different if it was not for \u201cSolidarity\u201d.\nTherefore, today, 40 years since the establishment of \u201cSolidarity\u201d in Poland and 75 years since setting-up of the United Nations Organization, I wish to urge all Heads of State and Government and all Esteemed Delegates to co-create the idea of \u201cGLOBAL SOLIDARITY\u201d. This very idea should be the lodestar in our daily mission. I firmly believe that just like the \u201cSolidarity\u201d movement in Poland changed the course of history, also the \u201cGLOBAL SOLIDARITY\u201d might become the idea which will help to overcome contemporary crises in the world.\nThree of these are, as far as I'm concerned, especially tangible and acute.\nThe first one is the socio-economic crisis, which results from a phenomenon we were unable to predict and for which we could not comprehensively prepare ourselves, i.e. the coronavirus pandemic. We all have been taken by surprise by how things developed over the last six months. Each and every state has had to face up to completely novel challenges. These have generated not only health related consequences but more broadly also social and economic ones. The fight with the pandemic demands more intensive cooperation and precisely SOLIDARITY.\nThe second one is either the newly emerging or the re-emerging crisis of the quality of relations between states. Unfortunately, it is increasingly the case that the relations turn into a confrontation, rivalry and even imperial domination. The fact that we have managed to avoid another global armed conflict in the last 75 years should doubtlessly be deemed as one of the success stories of the international community. Simultaneously however, one can hardly say that those were the years of global security and global peace. The world was and still is shaken up by various kinds of aggression \u2014 from terrorist attacks to numerous regional conflicts, many of which have turned over time into the so called frozen conflicts and are incredibly difficult to solve. The policy of strength and aggression is by no means happening exclusively in the peripheries. It is also applied in the region of the world in which my country, Poland is located \u2014 in our closest neighbourhood.\nThe third crisis results from lack of relevant tools for efficient transformation of economies allowing them to maintain a permanent and stable level of economic growth while taking care of the quality of the natural environment. That definitely is one of the most fundamental challenges facing humanity today and in the nearest future.\nI believe these crises will remain unsolved unless we focus on the idea of \u201cSOLIDARITY\u201d.\nTherefore, it is important to make sure that the fight against inter alia the impact of the coronavirus pandemic does not result in deeper economic divisions among states and societies; that it does not assume the form of a ruthless economic rivalry and result in the wealthier ones getting richer at the cost of the poorer. By the same token however, that fight must not lead to constraining the sphere of our liberty whereas access to medical solutions must not depend on the size of the wallet.\nLadies and Gentlemen, I urge you to act together. In the name of SOLIDARITY Poland deployed, at the height of the pandemic, a number of military medical missions, among others to Italy and the United States, in order to help, acquire and share the knowledge on how to fight the pandemic and better respond to potential future crises.\nCounteracting the economic dimension of the pandemic was one of the themes of a letter which I sent to European leaders in late April this year. In the letter I requested that, in the course of their economic recovery efforts, our governments care, more resolutely than before, not merely about robust GDP growth, but also about sustainable development of the countries in other aspects, including fair and efficient distribution of funds among those in need. Moreover, I urged European leaders to give together a new impulse to stimulate production in Europe, which would undoubtedly shorten supply chains, among other things. If we want to be, once again, a great innovative \u201cproduction workshop\u201d we must act together. From the perspective of our economic subjectivity this is of strategic importance.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nIn terms of the crisis in the quality of relations among states, I wish to stress that one of Poland's unchanging priorities is the question of respect for international law. There cannot and there will not be a lasting peace in the world unless law is abided by. Our attachment to this value is mirrored by the slogan \u201cpeace through law\u201d, which we promoted inter alia during our two-year-long term as an elected member state of the Security Council. In our actions undertaken in the UN forum we are consistent in highlighting the fundamental role of international law in preserving the global security architecture. It is indispensable to ensure cooperation among states in a situation when the fundamental norms of international law are violated, for instance in case of the aggression of the Russian Federation on Georgia or Ukraine.\nAnother concerning phenomenon refers to the violation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons, which was repeatedly the case in recent years. Poland did not and does not accept the fact that chemical weapons are still in use. On top of that, and that is even more concerning: the infringement of the Convention in 2018 coincided with the violation of the fundamental principle of international law: sovereignty and territorial integrity. It is upon our shoulders: those of the UN, the Security Council and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons that the responsibility rests to communicate to the world our strong opposition in this matter.\nIt is only through the enforcement of the fundamental principles and norms of international law enshrined among others in the Declaration on Principles of International Law adopted by the General Assembly half a century ago, will we succeed in building lasting peace and a safe world of equal states and free nations with no spheres of influence. Leaving cases of violation of international law, including interference in sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, unanswered by the international community will every time act as an encouragement to repeat such negative behaviour. Infringement of the norms of international law must result in consequences whereas those responsible must be held accountable.\nPoland keeps underlining, in an incessant and consistent manner, the importance and the unique role of two other sub-areas of international law: human rights and international humanitarian law.\nInternational humanitarian law and human rights are among greatest achievements of the international community in its striving to limit suffering and ensure respect for the rights of the civilian population in armed conflicts. The dissemination of the role of international humanitarian law is high on the agenda of the priorities of Polish foreign policy in recent years.\nTherefore, I have appealed to the international community, through the UN Human Rights Council in which Poland currently holds a three year-long mandate, to pay attention to the violation of human rights in Belarus. I am glad that the Council has held a meeting dedicated to this issue.\nIn the name of SOLIDARITY we should all speak with one voice and demand that fundamental human rights be respected both in Belarus and in other places across the globe. Repressions of political opponents, mass detentions of peaceful protesters or violence and torture being applied against them cannot be tolerated in any state. Belarusians, just like any other free nation, have the right to shape their political future in a sovereign way, without external interference, without domination of other capitals, with the right to freely participate in international cooperation in line with their national interests.\nThe third on the list of crises in today's world is inadequate balancing of the environmental changes while staying on the path of economic development. We firmly believe it is necessary to create a more resilient, inclusive and environment- friendly economy. As a three-time host of the UN climate conferences: COP14 in Poznan in 2008, COP19 in Warsaw in 2013 and COP24 in Katowice in 2018, Poland is committed to fight with environmental changes.\nAt the same time, we argue that on the path leading to the attainment of the agreed goals we have to make sure that our actions are safe for the citizens, economies and states. We need a climate friendly transition, which will be fair and balanced and take domestic conditions of every state into account.\nWe have already launched a transition aimed at ensuring a just green and low-emission economy. We know however that in this effort it is impossible to be successful on your own. It requires responsible cooperation of us all.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nEsteemed Delegates,\nIn view of the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, fragile and too frequently violated international law and the need to transform our economies, we should be led by more than just the principle of common responsibility. These days it is also important to act in accordance with the ideals of SOLIDARITY. Poland invites all UN members to act in solidarity while countering the crises which are currently affecting us.\nAs life has shown, we as international community, have to face up to frequently unprecedented challenges \u2014 also the ones we do not expect. I believe that through common responsibility and SOLIDARITY we are going to find an effective response to them."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nMr. Secretary-General,\nYour Majesties,\nYour Excellencies,\nDistinguished Delegates,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nAyubowan!\nAt the outset, I congratulate Your Excellency Volkan Bozkir on being elected as the President of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. We wish you success and assure you of our fullest cooperation.\nI take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to His Excellency Prof. Tijani Muhammad-Bande, for his effective stewardship of the last General Assembly.\nI wish to extend Sri Lanka\u2019s appreciation to the Secretary-General His Excellency Antonio Guterres for his dynamic leadership and untiring efforts in pursuing the objectives of the United Nations, even amidst unprecedented conditions brought about by the pandemic.\nThe effort taken to hold the UN General Assembly in a modified format, in keeping with the current constraints is commendable.\nI extend my deepest condolences to all those who have lost loved ones due to the pandemic and express deep appreciation to the frontline healthcare and essential workers, both in Sri Lanka and globally, for their dedication and selfless commitment.\nThe theme of this year\u2019s General Debate is timely, and echoes the importance of solidarity across national borders in alleviating the effects of COVID-19.\nWe commend the efforts taken by the UN to respond to this challenge, including the COVID 19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan and the establishment of the United Nations COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund.\nSri Lanka supports the extensive work being carried out by the WHO, which has played a critical role in shaping the global response to the pandemic. The WHO now must seek to facilitate universal access to a COVID-19 vaccine, once developed, which should be designated as a basic public good and be affordable and obtainable by all.\nAs a country proud of her long-standing democratic traditions, the Government of Sri Lanka has witnessed two free and fair elections, where I as the President and my Government were elected with overwhelming majorities.\nThe resounding mandates received at both the Presidential and Parliamentary elections have enabled the formation of a strong Government, dedicated to building a prosperous nation.\nAt a time when even the most powerful countries in the world were facing substantial challenges in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, Sri Lanka was able to successfully face the challenge.\nThanks to a well-coordinated and synchronized mechanism of preventive measures at the national level, assisted by a robust local healthcare system, we managed to contain its spread. I must thank the people of my country for the cooperation they extended in this monumental task.\nSri Lanka\u2019s sustenance during this calamity was due to the series of inclusive, non-discriminatory and holistic measures taken by the Government, prioritizing the health and safety of her people.\nThese measures include, financially supporting low income families, pensioners, differently-abled, day-income earners, farmers, and disadvantaged groups and managing the repatriation of Sri Lankans in a coordinated manner.\nSri Lanka also explored avenues of business to create new economic trends. This included the use of digital technology to connect the farmer, supplier and consumer; to deliver essential items and services; and to provide on line education.\nThese measures ensured the \u2018right to life\u2019 of all Sri Lankans and all foreign nationals who were trapped during restrictions on air travel, regardless of their ethnic, religious or social background.\nThe WHO has commended Sri Lanka\u2019s efforts to control COVID-19 more effectively even with modest means, than more resourced countries.\nSri Lanka was among the first countries in South Asia to open schools to bring children back in safety, as commended by UNICEF. The World Travel and Tourism Council has recently stamped Sri Lanka as a safe destination for tourists.\nSri Lanka notes with deep concern that developing countries are facing an unprecedented economic and debt crisis due to the pandemic, and the need for debt relief and financial stimulus for such countries must be duly recognized.\nSri Lanka is committed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nMoreover, we, as a country, are extremely serious about protecting our environment. With a bio-diversity that is unique to us, we are ensuring that our environmental assets are not only duly preserved but also prudently used. My government is taking all measures to strike the right balance between preserving the environment and taking development forward.\nThe recent debacle involving an oil tanker in our seas was carefully managed ensuring that our marine resources are in no way compromised. As a small country with limited resources to handle disasters of this magnitude, we, with the help of the neighbouring countries, minimized the damage caused by the oil tanker to the marine habitat.\nSri Lanka welcomes the initiative of the President of the 74th General Assembly for launching the Alliance for Poverty Eradication, which will mobilize action on this issue.\nBased on the vision of my policy statement \u201cVistas of Prosperity and Splendour\u201d, a Presidential Task Force in charge of Economic Revival and Poverty Eradication was established to create a production economy. The Task Force is focusing on creating a unique economic structure based on novel initiatives.\nThis complements my country\u2019s long and consistent history of protecting our society from extreme poverty. Our government is taking a bold and creative initiative to reduce poverty in the country by targeting poor families and providing a member of each such family wage employment that will help the family to come out of poverty and look to the future with hope.\nWe are convinced that education is an important tool for emerging out of poverty.\nIn Sri Lanka, the National Education System is being restructured according to the theme, \u201cEqual learning opportunity for every child\u201d envisaged in the national policy framework. Many rural schools are being upgraded and others modernized to equip children with knowledge and skills that would help them to contribute to the development of the country.\nA cost-free official \u201ce-learning portal\u201d for school children, with the support of all telecommunication operators, has successfully contributed towards home learning during the pandemic.\nState Ministries have been established recently, covering all areas of education for women, children and youth of the country, placing emphasis on vocational and technical education and training.\nSri Lanka remains deeply committed to addressing drug-related socio economic issues. There is a need to enhance efforts to strengthen the prevention of drug abuse among children and youth, and ensure that educational settings are free of any harmful and addictive drugs.\nSri Lanka is extremely concerned about the increasing sophistication of the transnational criminal groups engaged in illicit manufacture and trafficking of drugs.\nIn order to address this, a Presidential Task Force was appointed to eradicate the drug menace, and to create a safer and a more secure country. Since its establishment, it has produced commendable results.\nSri Lanka, having experienced separatism and terrorism for near three decades, condemns all terrorist acts in the strongest possible terms, be it domestic or international.\nIn spite of its elimination from the Sri Lankan soil, the international network of this terrorist outfit remains, pushing its ruthless ideology and influencing certain Capitals to spread its baseless lies and propaganda.\nWe are hopeful that no State will tolerate activities of this international network which continues to espouse and propagate violent ideology under different guises and manifestations.\nThe global community must stand in solidarity with Sri Lanka, notwithstanding narrow domestic political compulsions, to counter terrorism. This ideology that introduced suicide bombings to the world has set precedents for acts of violent extremism across the world. This is evident by the growing recruitment drive of the extremist outfits.\nIt is the hope of my people that the world community will not seek to forget or rewrite the violent past of this terrorist organization and allow the propagation of the group\u2019s propaganda, which aimed at indoctrination and radicalization of another generation of youth.\nAs a nation that has witnessed the bitterness of war, Sri Lanka is committed to promoting peace across the world. We remain fully committed to UN Peacekeeping.\nWe are proud to have a long association with United Nations Peacekeeping Operations, with over 20,000 Sri Lankan Peacekeepers having served in UN Peace Missions across the world. They are providing critical services to conflict affected communities in most difficult and dangerous terrains.\nAs a Nation, we are keen to contribute to the common goal of global peace and security.\nAt a time when the United Nations reaches its 75th year, it is a great opportunity to self-assess the approach and success towards maintaining international peace, security and development.\nThe UN system needs to ensure equity, inclusivity and transparency, while being more responsive to the ever-changing global environment.\nIn order to ensure the sustainability and the credibility of the Organization, political witch hunts through questionable motives against Member States, need to be halted.\nDemocratically elected governments of nations understand the pulse and needs of their people the best. It is the responsibility of the UN to assist and support processes of such elected Governments to bring about sustainable solutions for needs of their people.\nSri Lanka is committed to follow a neutral foreign policy with no affiliations to any particular country or power bloc.\nAs a strategically placed country in the Indian Ocean, it is our priority to ensure that the Indian Ocean is maintained as a zone of peace where no country could gain advantage over any other.\nMoreover, the Indian Ocean has many international sea lanes that are economically important to a large number of nations and therefore, should remain accessible to global trade and commerce.\nGeopolitically, too, the Indian Ocean receives the focus of the entire world. Given this situation, powerful countries and nations should provide their support and assistance to maintain the neutrality of the Indian Ocean and to protect its valuable marine resources.\nIn conclusion, I wish to re-iterate the importance of the UN charter which enshrines the protection of sovereignty, territorial integrity of States and non-interference in their domestic affairs.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "On behalf of the delegation of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fifth session. I am confident that under your able stewardship the session will be very fruitful.\nThe Assembly\u2019s current session is taking place in unprecedented circumstances. The world pandemic has claimed more than a million precious lives and plunged the whole world into extreme anxiety and chaos. The delegation of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea would like to take this opportunity to offer its deep sympathies and condolences to the bereaved families whose loved ones have lost their lives and to the Governments of all the countries that have suffered enormous human and material losses due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We would also like to express our firm solidarity with all the medical workers of every country, and to the World Health Organization and the other international organizations that are sparing no effort in their sacred cause of preventing the spread of the pandemic and saving humankind.\nToday\u2019s stern reality, in which COVID-19 is becoming ever more serious as the days go by, demands that the Governments of all countries display effective leadership with a sense of their heavy responsibility for the safety of their people\u2019s lives. Thanks to the far-sighted leadership of the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, which maintains a people-first policy as its political philosophy and guiding idea, the situation combating the epidemic in our country is now under safe and stable control. During the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, Chairman Kim Jong Un of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, with extraordinary wisdom and determination, ensured that preemptive, timely and strong emergency measures were taken to prevent the entry and spread of the pandemic. In response to the rising number of global infections, the State is now taking a series of measures to block the virus from entering the country. All our citizens are adhering strictly to the anti-epidemic regulations while remaining on high alert. The Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea will not tolerate even the slightest carelessness or compromise, but will further strengthen the State\u2019s emergency anti-epidemic measures until the danger of the pandemic crossing its borders is completely eliminated, thereby firmly safeguarding the safety of the people and the security of the State.\nBuilding a peaceful world without war has always been the goal of the Government of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. In the past few decades we have done everything possible to safeguard peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in the region. That notwithstanding, the nuclear threat to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea continues unabated, along with all sorts of hostile acts taking place before our very eyes. It is an undeniable reality today that cutting-edge military hardware, including stealth fighters, continues to be introduced into the Korean peninsula and that nuclear-strike weapons of all kinds are aimed directly at our country.\nThe conclusion we have drawn is that peace never comes of its own accord or through the mere wish of one side; nor is it granted by anyone else. In today\u2019s world, where high-handedness based on strength is rampant, genuine peace can be safeguarded only when one possesses the absolute strength needed to prevent war itself. Since we obtained a reliable and effective deterrent to war in our self-defence by tightening our belts, peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in the region are now firmly assured.\nBased on its reliable guarantee of safeguarding the security of its State and people, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea is now directing all its efforts towards economic construction. It is a fact that we badly need an external environment favourable to building our economy, but we cannot sell off our dignity, which we have defended because it is as valuable as our very lives, in the mere hope of a brilliant transformation. That is our steadfast position. At the historic fifth plenary meeting of the seventh Central Committee of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea held in December of last year, Chairman Kim Jong Un put forward a vision aimed at breaking through the difficulties facing our socialist construction by confronting them head-on through self-reliance.\nGreat projects are being completed one after another, on a basis of self-reliance and self-development, to celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the founding of the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea and its brilliant labour achievements. At a time when the world was in despair as it was drawn into the catastrophe of the pandemic crisis, we in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea were launching the construction of Pyongyang General Hospital as a modern medical service facility for the people, and we have now dynamically propelled its construction into the final stage. Although this year we suffered considerable losses, owing to unexpected natural disasters, we are striving vigorously to repair the damage caused by floods and typhoons by ourselves and to stabilize our people\u2019s lives as quickly as possible. The manoeuvres of hostile forces to stifle the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, along with numerous other difficulties, will continue to hinder our progress. However, the people will also further intensify their struggle to overcome them and open up a road to prosperity through their own efforts.\nIt has been 75 years since the United Nations took its first step. Humankind, together with the United Nations, is looking back on the 75 years that have passed and at the same time is envisioning a better future. The main theme of this general debate, namely \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism \u2014 confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action\u201d, reflects the demand of an overwhelming majority of the States Members of the United Nations that we build a peaceful and prosperous world on the basis of multilateralism. Multilateralism makes it possible to achieve peace and security and sustainable development by establishing cooperative relations among Member States based on the recognition that they have different ideas, systems, cultures and values. That should be encouraged and promoted, as it fully aligns with the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\nThe time is long gone when an individual country could hold sway over international politics, unilaterally imposing its will on the world, and multilateralism has become an irresistible global trend. The future that humankind wants is an independent world, free from domination, subordination, aggression or interference, where the sovereignty and equality of all countries and nations are ensured. The United Nations is needed to achieve that purpose. The United Nations should firmly adhere to the principles of sovereign equality, mutual respect, impartiality and objectivity. It should have zero tolerance of high-handedness and arbitrariness, and it should eliminate biased practices and double standards in all its activities in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter.\nIn that context, we categorically condemn and reject the economic, trade and financial blockade of Cuba, an economic genocide that has continued for decades in gross violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law and an infringement on sovereignty. We strongly demand that it be terminated immediately. We extend our unwavering support to and solidarity with the Syrian people in their struggle to regain the Israeli-occupied Golan and defend its territorial integrity, as well as to the righteous cause of the people of Palestine to establish their own independent State with East Jerusalem as its capital. We also extend our support and solidarity to the Government and the people of Venezuela in their struggle to reject the interference of foreign forces and defend the sovereignty of their country.\nThe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea will develop good-neighbourly and fraternal relations with all countries across the world that respect its sovereignty and are friendly to it, and will make a determined effort to safeguard peace and security in the region and the world at large."

        "file_text": "Your Excellency Mr. President, Excellency Mr. Secretary-General, Ladies and Gentlemen!\nAt the outset I with great delight extend heartfelt congratulations to Mr.Volkan Bozkir on his election as the President of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly.\nThe current situation in the world has become complicated, volatile and turbulent at the background of growing geopolitical, geo-economic competition and extension of modern threats and challenges, particularly a spread of coronavirus disease.\nCOVID-19 has initially been appeared as a healthcare crisis and been gradually turned into a justifiable global socio-economic and financial crisis. The state of affairs at the current situation certainly requires our more active and coordinated actions.\nWe welcome the tireless efforts made by the UN Secretary-General, United Nations specialized agencies, foundations and programmes to provide immediate and long-term assistance to member states in tackling the humanitarian and socio-economic repercussion of COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe applaud the commitment and praise the efforts of states to develop anti- COVID vaccine.\nWe very much hope that it will be accessible to all states and the vaccine producer-countries will initiate a supply of certain amount of vaccine as a humanitarian aid to cover the vulnerable groups from other countries, while prioritizing women, children and elderly people.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant impact on the Republic of Tajikistan, which has become a matter of our deep concern.\nWith the view to preventing a spread of disease we today are exerting massive efforts to increase necessary volume of medication and medical equipment and to this end we for the time being are undertaking effectful measures in cooperation with the World Health Organization, countries and development partners.\nPrestigious international organizations assess the consequences of coronavirus spread as an ongoing process, which would definitely adversely impact the global economy development.\nThis situation poses countless unprecedented challenges in front of Tajikistan\u2019s development.\nThe coronavirus outbreak has led to recession in all areas of the national economy, including obstructing investment operations, such as foreign direct investment inflow, domestic and foreign trade, tourism and services, particularly transport sector.\nTajikistan as a mountainous and landlocked country does not possess sufficient amount of oil and gas resources.\nIn the meantime, we are dependent on import of fuel almost in hundred percent, as well as import of other goods and products, including food and pharmaceutical by eighty and ninety per cent accordingly.\nAccording to preliminary estimations, due to a negative impact of external economic factors, a total damage to Tajikistan\u2019s economy this year would amount to more than $2 billion and most likely this number may increase in the future.\nTaking into consideration an ongoing process of the pandemic impact, the Government of Tajikistan along with prevention of a spread of this infectious disease has been exerting efforts to undertake necessary measures aimed at ensuring consistent and sustainable operation of all socioeconomic sectors of the country.\nMr. President,\nIt is crystal clear that advancement of constructive processes is possible only when lasting stability and overall safety are secured.\nIn a par with an unprecedented wave of COVID-19 nowadays expansion of scale and intensity of terrorism and extremism, armed conflicts and wars, transnational organized crime, including trafficking in narcotics and other modern threats and challenges remain alarming.\nTerrorist and extremist groups pose tremendous challenge on national security, seriously jeopardizing stability of the countries and different regions.\nElimination of the menace of terrorism necessitates a clear perception of its motives and the root causes promoting terrorism, as well as common global approach towards the definition of terrorism.\nAlong with this, in our view, it is of particular importance to elaborate new and effective means to a common fight against terrorism, including by the means of the state-of-the-art technology, cooperation and coordination among relevant security authorities of the member states.\nBold and drastic measures commonly undertaken within the international law and avoidance of double standard policy are recognized as yet another important factors in tackling challenges.\nTajikistan is convinced that response to the growing threat of terrorism must be all-embracing and the United Nations should play a key coordinating role in this process.\nTajikistan being located in the frontline of addressing security threats and challenges has made and is determined to continue making an invaluable contribution to countering terrorism and extremism, fighting transnational organized crime, including tackling drug trafficking.\nTo this end, we maintain and foster productive cooperation with our partners and international organizations, in particular with the relevant UN agencies.\nWe have developed and at present are implementing shared initiatives which have already yielded noticeable results.\nCurrently our two National Strategies \u2014 the first on Counter-Terrorism and Extremism and the second on Counter-Narcotics Trafficking are in the final phase of an implementation in our country.\nThe commencement of cooperation with international organizations and regional partner institutions in elaboration of these two Strategy papers for a new period is a clear evidence of our success we have achieved in this direction.\nWe do believe it is necessary to comply with the rules and implement the provisions of the relevant generally accepted treaties and conventions.\nIn this regard, Tajikistan sustains fruitful cooperation with the relevant United Nations agencies and regional organizations, such as the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Collective Security Treaty Organization.\nWe have also established productive bilateral cooperative relationships with our partner countries.\nSuccess in joint concerted actions aiming at prevention and resolution of conflicts, exploration of peaceful ways of addressing crises and confrontations, first and foremost depends on the effective use of preventive diplomacy and mediation.\nAccordingly, it is necessary to strengthen the preventive activity\u2019s dimension of the UN, including to improve its Regional Center for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia.\nTajikistan which has experienced all horrors of the imposed civil war, values and well percepts the importance of an overwhelming protection of peace.\nThis is why Tajikistan hails the United Nations peacekeeping operations and strives to contribute to promote this process at extent possible.\nOur police forces are involved in the UN peacekeeping operations in Darfur, South Sudan and the city of Abyei in the Sudan.\nWe are committed to further continue our cooperation in this area with the relevant United Nations bodies.\nGiven the experience our country gained in countering terrorism, extremism and illegal drug trafficking and with the view to introducing the Tajik peace experience we are determined to nominate for the first time Tajikistan\u2019s candidacy for a non-permanent seat in the UN Security Council for 2028-2029.\nWe very much hope that Tajikistan\u2019s initiative will be encouraged by the member-states and they will give their support to our candidacy.\nTajikistan shares almost 1,400 km. of border with Afghanistan.\nWe therefore give an utmost attention to the military, political and socioeconomic situation in this close and extended neighboring country.\nEscalation of alarming situation in this country urges the international community to undertake extra measures to coordinate actions in the fight against terrorism, coping with drug manufacturing and trafficking in narcotics, likewise deliver timely assistance to the Government and the people of Afghanistan.\nAs we stated time and again, the Afghan case has no military solution and Tajikistan indeed welcomes the peace-building negotiation processes and support any approach aimed at addressing political crisis in this country.\nThe destiny and the future of Afghanistan should be first and foremost led and owned by Afghan people and our belief is firm that stabilization of the situation in this country can be achieved only through Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan- controlled peacebuilding process.\nTajikistan this year is presiding over \u201cThe Heart of Asia - Istanbul Process\u201d and during our presidency we will strive to increase a genuine efficiency of this platform.\nTo this day Tajikistan has contributed to the implementation of several joint regional projects on Afghanistan.\nWe built power transmission lines and constructed six transboundary bridges.\nWe stand ready to further advance cooperation which would help active involvement of Afghanistan into the regional integration processes and facilitate its socio-economic recovery.\nFurther implementation of projects on highway connectivity between the two countries\u2019 and construction of power transmission lines, particularly CASA-1000 jointly with other countries of the region, professional training of Afghan specialists in different sectors are among the areas of cooperation that we sustain and are committed to promote.\nMr. President,\nWe have ten years left until the end of the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe international community has made a significant progress in this direction over the past five years.\nHowever, the economic and financial indicators of the countries and severe negative consequences of COVID-19 call into question a timely implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly in developing countries.\nThe repercussion of the COVID-19 will also negatively affect our country, which is one of the proactive members of the global community in an implementation of the 2030 Agenda.\nI would like to recall that Tajikistan was one of the first countries to adopt its 2030 National Development Strategy in line with the 2030 Agenda.\nOur country presented its National Voluntary Report back in 2017 and introduced its progress it has achieved towards the Sustainable Development Goals.\nWe are hopeful that the Decade of Action to deliver the Global Goals will help to seek ways of sustainable solutions to such pressing global challenges, as climate change, poverty, gender inequality and financing.\nWe should give an utmost importance to climate change challenges, which in this process pose serious hardships to all nations, including to Tajikistan.\nOver the past sixty years, the average annual temperature in Tajikistan has increased by one degree.\nIt has resulted in increased number of days with heavy precipitations and intensity of natural hydro-meteorological phenomena, which have year after year been affecting all countries throughout the world.\nTajikistan with 93 per cent of its territory covered by mountains, bears losses equal to hundreds of millions of dollars annually as a result of water-related disasters.\nSuch natural disasters often cause casualties.\nThe areas of glaciers located in our country which are essential for all Central Asia have been noticeably reduced over the recent decades.\nOne thousand out of thirteen thousand glaciers located in Tajikistan mountains have melted away so far.\nThis happens although up to sixty percent of Central Asia\u2019s water resources is accumulated on the territory of Tajikistan.\nThis year, due to low precipitations in the winter we have seen a significant decline in water stock in the region\u2019s rivers, which in turn led to low-water season during the irrigation and caused a severe drought.\nThis situation causes a negative impact on the quantity and a quality of safe drinking water, as well as water-related sectors, particularly agriculture and energy.\nIn connection with this circumstance, the countries of the region are concerned with the shifts in the hydrological cycle.\nWe in this connection would like to call on the United Nations and other international and regional organizations to support Tajikistan with the expedition of glaciers in Central Asia.\nTajikistan generates ninety nine percent of its electricity in hydro-electric power stations, that is from renewable \u2018green\u2019 energy sources.\nOur country is among the less carbon dioxide emitters in the world.\nIn this context, I wish to once again offer the following proposals towards seeking the ways of addressing the climate change, which I had previously introduced in other international fora:\n1.\tEncouragement of a widespread use of renewable energy sources, which would facilitate a friendly environment for the \u201cgreen\u201d economy development.\n2.\tComprehensive support by donor countries and international and regional financial institutions in an implementation of national strategies and programs for adaptation to climate change.\n3.\tReinforce regular monitoring of the generation of water resources, especially glaciers.\n4.\tStrengthen international cooperation on protection of water resources and implementation of Tajikistan\u2019s proposal to establish The International Glacier Preservation Fund.\n5.\tThe delivery of comprehensive financial and technical assistance by developed countries and international organizations to developing and least developed countries to monitor and preserve glaciers and other sources of water.\nWe hope that our international partners will support further steps Tajikistan undertakes forward in these areas.\nMr. President,\nThe United Nations acknowledged Tajikistan as an initiator and champion country in advancing water agenda.\nOur country is the author of majority of the United Nations\u2019 initiatives and resolutions on water, including \u201cThe International Decade for Action \u201cWater for Sustainable Development\u201d 2018 - 2028\u201d.\nOwing to support of the UN member states we have been able to revive and strengthen the global water agenda over the past decades.\nTajikistan\u2019s Resolution entitled \u201cComprehensive Mid-Term Review of the International Decade for Action \u201cWater for Sustainable Development\u201d 2018-2028 which had been adopted in 2018 had further enriched the global water agenda.\nThe Resolution along with other important goals and objectives, calls for convening the United\nNations Conference on a Comprehensive Mid-Term Review of the International Decade for Action \u201cWater for Sustainable Development\u201d, 2018-2028 in New York on March 2023.\nThis event is valued as an important initiative in terms of support towards an implementation of the Decade and conduct of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.\nIt is worth recalling that the last UN Conference on Water was held yet in 1977 in Mar de Plata, Argentina.\nIt means that the United Nations will host the Water Conference after 46 years.\nWe can confidently claim that the United Nations member states, UN specialized agencies and other organizations have been demonstrating a growing interest and utmost attention to the Decade for Action \u201cWater for Sustainable Development\u201d while some nations have already expressed their willingness to host regional preparatory meetings.\nRegretfully, spread ofCOVID-19 affected their plans and most of the scheduled events have been postponed.\nI hope that after the victory over the coronavirus pandemic, the stakeholder countries, along with Tajikistan, will be able to take full advantage of the opportunities and convene events they have scheduled.\nIn conclusion, I would like to draw the attention of all United Nations member states to the draft Resolution proposed by Tajikistan on the UN Conference for a Comprehensive Mid-Term Review of the Implementation of the International Decade for Action \u201cWater for Sustainable Development\u201d, 2018-2028.\nIt has been decided to review this Resolution at the UN General Assembly Session.\nI would like to encourage all distinguished delegates to support our initiative, like they have been so generous in supporting our previous Resolutions.\nThank you for your kind attention!"

        "file_text": "Mr President\nSecretary-General\nDistinguished Delegates\nHappy 75th anniversary\nCollectively, the member states of these United Nations are failing in our responsibility to our one planet and in our duty to the peoples, of our one world.\nAt each of the past 74 sessions of this General Assembly, many pledges have been made, to make the international community less inequitable; many commitments have been given to lift-up the poor and the vulnerable; and many declarations have been issued to end the scourge of war.\nYet, in the 74 years that have passed since the first session of this General Assembly, on 10 January 1946, the world has experienced only brief efforts to deliver these pledges, commitments, and declarations.\nThose efforts were vital.\nThey made a difference.\nWith each of them, mankind made some progress on the path to human equality, environmental safety, and global security.\nBut, despite them, the benefits of wider inclusive international cooperation are now being sacrificed by the powerful, on the altar of attaining their narrower exclusive national advantage.\nNever before, has the world had such ample technical and financial resources to address the challenges facing all mankind, including the ravages of Climate Change, pandemics, food security, malnutrition, hunger and poverty.\nThe problem is, that these resources are concentrated in the Capitals of a few nations, which have retreated from contributing to meet those challenges and to overcome them for the good of all humanity.\nAs this Assembly is held, developing countries \u2014 particularly small states \u2014 are trapped, in a downward spiral of economic decline and environmental degradation which they did not create, and over which they have no control.\nThere are no trends identifiable today, no programmes, or policies that offer hope of narrowing the gap between rich and poor, let alone to bridge it.\nWhat the world is witnessing, is a march by the richest nations away from any obligations to global good.\nThe drums of nationalism are drowning out the cries for global solidarity without which, the world\u2019s peace, progress and prosperity will never be assured, nor will the principles upon which the United Nations organization was founded, ever be satisfied.\nThis is not the future we want. That is not the future we deserve.\nIf ever there was a time for the nations of the world to jointly confront threats to all of them \u2014 the time is now.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought that realization directly in the face of all our nations.\nIt is global in its sweep and universal in its dangers.\nNot only has it visited a public health emergency on each nation; it has wreaked economic havoc in all of them.\nThe perils of the pandemic loom large across the globe, jumping across the divides of national borders and defying the belief that rich nations can survive, while poorer nations succumb.\nThe pandemic has added to the dangers of Climate Change which is, as pernicious as the COVID-19 pandemic in its reach, and insidious in its impact.\nThe poor and the vulnerable are already the first to suffer from the economic impact of COVID-19 and Climate Change, but the rich have not been spared.\nAnd narrow nationalist policies that undermine international cooperation will make matters worse, not better.\nEvery nation of the world is a marketplace for others.\nThe chain of supply and sales are global.\nCountries are now inextricably interlinked for tourism and business by air and sea transportation, and also, by the goods and services we each buy and supply, including in science and technology.\nNo nation, however wealthy, can survive if its markets dwindle and its sources of supply decline.\nWe are all inter-dependent, however large or small.\nThe unity of human needs, requires a functional multilateral system that respects the democratic principles of sovereignty, participation and consent; rejecting the bullying doctrine of exclusion, imposition and abuse of economic sanctions.\nYet, even though the countries of the Caribbean are among the greatest victims of the profligacy of others, in relation to the creation of Climate Change and its effects; and, although our economies are among the worst impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, in whose creation we played no part; we are denied a voice in international decision-making and we are subjected unfairly to the will of others.\nThe Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) is forecasting that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the Caribbean will contract by 6.9 per cent in 2020, because of the effects of COVID-19 on our economies.\nThis is eroding the gains made by my own country, Antigua and Barbuda where, in January of this year, we were set to achieve over 6.2 per cent growth, in addition to an average growth rate of 5 per cent in the previous six years.\nAs a country, highly dependent on tourism, the closure of borders, the cessation of cruise tourism and the limits on aviation, effectively devastated our economy overnight, resulting not only in serious loss of revenues, but also in sudden and significant loss of jobs.\nGovernments have had to expend enormous resources, spending as high as, 8 per cent of GDP, to mitigate the impact of the public health crisis, amid this extraordinary decline in revenues and foreign exchange.\nIn the case of my own small country, we have been denied loans from the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) because of the skewed per capita income criterion, applied by their policy-making Boards.\nThe result has been that, apart from a line of credit from the Inter-American\nDevelopment Bank, that is yet to be consummated, Antigua and Barbuda has received not one cent from the International Financial Institutions, to help us meet the enormous challenges that have brought much larger countries to their knees.\nIn our own case, the approach of the Paris Club of official debt holders has been particularly callous; absolutely insensitive during this unprecedented global pandemic.\nThe Paris Club has not found it possible to agree to suspension of debt payments, debt rescheduling, or debt forgiveness, to allow countries like mine an opportunity to cope with the extraordinary challenges confronting us and in which we played no part in creating.\nAmidst, the circumstances of dwindled revenues and extraordinary expenses, the Paris Club is demanding repayment of decades old delinquent loans that simply cannot be repaid at this time.\nWhat is worse, with no sympathy for the dire conditions we face, the Paris Club blocked the IMF from considering financial assistance and debt service relief, provided to many others, unless we subject ourselves to a programme that would lead to an increased debt service burden and even more austere conditions for our people than presently exists.\nThat, we cannot do and certainly will not entertain.\nAs our economy weakens, with an insufficient response by the international community for debt rescheduling and access to concessional financing, unemployment and poverty are growing.\nNonetheless, the people of my country are moving on with resilience, bravely and resolutely.\nWe reaffirm our commitment to multilateralism, and we are doing our part in tackling COVID-19 within our boundaries and by contributing to multilateral action.\nI am proud that, despite all the challenges with which we were confronted, Antigua and Barbuda has successfully managed the COVID-19 pandemic, by quickly detecting and treating infected persons and through effective contact tracing to prevent community spread.\nAntigua and Barbuda has recorded only three deaths since the pandemic started.\nPresently, we have just one active laboratory confirmed case of COVID-19 infection, despite re-opening our borders on June 1st, to daily commercial flights from North America and Europe, in an attempt to earn some revenues from the vital tourism sector to protect lives and livelihoods.\nMy Government has also invested in modern medical facilities, including a well-equipped Infectious Diseases Centre, manned by trained, qualified and experienced personnel.\nIn addition, we have expanded and upgraded our health facilities to three beds per 1,000 of population and improved our tertiary health care services.\nAll of this has been achieved despite inadequate assistance from the International Financial Institutions, to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our economy.\nIf this situation continues without an appropriate response from the international community, many countries, like mine, will be unable to pay existing debt and will not qualify for new borrowings.\nEven if, these countries all end up in IMF programmes to give them short-term relief, unless there is suspension of debt payments, debt forgiveness and debt rescheduling, they will not recover their economies; they will certainly not achieve the UN sustainable development goals, and their debt stock will be enlarged by the compound interest that will result from unpaid debts.\nUnfortunately, the economic development they have so far achieved will be reversed with little prospect of recovery.\nThis is not the world we want; proactive financial intervention by the IFI\u2019s is needed now, not tomorrow; tomorrow\u2019s intervention may be too late.\nAs Alicia Barcena, the Executive Secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean has pointed out:\n\u201cThe leaders of the G20 should be in favour of multilateral organizations making loans at favourable interest rates and alleviating the debt of countries that are highly indebted, deferring it or forgiving it. If that does not occur, the payments will be impossible and fiscal space will be compromised. Exceptional measures are required to confront an unprecedented crisis. There will be no progress without international cooperation and solidarity.\u201d\nThis is a statement we endorse in its entirety. The socio-economic sustainability of the region will be compromised without a proactive debt suspension and restructuring and ultimately debt relief.\nDistinguished delegates, the future we should all want requires the establishment of a new era of multilateralism, based on the premise that the life of every human being matters.\nAnd that, in living their lives, every human being should be given the opportunity to prosper \u2014 free from intimidation, hunger, malnutrition, disease and war.\nOur nations \u2014 united \u2014 should affirm their commitment to that goal and work diligently to achieve it.\nThat is the United Nations we need.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nOn behalf of my Government and people, may I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your election as President of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. Your wealth of experience will serve this organization well, as you lead us through our agenda, particularly during these unprecedented and challenging times, as the world navigates its way through the global pandemic caused by COVID-19. Let me assure you of Solomon Islands support and cooperation during your tenure in office.\nLet me also use this occasion to commend your predecessor, His Excellency Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, for his excellent leadership of the General Assembly over the past session. I highly commend his efforts in ensuring the work of the assembly progressed in spite of the restrictions faced by the United Nations Secretariat and member states missions. I wish him every success in his future endeavors.\nMr. President\nAt the outset, allow me, on behalf of the government and people of the Solomon Islands, offer sincerest condolences to all who have lost loved ones to the coronavirus. We stand in solidarity with you all, during these sad times.\nNever before has there been a time when the collective action of all UN member states is so greatly needed then right now, a time when the world faces the global, deadly pandemic of COVID-19.\nThe theme you have chosen for the 75th session renders us this timely opportunity to once again, turn our eyes towards the strengths of multilateralism to address the multiple and complex challenges that our world faces today.\nMr. President,\nIn the space of a few months, COVID-19 has resulted in more than 30 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, including over 900,000 deaths, according to the latest official World Health Organization statistics. In the health sector the virus remains a novelty to many of our scientific and medical professionals worldwide and as such, its long-term health repercussions to those who have recovered from it are either unknown or poorly understood.\nI am pleased to inform the Assembly that Solomon Islands remains one of the 12 COVID-19 free countries without a reported case. Nine other Pacific Small Islands Developing States share the COVID-19 free status.\nHowever, we have not remained complacent. My government has responded to the pandemic by undertaking the following steps. Firstly, a COVID-19 Oversight Committee comprising of all relevant government agencies was quickly established to coordinate the Government\u2019s response to the pandemic. Furthermore, resources were swiftly mobilized to address gaps within our healthcare system and secure entry points on our borders. On the economic front my Government has created a stimulus package to cushion the negative impacts that the virus has and will continue to impose on our fragile economy.\nThe public have been kept informed about the virus through talk back shows with the COVID-19 Oversight Committee. I also informed our public through my weekly address to the nation which is broadcasted live on air and televised. This is to ensure that our people are kept informed on the steps the Government is undertaking to protect the country. My Government continues to focus on building the necessary health infrastructure within our hospitals in preparation to accommodate any persons that may contract the virus.\nIn addition, we also have in-country testing capacity. This was only possible through the assistance of People\u2019s Republic of China and Australia, which if I may add is a manifestation of our theme. That said, we have put in place standard operating procedures for different sectors to guide us in dealing with this global pandemic. Our objective is two-fold. Our number one priority is to protect our country by keeping the virus from breaching our borders. The second objective is to keep our economy afloat. We are confident that should the virus breach our borders we can contain and manage it at our quarantine stations.\nSo far 11 repatriation flights have been undertaken. More than 1000 people have entered our borders, 80 per cent of whom are repatriated nationals and 20 per cent foreign nationals. We have scheduled more flights to repatriate more of our nationals abroad.\nCOVID-19 has brought Solomon Islands closer with its partners. We have made new friends, the latest being \u201cPhilippines Red Cross\u201d, who are doing a fantastic work in testing and looking after our students in Manila. We are grateful to the excellent work the Red Cross continue to do for our nationals.\nI take this time to thank all host countries and transit countries for their goodwill and understanding in accommodating our citizens as they wait to be repatriated. I also wish to express heartfelt thanks to our development partners including, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, the Peoples Republic of China, the United Arab Emirates, Asian Development Bank, World Bank, United Nations agencies and in particular, the World Health Organization, and our regional institutions for your kind assistance and generosity, through financial support and timely donations of medical equipment for our health sector. Your unwavering support is deeply appreciated and will continue to be needed as we continue in our efforts to combat the spread of the virus.\nCOVID-19 has closed borders and negatively impacted on the global economy. Solomon Islands is no exception, we are going through a difficult period, however, we have launched an Economic Stimulus Package to reset and boost our economy. Let me thank all our partners who have supported our economic initiative.\nWe have also launched the Development Bank of Solomon Islands which aims to provide sustainable financial services targeting development in the rural areas, especially to small and medium enterprises that primarily engages in commerce and industries.\nMr. President,\nWhilst dealing with a pandemic of global proportions, Solomon Islands continues to battle with the incremental effects of climate change and the negative impacts that it has on the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of Solomon Islanders. Climate Change has resulted in changing weather patterns that have caused anomaly weather events of epic proportions. Additionally, climate change has resulted in warming global temperatures which are melting the ice caps and causing sea levels to rise. Both sea level rise and abnormal weather events have wreaked havoc on our infrastructure and homes not to mention threatening our food security and lives. Just earlier this year, we experienced the traumatic effects of Tropical Cyclone Harold. Allow me to thank our development partners who stepped in to assist us during this disaster.\nSolomon Islands for its part, remains committed to reducing our carbon footprint and doubling on our nationally determined contributions through our ongoing work on the Tina Hydropower project. This 15-megawatt hydropower project will reduce our reliance on fossil fuels by 70 per cent. Despite the challenges brought about by COVID-19, our efforts to have the project commissioned by 2024 remains on track and we continue to call on development partners to remain with us on this steady trajectory.\nI wish to remind us all, that in our collective efforts to combat the coronavirus, we must not lose sight of the need to address ongoing challenges brought about by climate change. I once again reiterate my Government\u2019s call for more action by those with a greater means of implementation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, I call on all states to set ambitious nationally determined contributions. Let us adhere to what the science is telling us and strive to maintain the global temperature increase below 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nMr. President,\nAs a large ocean state with an area of 1.5 million square kilometres, the conservation and preservation of the Ocean and its resources remains a priority for Solomon Islands. The lives of our people and the economy of our country remains deeply connected to the ocean. The Solomon Islands tuna industry generates around $60 million in revenue on an annual basis for the economy and provides employment for 2,000 Solomon Islanders. Sadly, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing within our maritime jurisdiction remains a threat to our tuna resources. Almost $150 million worth of direct economic value to small island developing states including Solomon Islands is lost as a result of IUU in the Pacific. I call on distant water fishing nations to reduce the incidences of IUU in our waters.\nOn matters pertaining to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, my Government remain committed to negotiating a legally binding instrument on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. My Government looks forward to an Agreement that is fair, comprehensive and provides the capacity building for small island developing states such as Solomon Islands to fully implement it. We note the challenges that COVID-19 has posed on the ability of states to conclude the negotiations in 2020, however, we must not lose this momentum. We must continue to strive to complete negotiations by the earliest possible date.\nEnsuring sovereignty over our maritime zones remains important to my government. We are actively working towards the completion of the delimitation of all our maritime zones and have only one remaining maritime boundary left to conclude. In this regard, my Government welcomes the work that is being undertaken by the International Law Commission on the questions of sea level rise and sovereignty. It is my government\u2019s position that once national maritime zones are deposited with the United Nations, they should not be subject to change despite sea level rise. Solomon Islands is an Ocean State, the Country\u2019s sovereign territory should not change due to the effects of climate change and sea level rise.\nMr. President,\nAt a time when the world is facing unprecedented challenges exacerbated by COVID 19, it is more important than ever, that the world remains united in its efforts to bring peace and unity among all peoples regardless of race, gender and religion. As a post conflict country our people keep striving to maintain unity within our diversity. It is for this very reason that my Government is proud to have contributed 12 police officers to the United Nations African Mission in Darfur, Sudan. We stand ready to deploy more officers for UN peacekeeping duties in other UN peacekeeping missions especially during these critical times.\nMr. President,\nGraduation from the category of Least Developing Countries is an important milestone in the development trajectory of a developing country. Solomon Islands is in its transition phase of the graduation and is scheduled to graduate by 2024. However, both times that Solomon Islands underwent the triennial review, it did not pass the vulnerability criterion. Our vulnerability has become glaringly obvious now that COVID-19 has exacerbated the preexisting challenges faced by Solomon Islands and made the pathway towards sustainable graduation and smooth transition extremely difficult.\nI welcome the Committee on Development Policy\u2019s intention to factor, the impacts of COVID-19 on all sectors during the next triennial review in 2021. I further encourage them to work closely with us to ensure that their next report paints the true picture of Solomon Islands development path as we continue to navigate our transition roadmap in these uncertain and challenging times.\nMr. President,\nSolomon Islands presented its first ever Voluntary National Review Report on the implementation of Agenda 2030 in July this year. Despite the technological challenges, we were able to highlight some of the achievements we have made to date. Solomon Islands continues to see an increase in number of children enrolled in the formal education system. Secondly, we are proud to have established a National Financing Framework for Development which underpins the financing of the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe report also highlighted the challenges we face in terms of our health sector and particularly on our rates of non-communicable disease cases. Seven out of ten deaths in Solomon Islands are caused by non-communicable diseases. It remains the largest single cause of death in the country.\nWe are seeing increasing numbers of undernourished children and over nourished adults. In addition to this, the report also highlighted the vulnerability of our economy to external shocks and natural disasters. These coupled with the impacts of COVID 19 will continue to affect Solomon Islands for the foreseeable future.\nSolomon Islands believes in the importance of Agenda 2030, the Istanbul Program of Action and the SAMOA Pathway in charting the course for sustainable development. We have factored these into our national development strategy as the path forward for a sustainable future for our people. I urge all development partners to remain committed to working with us to achieve our aim of sustainable development.\nMr. President,\nSolomon Islands recognizes the contributions that our frontline health workers make in the fight against COVID-19. In this regard, allow me to offer my deep thanks to Cuba for the training of our medical students. More than eighty Solomon Islands medical doctors having graduated from Cuban medical schools and a further eight more have graduated this year. We note with concern the 59-year-old economic embargo imposed on Cuba remains in place and we reiterate the call for the lifting of the embargo within the spirit and purposes of the United Nations Charter.\nFinally, Mr. President,\nAllow me to conclude by commending you on the theme for this year\u2019s General Assembly session. It could not have come at a more critical time, when we find ourselves facing the deadliest pandemic to affect our modern world in the most horrendous of ways. So many lives have been tragically lost and many continue to be affected by its ongoing onslaught. May we take the time to pause and reflect, on how this virus has changed our lives and look at ways we can collaborate together to alleviate its impacts.\nAs we continue to confront the problems that our world faces; from climate change, to the deteriorating health of our planet to the coronavirus; we must remember that they can only be addressed through collective action by each and every one of us. As the old African proverb says \u2018if you wish to go fast, go alone. If you wish to go far, go together\u2019. Now is the time for us to act collectively to address the needs of everyone including the most vulnerable among us! Together we can and together we will go far.\nI thank you Mr. President."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nAt the outset, I would like to express our profound appreciation to the President of the seventy \u2014 fourth session of the General Assembly, Mr. Muhammad-Bande, for his outstanding leadership during these unprecedented times of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nI would also like to congratulate the newly elected President of the General Assembly of the seventy-fifth session, Mr. Volkan Bozkir and wish every success in the exercise of his duties, in a fair and transparent manner.\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nThe Republic of Cyprus fully endorses the theme chosen for this landmark session marking the seventy-fifth anniversary year of the United Nations.\nA theme which is as relevant as ever, since there are explicit references, and I quote: \u201cThe future we want, the UN we need: Reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism....\u201d\nWe are all witnessing tendencies of unilateralism or revival of nationalistic discourse which create a legitimacy deficit that casts doubt on the overall credibility and undermine the effectiveness of the Organization.\nAt the same time, we are also witnessing global crises like the pandemic, civil conflicts, forced migration, religious fundamentalism, hunger and poverty, violent extremism, destruction of cultural heritage.\nAnd we have to be honest: It is for these exact reasons that there is disappointment and skepticism about the effectiveness of multilateralism, as people voice their frustration that international institutions are out of touch, incapable or unwilling to deliver.\nWe should rise to meet our shared responsibilities through collective leadership, reaffirm our commitment and restore the premises underlining effective multilateralism, joint responsibility and greater solidarity.\nTo this end, the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations provides an opportunity for the Organization to reclaim its inherent role and reinvigorate its tools to uphold universal values.\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nAmid these extraordinary times, the pandemic has underscored the world\u2019s vulnerability and fragilities, attesting that concerted efforts are humanity\u2019s only hope and a destined necessity.\nAs eloquently put by the Secretary General: \u201cPreventing the further spread of COVID-19 is a shared responsibility for us all. We are in this together, no country can do it alone\u201d.\nPertinent to the above, I have to admit that I, and I believe all of us, remain extremely concerned as regards the worrying upward trend of new coronovirus cases and deaths we are currently witnessing globally.\nHence, I believe that the only way forward in order to protect the most vulnerable groups of peoples is to collectively demonstrate solidarity, through supporting those countries whose health systems are in need.\nA solidarity which should also include sharing the vaccine for COVID-19 in an equitable and reciprocate manner once is being developed.\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nIn order to be consistent with what I have mentioned as regards the value of multilateralism and the challenges that we are facing, I will concentrate my intervention in a particular geographic region being amongst the most afflicted ones, the Middle East.\nWe are all concerned by Turkey\u2019s interventions which affect the territorial integrity and destabilize Libya, Syria and Iraq, and we are also equally worried of the violations by the said country of the sovereign rights of both Greece and Cyprus.\nThe combination of the above-mentioned has created a climate of increasing instability, with negative repercussions, not only to the region but beyond.\nCyprus, despite its small size, acts as a facilitator for synergies, and cooperation by promoting a web of partnerships, including trilateral and multilateral schemes along with Greece, with Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Palestine and Armenia.\nFounded on the principles of international law and good neighborly relations, these partnerships are neither directed against any third country nor do they exclude any country which shares our vision of establishing conditions of lasting peace and stability in our region.\nUnfortunately, against this background and the latest positive developments of gradually restoring relations between Israel and Arab countries, Turkey consistently and consciously escalates tensions by enforcing its expansionist plans through the use of force.\nPlease allow me to avoid expanding on Turkey\u2019s well-known behavior in the aforesaid countries and concentrate on its stance and unilateral actions vis-a-vis my own country.\nNeedless to remind that Cyprus and its people still suffer from the 1974 illegal military invasion, the consequent military occupation of 37 per cent of our country and the forcible displacement of 40 per cent of its population.\nSince then, despite the constructive engagement of both mine and my predecessors towards reaching a just and viable settlement, due to Turkey\u2019s intransigent stance and irrational demands, Cyprus remains the last European divided country.\nThe last effort towards reaching a settlement took place in 2017, following the initiative of the UN Secretary-General to convene a multilateral Conference on Cyprus at Crans Montana.\nDuring the Conference, the Secretary-General identified a framework of six elements that should be discussed interdependently and comprehensively, including the Chapter of Security and Guarantees, in order to reach a strategic agreement that would pave the way forward for a comprehensive settlement.\nUnfortunately, despite our positive engagement and the submission of credible and realistic written proposals, the negotiations were unsuccessful due to Turkey\u2019s inflexible stance and insistence on maintaining the anachronistic Treaty of Guarantee and the right of intervention, as well as a permanent presence of troops.\nAn approach which run contrary to our capacity as an EU Member-State and the explicit remarks of the UN Secretary-General of 4 June 2017, following his meeting with the leaders of the two communities, that:\n\u201cProgress in the Chapter of Security and Guarantees is an essential\nelement in reaching an overall agreement and in building trust between the\ntwo communities in relation to their future security\u201d.\nEver since, and despite our disappointment, we have repeatedly conveyed our commitment to immediately resume direct talks for a settlement of the Cyprus problem from where they were left off at Crans Montana.\nIn this regard, I wish to welcome the intention of the UN Secretary-General to personally engage to efforts in resuming the negotiating process after the completion of the internal political procedures within the Turkish Cypriot community.\nOn my behalf, I wish to reiterate our unwavering position:\nWe remain committed to immediately resume the peace process, in line with the relevant joint understanding reached with the UN Secretary-General and the Turkish Cypriot leader on November 25, 2019, which sets the principles for the resumption of a new round of negotiations.\nAt the same time, and I have to be clear on this issue, as this is a fundamental prerequisite of every peace process:\nFor the talks to resume with realistic prospects for success, it is imperative to create an environment that will be conducive for constructive and good faith negotiations, on an equal footing and not under conditions of intimidation and threats.\nAnd I have made this reference since, in addition to Turkey\u2019s continuous occupation of our country, we are currently witnessing a series of provocative actions which:\nRun contrary to international law, the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions and the UN Convention on the law of the Sea either through illegal drillings in our Exclusive Economic Zone or by threats for the imminent opening of the fenced city of Varosha under Turkish military control.\nMr. President, Excellencies,\nI expected, following the recent statement of the UN Secretary-General of his intention to resume negotiations, that Turkey would respond in a positive way.\nHowever, it is with deep regret that we were informed of the reaction of Turkey, through public statements of his Minister of Foreign Affairs who argued that their aspiration and aim is to establish or impose a two-state solution or a confederal system of Governance.\nMy regret grew bigger after the recent statements by the President of Turkey, Mr. Erdogan, during his address at the UN General Debate.\nWhat is most disappointing is the futile effort of Mr. Erdogan, in full defiance of historic truths, to impress that tensions in the Middle East are due to the unilateral actions undertaken by Greeks and Greek Cypriots.\nI would never have expected that a country \u2014 which has been condemned repeatedly by a plethora of UN Resolutions, decisions of the Security Council, as well as of the European Court of Human Rights for its illegal invasion and occupation of 37 per cent of our country, \u2014 would allege that, and I quote: \u201cBehind the tension existing in the Eastern Mediterranean for a while, there are countries acting with the understanding of the \u201cwinner takes it all\u201d.\nAnd I wonder:\nWhich country uses might in order to \u201ctake it all?\nWhich country prefers a power-based interstate conduct rather than a rules- based one?\nHow contradictory, is the reference of Mr. Erdogan that: \u201cWe do not have designs on anyone else\u2019s right, remedy and legitimate interest neither in the Eastern Mediterranean nor in any other region\u201d.\nAnd I wonder:\nWhich country invaded and still occupies Cyprus;\nWhich country invaded Syria;\nWhich country military intervened in Libya;\nWhich country violates the sovereign rights of Greece;\nWhich country intervenes in the internal affairs of Iraq?\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nWhat is even more paradox as regards Mr. Erdogan\u2019s approach is his comment that \u201cwe cannot turn a blind eye on the violations of our country and the Turkish Cypriots and the fact that our interests are being ignored\u201d.\nAnd I wonder, yet again:\nWhose interests are being ignored when Turkey\u2019s claims, limit the exclusive Economic Zone of Cyprus by 44 per cent at the expense of both Greek and Turkish Cypriots?\nWhose interests are being ignored when Turkey:\nChooses to disregard the convergences reached between the leaders of the two communities both in 2011 and 2015 which provide that:\n(a)\tFederal Cyprus will continue being a contracting party to the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, and;\n(b)\tAny revenues accrued from the exploitation of the State\u2019s natural resources will be allocated to the federal government.\nAnd I wish to remind that these convergences were never challenged by Turkey or the Turkish Cypriot side.\nIt is for this exact reason that the issue of hydrocarbons was neither raised during the intense negotiating period between 2011 to 2017 nor was part of one of the elements of the framework of the UN Secretary-General as presented at Crans Montana.\nAt the same time, Turkey also disregards the fact that the Republic of Cyprus has established a National Sovereign Fund which safeguards the interests of Greek and Turkish Cypriots from any revenues accrued from the exploitation of hydrocarbon deposits.\nMoreover, Turkey fails to acknowledge my proposal for establishing an escrow account to the benefit of the Turkish Cypriot community, to which any revenues from the exploitation of hydrocarbons would be deposited, based on the population proportion of the constituent states.\nAnd if Turkey will recognize the sovereign rights of the Republic of Cyprus within its Exclusive Economic Zone, then the said revenues might be released to the benefit of the Turkish Cypriot community, even prior to the solution of the Cyprus Problem.\nTherefore, as proven by the aforesaid, Turkey\u2019s assertions that its illegal actions aim at protecting the rights of the Turkish Cypriots are false and invalid, as false and invalid are also its claims that the Republic of Cyprus violates the rights of Turkey.\nHowever, what I would like to welcome is the reference of Mr. Erdogan, and I, yet again, quote: \u201cOur priority is to settle disputes in a sincere dialogue, based on international law and on an equitable basis\u201d.\nIf Mr. Erdogan truly adheres to the above-mentioned and if he sincerely believes that Turkey\u2019s actions against the Republic of Cyprus are compatible with international law, then why doesn\u2019t he accept our proposal for a sincere bilateral dialogue or to refer the whole issue to the International Court of Justice?\nInternational law cannot be applied unilaterally, according to one\u2019s whims.\nWouldn\u2019t be to the best benefit of everyone to settle our differences in accordance with international practices?\nOn my behalf I wish to repeat once more that I am ready to engage in a constructive dialogue and/or to abide by any judgement of the International Court.\nExcellencies,\nThe blame-game method is always used by those who bear the responsibility of not reaching a solution to problems or disputes they themselves created.\nThis is exactly what Mr. Erdogan attempted to do by accusing our side, that: \u201cThe only obstacle to a solution is the uncompromising, unjust and spoiled approach of the Greek Cypriot side\u201d.\nFrom what I have already mentioned it is evident as to which side, through the military invasion and its illegal actions thereafter, aims to permanently divide the Republic of Cyprus.\nThe numerous UN Resolutions, the decisions of the Security Council and the judgements of the European Court of Human Rights, speak by themselves.\nAt the same time, I am wondering:\nIs it uncompromising to aspire establishing an independent and sovereign State, without any foreign guarantees, any right of intervention by a foreign country and free from the presence of occupation troops?\nWhich other of the 193 UN member states is under Guarantees by a third country?\nIs it unjust to advocate establishing a normal State in which all decisions will be taken only by its citizens, free from foreign dependencies?\nIs it uncompromising to envision establishing a robust system of security, based on the Charter of the UN and the Treaties of the EU and the Council of Europe?\nDoes any constitution of a Federal State provide that for every decision at a Federal Level at least one positive vote by one constituent member is required? When especially the constituent member is controlled by a third country?\nDistinguished Friends,\nI posed this argument, having in mind:\na)\tThe fact that the Turkish implanted settlers might now outnumber Turkish Cypriots, and;\nb)\tTurkey\u2019s insistence of maintaining the Treaty of Guarantee, the right of intervention and the permanent presence of Turkish troops.\nIf President Erdogan considers that what he demands for the Turkish Cypriots is compromising and just, then why doesn\u2019t he grant the same rights to the Kurds, bearing in mind that their population proportion is close to the population proportion of the Turkish Cypriots?\nExcellencies,\nI have mentioned just some of Turkey\u2019s demands, preconditions, and ongoing illegal actions in Cyprus.\nI do not want to expand on numerous other absurd claims or activities which do not abide to the notion of reaching a viable and functional settlement, in line with international law and our capacity as an EU member-state.\nWhat I would like to repeat is that, as a European country and in full respect to the values and principles of the EU and the UN, our intention has never been or will never be to deprive our Turkish Cypriot compatriots from their legitimate rights, in accordance with the EU acquis and the UN Charter.\nI do believe, provided that there no foreign interreferences, that there is common ground between the two communities to reach a settlement that will fulfill the vision of our people to live in a European country, truly independent and sovereign.\nA country, free from foreign troops and rights of intervention, ensuring conditions of stability for a safe, prosperous and peaceful future.\nA settlement with neither winners nor losers, in full respect of the sensitivities and concerns of both communities.\nFor a State truly led by Cypriots and not for a State led by foreigners. The era of colonization is well beyond us.\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nIn concluding, I wish to once more reiterate that strengthening our commitment to multilateralism and international cooperation, which underpins the UN Charter, is fundamental to supporting the three UN pillars: peace and security, development and human rights.\nTo this end, I would like to echo one of the most inspiring and hopeful mantras of the last session: \u201cWe remain united in our shared humanity and in giving peace a chance.\u201d\nThank You."

        "file_text": "Mr. President of the General Assembly\nMr. Secretary-General of the United Nations\nI would like to extend my warm congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency of the 75th regular session of the United Nations General Assembly.\nI also wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Tijjani Muhammad Bande, for the work carried out during the 74th General Assembly.\nI would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Antonio Guterres, Secretary- General of the United Nations, for his perseverance in seeking solutions to the various challenges facing the international community.\nMr. President,\nThe world is currently facing an unprecedented health crisis that is serving to emphasize the glaring gaps between the health systems of developed and developing countries in terms of their capacity to respond to major pandemics.\nSuch a situation calls on bilateral and multilateral actors to implement appropriate measures in the face of this pandemic, which is seriously affecting humanity\u2019s survival.\nIt is therefore important that we intensify international solidarity to ensure a harmonious organization and complementary strategies so as to eradicate this pandemic.\nMr. President,\nI note with sustained interest the highly significant theme of this general debate, namely \u201cThe future we want, the UN we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism \u2014 confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action\u201d.\nIndeed, strengthening multilateral cooperation mechanisms, within the framework of the fight against coronavirus, is the challenge facing the entire international community, given the scale of the economic and health consequences induced by this scourge.\nUndoubtedly, there is no way out of this unprecedented health crisis and no development possible in isolation.\nThe United Nations therefore remains the main instrument capable of mobilizing States as part of an effort of compromise, even consensus, around collective action against inequalities and vulnerabilities.\nIn view of the difficult economic situation facing the world economy, the reassertion of multilateralism constitutes the essential basis of international action to fulfil our collective commitments, in particular to ensure access to universal health coverage, promote education for all, protect the environment and sustainably preserve peace.\nMr. President,\nAs we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, and despite the progress made, we are still witnessing the resurgence of untenable deprivation among populations.\nAs a result, the establishment of \u201chealth for all\u201d is experiencing real difficulties.\nThe eradication of poverty in all its forms remains an international priority.\nHowever, we will only succeed if States possess the necessary resources, in a world that is truly at peace.\nMr. President,\nThe Republic of the Congo is concerned about the upsurge in terrorism and violent extremism as well as the prevalence of armed conflict around the world.\nThis is the case with the Libyan crisis, the ramifications of which are increasingly affecting the Sahel States.\nIn this regard, as Chair of the African Union High Level Committee on Libya, my country reaffirms the primacy of a political solution by promoting the holding of the inclusive inter-Libyan conference on national reconciliation.\nThe various meetings held in Brazzaville and the Berlin conference on peace in Libya have encouraged those involved in that conflict to favour dialogue, within the framework of a multilateral approach that includes the UN. To this end, the road map adopted in Brazzaville on 30 January 2020 remains valid.\nThe eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is still under threat from armed groups.\nIn the same vein, the Central African Republic, which is preparing for a presidential election in December 2020, is facing a volatile situation caused by the murderous activism of armed gangs.\nFor its part, Syria has been facing a civil war since 2011, with devastating consequences.\nIsraeli-Palestinian relations remain tense despite relevant United Nations resolutions calling for the creation of two independent States.\nMoreover, the situation in the Republic of Cuba calls for the lifting of unilateral sanctions, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.\nFinally, the 75th anniversary of the UN coincides with that of the first nuclear test. Humanity should forever ban the use of nuclear weapons.\nMr. President,\nAs we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, it behoves us to repair a historic injustice, by guaranteeing Africa its rightful place on the Security Council.\nIn its capacity as member of the African Union Committee of Ten on the reform of the United Nations Security Council, my country solemnly reaffirms the urgent need to render effective Africa\u2019s representativeness within that organ of the UN.\nIn this way, the values of peace, solidarity, equity and progress that are embodied in the United Nations will be further bolstered.\nLong live the United Nations!\nLong live international cooperation!\nThank you."

        "file_text": "Ladies and Gentlemen, Heads of State and Government of the world.\nI am very pleased to speak with members of the General Assembly on the occasion of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations.\nI represent a great country \u2014 Mexico, which has a history and cultural tradition like those of other peoples of the world. I could tell members about the great civilizations that comprise the foundation of our country today and of the great cultures that flourished in what is now Mexico. I speak of civilization and cultures because those who conquer, dominate and colonize always try to justify their atrocities by disqualifying the original peoples by calling them barbarians and savages. This does not apply to Mexico, our people or other peoples of the world, who were dominated, conquered or colonized. We have an extraordinary history, which also involves the struggle for freedom, justice and equality in defending our national sovereignty. There are three great transformations in the history of Mexico.\nFirst, with regard to independence, after 300 years of being a colony, we gained our independence. That was the first transformation at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Two rebel priests, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla and Jose Maria Morelos y Pavon led a movement for Mexico\u2019s independence and a movement for justice, as they were the first to proclaim the abolition of slavery.\nLater, in the mid-nineteenth century, we underwent a second transformation, which was very important and of global significance \u2014 the reform movement led by a great leader, a liberal and the best President in our history: a Zapotec Indian, Benito Juarez Garcia. What did our hero do with regard to the reform at that time? He separated church from State before other countries did so and he applied the biblical principle of \u201cRender to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s, and to God the things that are God\u2019s\u201d.\nA third transformation then took place at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century: the Mexican Revolution of 1910. Democracy was fought for as Mexico had suffered a 34-year dictatorship. The struggle was waged to guarantee freedoms and bring about justice. Two very important social leaders who preceded the Revolution were the Flores Magon brothers. An unquestionably good man and an apostle of democracy Francisco y Madero was murdered in cowardly fashion as were social leaders like Francisco Villa, who defended the peasants and was loyal to the people, and Emiliano Zapata.\nWith the third transformation, much progress was made in the social, but not the political, arena, as establishing a truly authentic democracy in the country was not possible. Following the Revolution, a party was created. It was a political party, which was to predominate for a long time, and only then did we take the first steps to make Mexico into a truly authentic democratic country. Possibly due to the lack of democracy, among other factors, the country\u2019s public life fell into disarray. Political corruption, which was for a long time Mexico\u2019s main problem, began to prevail. Our country enjoys many natural riches, including fertile land for agricultural production, abundant water, oil, mines and a good, noble, working people with a cultural heritage spanning millennia, which is the source of the people\u2019s proclivity for work and creativity. We were unable, however, to move forward because of the corruption that prevailed. For a long time, we fought to achieve a real change in the country, and, after many years, what the people of Mexico decided to do was elect us. And we have proposed to carry out the fourth transformation of our country\u2019s public life.\nI spoke earlier of independence, reform and revolution, and now we are committed to carrying out the fourth transformation of the country\u2019s public life, without violence in a peaceful manner. We are achieving that, despite the fact that we are facing two crises, as are other countries around the world. We are dealing with the terrible coronavirus disease pandemic. And, as in other countries, we are also facing what set of the pandemic \u2014 the economic crisis. We are facing two crises at the same time, but we are overcoming. We are moving forward and confronting the pandemic. We have acted responsibly, and we have been abundantly helped by the experts, the scientists, the doctors, the nurses and the health-care workers, who have dedicated themselves with their humanity to save lives. As we move forward, the harmful effects of the pandemic will diminish. What matters most to us is saving lives, and we are moving forward. With regard to the economic aspect, we are not applying the perennial strategy of placing the country into a state of indebtedness and rescuing those above with the sophist rational that, if it rains hard upstairs, the rain will drip down, as if wealth were somehow contagious.\nWhat did we do? We are supporting the people directly from below, from the bottom up. We are allocating resources that are the product of savings, because we do not allow corruption. Those savings are also the fruits of the Republic\u2019s austerity, as luxuries in the Government are a thing of the past. I will tell the General Assembly that, although there is still a presidential plane, it is up for sale. We have offered it up for auction and intend to sell it. The plane is like a palace in the sky, which is insulting to our people \u2014 a luxury plane that was intended to seat 240 passengers and was adapted for 80. It has a meeting room and bedrooms, and, I repeat, that it is offensive. As of now as, the President of Mexico, who is speaking to the General Assembly, travels by car and commercial aeroplanes. Public officials and servants are no longer permitted to use private helicopters.\nIn addition, among other things, the elite corps that used to tend to the President has been eliminated. Do you know how many members of that elite corps took care of the President? There were 8,000 of them. It was a longstanding institution, known as the Presidential General Staff. And, like that, the luxury and the extravagance ended. The Government cannot be allowed to be rich if the people are poor. The solution is to forbid corruption and save \u2014 to eschew ostentation and luxuries in the Government and disburse funds for development.\nWe are allocating all that we are reaping from the solution, which precludes corruption and embraces an austere and sober Government, in order to support the humble people and the dispossessed. Every elderly person in Mexico enjoys the right to a pension, and all children with disabilities receive financial assistance. Eleven million poor students receive scholarships and benefit from many social programmes.\nThat is what is being invested, in addition to the support provided by fellow migrants, the now 38 million Mexicans who, out of necessity went to the United Sates to seek new lives and livelihoods. They include those born here and those born there of Mexican parentage. A total of 38 million assist us by providing economic support to their relatives in Mexico with so-called remittances. Despite the pandemic, this year will be a record year for remittances. Approximately $40 billion will be received. And, month after month, that money reaches 10 million poor families in our country. We boost consumption with Government investment and remittances. Despite the pandemic and the crisis, there is no hunger in our country. Basic consumption is being guaranteed to millions of Mexicans.\nLittle by little, the economy is recovering. Furthermore, we have just signed an agreement with the United States and Canada \u2014 a treaty that has already come into force. This means that investments are already being made in the country, companies are being established and jobs are being created, which will ensure the well-being of Mexicans.\nI have considerable faith in the future of Mexico, but I also have faith in the future of the world. I am a believer and my creed is that of universal brotherhood. That is why I sent you all best wishes from Mexico City, the capital of our Republic."

        "file_text": "Mr. President! Excellencies! Ladies and Gentlemen,\n75 years ago, the world cautiously rose from the horrors and the destruction of the Second World War. Humanity had experienced the darkest abyss of racial hate, cruelty and violence. And Austria is fully aware of its own responsibilities in this regard.\nBut after the devastation and suffering there was also hope. Nations came together to break the endless circle of violence and despair which marked human history for centuries. The vision of a world at peace received its institutional form.\nSince its creation, the United Nations has worked for the progress of humanity. It has made our planet safer by setting and improving global standards on human rights, rule of law, accountability, conflict prevention, peacekeeping and disarmament.\nSince joining the UN in 1955 Austria is proud and honoured to contribute in all these areas. Whether in 60 years of Peacekeeping, or as a member \u2014 and current president \u2014 of the Human Rights Council. Austria will continue to do its part and is ready assume further responsibilities. For this particular reason, we are a candidate for the UN Security Council 2027-2028 and hope for your support.\nLadies and Gentlemen!\nAs any organization, the UN is not free of faults. The United Nations are often side-lined from solving conflicts. And the Security Council all too often fails to achieve consensus on how to bring peace to the world\u2019s worst crises. But overall \u2014 if we compare today\u2019s standards with those 75 years ago, for example on children\u2019s education, women\u2019s rights, child mortality, access to clean drinking water or extreme poverty and hunger, the UN can really be proud of its achievements.\nHowever, we continue to face numerous threats, some of which would have been familiar to those meeting in 1945:\n\u00a5\tdozens of armed conflicts,\n\u00a5\tnearly 80 million forcibly displaced persons, as well as\n\u00a5\tterrorism, political repression and extreme poverty.\nThere are also new and emerging threats:\n\u00a5\tCyber warfare and the risk of failing technological governance,\n\u00a5\tbioterrorism,\n\u00a5\tnew geopolitical tensions due to an increasingly polycentric\nglobal system\n\u00a5\tand climate change as the potential future super-crisis.\nAt present, one threat, however, towers over all of them: the spread of COVID-19. It affects everyone, everywhere at the same time. The pandemic changes the way we live and the way we work.\nJust look at this General Debate. I would have preferred to speak to you in the General Assembly Hall instead of from Austria. But at least I have the honour to address you today from the UN headquarter in Vienna. And I would have preferred to meet personally with colleagues from around the world rather than via video or telephone. The pandemic deprives us of one of the most essential tools of international relations: enriching personal encounters amongst colleagues. Thus, we have to undertake even more efforts to keep the lines of communication open!\nMr President,\nCOVID-19 has taught us the hard way that much we take for granted is more vulnerable than we believe.\n\u00a5\tInstead of enjoying the liberty of freely moving between continents and within Europe, the pandemic forces us to grapple with travel restrictions. And we have seen only the tip of the iceberg of the pandemic\u2019s social and economic impact. A lot of the progress on reaching the Sustainable Development Goals, which has been achieved over the past decades is endangered today.\n\u00a5\tNearly 24 million children and young people will drop out or not have access to school next year due to the pandemic.\n\u00a5\tCOVID-19 has triggered the most severe recession in almost a century. We see record negative numbers in economic growth, unemployment and inequality. And in international relations, the pandemic fuels the fire of existing geopolitical conflicts, while casting a shadow onto other security threats.\nAs Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said \u201cthe warning lights are flashing\u201d. And indeed: Geopolitical trends that were present before the pandemic have gained further momentum:\n\u00a5\tRe-emerging nationalism, protectionism and populism,\n\u00a5\tdecreasing trust in the international system and\n\u00a5\tincreasing dissemination of misinformation and \u201calternative facts\u201d.\nThe pandemic has proven again that false information can spread faster than the virus. It travels at the speed of thought. At a time when evidenced based decisionmaking is crucial, we witness an erosion of trust in experts, science and technology.\nWhat is more: An increasing number of people see the pandemic as a clear indication that the world as a whole is developing in the wrong direction. Instinctively, they reject the advances in technology in the medical field, science, communication and business.\nTechnological progress has jumped ahead, but it has left parts of the population behind. This growing tension between new technologies and society is a challenge for politics on the national as well as on the international level. New technologies seem partially to overburden our societies. Buzzwords such as human downgrading, cyber crime, trade in data and protection of personal data and privacy come to mind.\nThis list would, however, be incomplete without a warning of autonomous weapons systems \u2014 machines with the power to decide, who lives and who dies. This is not science fiction, it is fast becoming a reality \u2014 a reality that the Secretary- General has rightly called both \u201cpolitically unacceptable and morally repugnant\u201d.\nWe have to act now, before the survival of civilians in a conflict zone is determined by an algorithm and before all constraints laid down in international humanitarian law become redundant and decisions are taken by killer-robots without any human control or ethical concerns.\nAustria will organize an international conference in Vienna next year to address this urgent issue. COVID-19 permitting, I invite all of you to participate!\nOur call for a new digital humanism needs one further reflection: Today is the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons.\nMy speech would not be complete without a strong appeal to get rid of these weapons once and for all. They pose an existential threat to life on this planet and cause tremendous human suffering.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nWhile the fight against COVID-19 has overshadowed everything else, the conflicts and crises around the world have not simply disappeared. Wars and humanitarian crises are not afraid of a virus! On the contrary, many of them were even aggravated by the pandemic.\nWe must ensure that these crises are not obscured by the shadows of COVID-19.\n\u00a5\tYemen is still ravaged by the worst humanitarian crisis of our time.\n\u00a5\tLibya still suffers under a protracted conflict and the manifest disregard for the UN arms embargo.\n\u00a5\tThe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran hangs by a thread, which has led to a spiral of toughening positions.\nFurthermore, new crises have been unfolding in the midst of the pandemic.\n\u00a5\tLebanon continues on a dangerous downward slide.\n\u00a5\tThe Eastern Mediterranean has seen a sharp increase in tensions due to illegal activity by Turkey that could destabilize the whole region.\n\u00a5\tAnd in Belarus, the leadership has to finally accept that the genie of change is out of the bottle and cannot be forced back.\nWe all need to stay alert and not let the headline-grabbing virus distract us. No one should believe that our focus on fighting COVID-19 constitutes a \u201ccarte blanche\u201d for breaching international law or for a military adventure.\nHowever, there were also rare positive signs coming from a region usually lacking in good news. Austria very much welcomes the announcement of normalisation of relations between Israel and the Emirates and Bahrain. We hope these relations will flourish and serve as examples to other countries.\nMr. President,\nAustria joined the United Nations 65 years ago, and in November 1956, in the first speech delivered on behalf of my country, Foreign Minister Leopold Figl said:\n\u201cToday the world looks to this community of nations, in which all its hopes are\nplaced. Will it justify the confidence of the peoples of the earth and assure and\npreserve peace and order, bread and work?\u201d\nIn order to justify this confidence placed in us, it is not enough to meet once a year and lament the crisis of multilateralism. And it is not enough to pay lip-service to international cooperation and the need to implement rules.\nLet\u2019s be honest: When the virus struck, even the most ardent multilateralists focused on keeping their public safe, closing borders, hoarding masks and equipment. And even the toughest my-state first unilateralists looked for international cooperation to secure medical supplies and assistance to overcome the social and economic crisis.\nSo, why don\u2019t we use this pandemic as a game-changer and simply do away with the unnecessary dispute between multilateralists and unilateralists? Let\u2019s change that game, set and match!\nA testing ground for this new approach could be the cooperation on COVID-19 prevention and effective treatment. Newly developed vaccines must be a global public good, accessible to all at a reasonable price!\nYes, as politicians, it is our duty to protect our own citizens. But, the virus does not distinguish between unilateralists and multilateralists. With COVID-19 no one is safe, until everyone is safe. We, therefore, have to avoid all forms of \u201cvaccine nationalism\u201d. Developing a vaccine should not become a new race to the moon.\nI am encouraged by initiatives like the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator and its COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility. And I greatly value the indispensable role of the World Health Organisation.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nThe pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities of our societies and the fragility of humankind. And we all know that the next global disaster is lurking just around the corner, waiting to hit us. Be it climate change, nuclear disasters or cyber crime.\nOur success or failure in taking decisions here at the United Nations does not take place in a vacuum. It reaches deep into our societies and the everyday lives of our citizens. This global crisis has brought home to us one clear lesson: We will succeed or fail together.\nWe, the \u201cpeople of the United Nations\u201d need each other \u2014 and we need a strong and functioning multilateral system. Today and in the next 75 years to come.\nThank you for your attention!"

I would also like to thank His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande for his commitment, dedication and leadership and to congratulate him on successfully completing the work of the 74th Session of the General Assembly, in spite of the extraordinary circumstances the world is facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMalaysia welcomes the theme of this year\u2019s General Assembly \u2014 \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism \u2014 confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action\u201d. I believe the theme resonates well with each one of us, appropriately framing what the world needs during a time of much uncertainty. You can be assured of Malaysia\u2019s support and cooperation in achieving the goals of this session of the General Assembly.\nBefore the onset of man\u2019s newest lethal enemy in the form of the Novel Coronavirus, the world had already been reeling from numerous challenges. As war continued to ravage many parts of the world, the global economic ecosystem faced unsustainable pressure as a result of trade wars and populist political posturing. Amidst all this, the state of the planet continued to suffer neglect while nations continued to bicker over who should take more responsibility to reverse the effects of climate change. All this took place against the backdrop of impoverished immigrants fleeing their homes, risking their lives by taking an arduous journey to a distant land in pursuit of a better life.\nCOVID-19 RESPONSE AND EQUITABLE ACCESS TO VACCINE\nLittle did we know then that the COVID -19 pandemic has caused great disruption to the world. Worse still, this pandemic has affected the most vulnerable populations - women and children; people with disabilities; as well as the marginalised and the displaced. We must remember that COVID-19 does not discriminate and because of that, our response should not too.\nNo country has been spared. The pandemic has levelled the playing field for all nations and the race is on to obtain a vaccine. Until or unless we obtain the antiviral medication required to treat and a vaccine to prevent this novel coronavirus, we can never fully declare victory against it. This is why the manufacturing of a vaccine must promote international collaboration rather than nationalistic competition. Saving lives should be our priority.\nTHREAT OF TERRORISM DUE TO COVID-19\nOn top of the socio-economic impact COVID-19 has had on all of us, we need to also be mindful of the possibility of terrorism rearing its ugly head in this time of uncertainty. We must never discount the fact that terrorist groups could be ramping up their efforts to take advantage of the present uncertain times to further enhance their agenda.\nTransparent communication, good networking, and greater intelligence cooperation at the national and international levels are imperative to counter terrorism and radicalisation during this pandemic. This is a psychological war waged on the vulnerable and we must win over \u201chearts and minds\u201d to succeed. Effective communication strategies at all available channels must be prioritised to ensure that misinformation and disinformation is countered, without infringing respective domestic laws.\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nREFORM OF THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE IN TIMES OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nAs a measure to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, governments are implementing lockdowns and rolling out initiatives to ensure that people do not lose their jobs and businesses do not shut down.\nThe economic and financial impact of the pandemic has brought big and small corporations to their knees. We have witnessed how decades of hard work and dedication have been reduced to bankruptcy or even the downsizing of companies on an unimaginable scale. This has resulted in thousands of jobs lost. This is precisely the reason why the economic devastation of this magnitude needs the collective action of the international community. There is a need to soften the impact to the livelihoods of all those affected.\nFor Malaysia, the Government has put in place mitigating strategies to address the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 has had on our country. We hope Malaysia not only recovers but emerges stronger from the pandemic. The balancing act that Malaysia strives to achieve - between kickstarting our economy and implementing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to prevent further waves of infection has been nothing short of challenging.\nMalaysia has put in place structural economic reforms in facing the new global landscape post COVID-19. We have begun the implementation of economic recovery strategies, followed by an all-inclusive economic revitalization programme. Even though it will take some time before we see the results, we will continue to try our level best to return to some semblance of normalcy. And we know we can only do better with the help of the international community.\nREFORM OF THE UNITED NATIONS\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nUnfortunately, the United Nations has been rather slow in aiding the response of Member States to COVID-19. For instance, in the first few months of the pandemic, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) failed to discuss the issue even though the pandemic clearly poses a grave threat to the security of the world. Only on 1st July 2020 did the United Nations Security Council adopt a resolution to demand an immediate cessation of hostilities, which would allow nations to refocus resources on combatting the pandemic. This is a positive step. However, we can only imagine the benefits of such action if it had been undertaken much sooner.\nDifferences in the Security Council left the body, as it has so many times, indecisive and ineffective. We must be brutally honest with ourselves and admit that after more than seven decades, surely the fate of the world\u2019s peace and security should not continue to be left in the hands of a few. It is about time that the composition of the Security Council better reflects the United Nations\u2019 current membership. The five permanent seats in the Security Council, reserved for the veto-wielding five victors of a World War, has proven that the organization needs to be reformed. There would not be an alliance to pursue a common goal if one party thinks it has more right to decide than the others.\nSince 1946, the veto has been wielded more than 200 times. There is nothing democratic in the way the veto is used. The veto is open to abuse, be it sanctimoniously, hypocritically or to uphold wrongdoings. This is why we need to move the reform process forward. Only with an improved Security Council and United Nations can the world hope to see problems being addressed effectively.\nTHE FUTURE OF PALESTINE AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES\nOne of the most glaring failures of the United Nations is the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Despite the countless calls by the international community since the founding of the United Nations, the will of the majority continues to be negated by the few. They hide their true intentions under the guise of national security and the notion of justice. Wars took place and millions lost their lives have portrayed that the very same actors caught in some of the worst tragedies, have chosen to remain oblivious.\nFor there to be lasting peace in the Middle East, the prescribed international consensus, in conjunction with international law; United Nations resolutions; and the UN Charter, Israel must do several things. First, it must cease all of its illegal settlement activities. Second, it must withdraw its troops from the Occupied Palestinian Territory and surrounding Arab states. Third, it must allow Palestinian refugees their right to return to their land and property. Fourth, it must restore the original status of Jerusalem. And last but certainly not least, it must restore its credibility and revert to the negotiating table with Palestine.\nThese are not new preconditions. These are merely a reflection of years of diplomatic work and the consensus reached over decades of negotiations. Israel can no longer be in denial. Israel continues to threaten Palestinian statehood with further annexation of Palestinian land, further denying Palestine any semblance of human security or peace. Malaysia\u2019s position on this matter remains clear and consistent. Annexation is unlawful. It violates the Charter of the United Nations, Geneva Conventions and relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council. The acquisition of any territory by war or force is inadmissible and illegal. As such, there will never be nor can there ever be any legitimacy in Israel\u2019s actions against Palestine.\nTogether with the rest of the international community, Malaysia will continue to reaffirm its support to the realization of the State of Palestine based on the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. The only viable way forward is a negotiated two-state solution. In this context, Malaysia supports the call of the international community including by the UN Secretary General, for the Middle East Quartet to find a mutually agreeable path for the parties to re-engage towards a negotiated, peaceful settlement. We continue to call upon the international community to uphold Palestine\u2019s legitimate right to self determination, which constitutes one of the very core principles of the United Nations when it was created 75 years ago.\nSITUATION SURROUNDING THE ROHINGYA\nAnother glaring example is the plight of the Rohingya. When atrocities were committed en-masse against the Rohingya in the State of Rakhine, thousands fled their homes fearing for their lives. Many died while crossing oceans and land in search of safety, whilst many others fell victim to opportunistic human trafficking rings promising the Rohingya a life they could only dream of. Yet they still choose to make that life threatening decision to leave home out of sheer desperation.\nThe spill-over effects of the crisis in the Rakhine State, which includes the mass migration of people from Myanmar have significantly impacted not only Malaysia, but also other neighbouring countries. Malaysia currently hosts the largest number of Rohingya refugees in Southeast Asia. As a developing nation coping with the cost of managing and providing protection to nearly 180,000 registered refugees and asylum seekers in the country, with 86% of them from Myanmar, our resources are stretched thin. Yet, Malaysia is expected to do more to accommodate these incoming refugees. Is that fair?\nAlthough Malaysia is not party to the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol, Malaysia has taken up the social and financial responsibility in providing humanitarian assistance and protection to Rohingya refugees on humanitarian grounds. The time has come for State Parties to the Convention to shoulder a proportionate burden and responsibility in addressing the problem by opening their doors for more refugees for resettlement and relocation.\nAddressing the influx of these refugees into our borders is one side of the story. The bigger question is how can the international community play a more meaningful role to end the atrocities in the Rakhine State?\nThese are just two glaring examples why a stronger and better United Nations is necessary. The credibility of the United Nations can and must be restored, in order to build \u201cthe future we want, the United Nations we need\u201d. This can only be done if we find the moral courage and political will to do what is right.\nSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS/CLIMATE CRISIS\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nMalaysia has and will continue to support the accelerated action and transformative pathways of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Our development plans have always been geared towards sustainability both for the environment and for the living, and have been embedded into the five-yearly national development plans. It has also been included into Malaysia\u2019s Shared Prosperity Vision 2030, which aims to develop a fair and equitable distribution of economic development at all levels by 2030, as envisaged by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nSince Malaysia implemented the Movement Control Order (MCO) in March, we found that air quality readings in Malaysia has improved two folds, from 28% to 57%. The fear is that this could only be a temporary reprieve as global carbon emissions may rise again if we continue to be complacent and do a \u2018business as usual\u2019 approach in our post economic recovery plan. The pandemic must therefore be treated as a turning point. It is important for the entire international community to respect the planet\u2019s limits and value our natural resources.\nJust like everybody else, Malaysia is also concerned about the environment. At the same time, Malaysia is one of the biggest producers of palm oil. Many farmers and smallholders are dependent on this crucial commodity to sustain their livelihoods. However, critics have linked palm oil to the destruction of the world\u2019s precious rainforests and the extinction of wildlife. They also claim that it is dangerous to health. These claims are way far from the truth. Malaysia has over 60 national laws and regulations covering the protection of wildlife and the environment; health; the safety and welfare of workers; and control of pollutants. We are pleased and honoured to inform that we have managed to retain 55% of our rainforests, exceeding 5% of our earlier commitment.\nMULTILATERALISM AND UN75\nExcellencies, ladies and gentlemen,\nThis year marks the 75th anniversary of the United Nations. For the past 75 years, the United Nations has been the centre of international relations. In the eyes of some, it can be considered as a failure, while others see it as a success. Call it what you want, but it is difficult to deny that the United Nations has managed to allow human society to progress in so many aspects \u2014 from education to the environment, to the health and social security of millions.\nUnfortunately, in recent times multilateral commitments are becoming less persuasive because states are less willing to uphold shared values and solve challenges together. Governments are turning inwards, pushing a national perspective that wins more immediate public support. The United Nations should not be a platform to do this. It should be a capable institution that can hear and collectively address the concerns of its members and the problems that beset the world.\nIn preserving stability, tranquillity and peace, Malaysia has long held the belief that our world demands for collaborative engagement by all. It is, therefore, in our interest that the international community works together to uphold a system based on our shared universal values through dialogues and cooperation.\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nTurning 75 is indeed a significant achievement. As such, let us not see the Seventy-Fifth Anniversary of the United Nations go by without a resolve to fulfil our collective responsibilities. We need to build back better for our peoples not just for now but also for generations to come. Rest assured that the United Nations has Malaysia\u2019s fullest commitment to multilateralism, based on the purposes and principles as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\nThank you."

We acknowledge his efforts and convey our recognition and satisfaction.\nMr. President,\nFrom this rostrum, on behalf of the people and the Government of the Central African Republic, I would also like to take this opportunity to convey our gratitude for the kind attention that my country, the Central African Republic, receives from the international community, despite your many commitments and requests.\nAllow me to reiterate all our gratitude to and confidence in Mr. Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, for his sustained commitment to global peace and development, and, in particular, for his constant and multifaceted support to the Central African Republic.\nMr. President,\nThis year\u2019s Assembly is being held amid special circumstances, as humankind, as a whole, faces the regrettable COVID-19 pandemic, which has claimed several lives throughout the world.\nWe pay tribute to the memory of all those across the world who succumbed to this pandemic, which humankind combats daily and collectively.\nSince the start of this health crisis, the Central African Republic, as other countries in the world, has not been spared. Our assessment of the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 indicates that my country\u2019s economy is expected to contract between 0.8 per cent and 1.2 per cent.\nI therefore call on the entire international community to make a greater investment in the quest for common measures and solutions to eradicate this health crisis.\nMr. President,\nIn light of the many challenges facing humankind related to security, the environment, climate change, human mobility, human rights, terrorism, denuclearization, the dismantling of weapons of mass destruction and the COVID-19 pandemic, the choice of this year\u2019s theme \u2014 \u201cThe future we want, the UN we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism\u201d \u2014 reaffirms that multilateralism has always been and remains the instrument to effectively combat certain scourges and the means to minimize certain antagonisms at the international level.\nOn the occasion of this seventy-fifth anniversary, it is essential to recall the purposes and principles that govern our great Organization through our commitments contained in the Charter of the United Nations, namely to prevent and remove threats to peace; to develop friendly relations among nations; to fight against inequality and all forms of discrimination; and to protect human rights.\nThe present session is also an opportunity to reflect on how our common Organization will be able to face the new challenges affecting the world and our societies.\nToday, more than ever, we must, in spite of our differences, advocate for international cooperation and dialogue, joining our efforts for a better future for humankind.\nThe United Nations remains, and will continue to be, the multilateral framework par excellence.\nMr. President,\nNo human endeavour is perfect, and therefore we must bear in mind the weaknesses identified over the past 75 years and find effective and lasting solutions to them.\nIn that regard, the Central African Republic wishes to add its voice to the call of some States and the African Union for Security Council reform.\nIt is a matter of looking beyond narrow self-interests and giving priority to common interests, while avoiding confrontation, in favour of a joint strategy for our world, which is facing unprecedented changes and upheavals.\nIt is also a matter of African representation in the organs of our shared Organization, in particular the Security Council, which is the central decisionmaking body.\nThrough multilateralism, we can ensure a more secure and stable future for humankind, which aspires only to peace, justice and sustainable development for all.\nMr. President,\nI would also like to take this opportunity to share developments in the situation in my country. Thanks to the combined efforts of the international community and under the auspices of the African Union, the Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in the Central African Republic was signed between the Central African Government and 14 armed groups on 6 February 2019.\nSince the signing of the Agreement, the Central African Government and the guarantors and facilitators of the Agreement have spared no effort to implement and respect the commitments contained therein.\nIn addition, the Government has made a great deal of progress in the area of security sector reform, which will facilitate the gradual redeployment of the defence and security forces and the continuation of the national DDRR programme, which has already been launched in preparation for the upcoming elections scheduled for the 2020-2021 period.\nDespite the Government\u2019s willingness to respect the commitments contained in the Political Agreement, massive violations of international humanitarian law and human rights continue to be perpetrated against the civilian population by certain armed groups that are signatories to the Agreement. Those groups are also continuing to rearm through illegal means, thereby undermining the peace and national reconciliation process, which is a guarantee of social cohesion.\nMr. President,\nNotwithstanding the considerable progress made in the implementation of security sector reforms in the Central African Republic, many challenges are yet to be addressed, including the genuine commitment of armed groups to DDRR and the special joint security units; the sustained support of the international community in the implementation of the APPR-RCA; the conduct of operations and the means for operational engagement; and the mobilization of resources at the national level and from development partners.\nMr. President,\nIn order to adhere to the constitutional deadline, the National Electoral Authority is working, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, to ensure that the elections are held according to the established timeline.\nTo date, the census and dismemberment operations are continuing outside the country and will be immediately followed by the publication of the electoral roll \u2014 a condition for the convocation of the electorate for the first round of elections.\nThe Government is working closely with the organizational structure of the Electoral Assistance Project (PAPEC) 2019-2022, which is built around key coordination mechanisms.\nMr. President,\nThe Government, with the support of MINUSCA, continues to make progress in the restoration of State authority throughout the national territory, the redeployment of defence and security forces and State services and the restoration of basic social services.\nThe Central African army is now steadily regaining its operational capacities and I can assure you of my determination to create the necessary conditions for the reconstruction of the Central African Republic in order to restore confidence and joie de vivre among Central Africans.\nTo that end, I reiterate the appeal of the Central African people to the Security Council to fully lift the arms embargo, the burden of which limits our national army in its role as a republican army, in order to ensure the true authority of the State and guarantee the integrity of our national territory.\nMr. President,\nBefore concluding my remarks, I would like to recall that my country continues to make efforts in the implementation of the National Plan for Recovery and Peacebuilding (RCPCA), which is evaluated regularly with our partners.\nWhile tangible progress has been made, much remains to be done. To that end, we are committed to preserving and consolidating the gains made, improving on our weaknesses and continuing to make progress in the search for peace and economic recovery.\nThe task at hand is immense and, as the saying goes, \u201cThe bird can only take flight when it is supported by the air\u201d.\nI therefore hope that the international community will remain mobilized in that spirit of international solidarity alongside the Government and people of the Central African Republic in order to achieve my country\u2019s recovery.\nI hope for great success in our work.\nLong live multilateralism!\nLong live international cooperation and solidarity!\nI thank you."

        "file_text": "Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister\nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh\nIn the name of Allah, the most gracious, the most merciful\nMr. President,\nAssamu Alaikum.\nI congratulate you on your election as the President of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly.\nWe are passing through an unprecedented crisis in the history of humankind due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is also the first time in the UN\u2019s history that the General Assembly is taking place on digital platform without the presence in person of the Heads of States and the Heads of Governments at the UN Headquarters in New York.\nThis General Assembly Hall evokes deep emotions in me. From this very hall in 1974, my father Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman delivered a speech for the first time in Bangla as the Head of Government of a newly independent country. I also had the privilege of attending the General Assembly Sessions in-person for 16 times. I emphasized world peace and solidarity in all my speeches. As a Head of Government, this year I am delivering my 17th speech in the Assembly.\nI take this opportunity to pay my tribute to all frontline fighters including health workers and public servants who are working tirelessly to ensure safety of the affected countries and population. I also commend the United Nations Secretary- General for his bold leadership and multilateral efforts during this crisis. Bangladesh was among the first rank of countries to endorse the Secretary-General\u2019s various initiatives, including his global ceasefire appeal.\nJust as the Second World War created opportunities for countries to come together in their efforts to cooperate, through the establishment of the United Nations, similarly this pandemic has emphasized the need for collective action under the guidance of right leadership.\nWith profound gratitude, I remember the undisputed leader Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the greatest Bangalee of all time. He taught the Bangalee nation to stand firm in the world by ending exploitation, deprivation, and oppression. Following his footsteps, we have been able to secure a respectable position for Bangladesh in the comity of nation. From this august Assembly he declared, \u201cThe noble ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations are the very ideals for which millions of our people have made the supreme sacrifice\u201d.\nThe Bangalee nation fully commits itself to the building of a world order, in which the aspiration of all men for peace and justice will be realized.\u201d His statement was indeed a bold expression for multilateralism. The reflection that Bangabandhu made in 1974 continues to remain equally relevant even today, as we grapple with the current crisis.\nThis year is particularly significant for the Bangalee nation, as we are celebrating the birth centenary of the Father of our Nation. Our reflection on his life, struggle, and sacrifice and celebration of his achievements, is a source of our encouragement for brighter future and give us the hope to cope with the challenge of COVID-19. On the birth centenary, we, on behalf of all deprived people and nations pay rich tribute to Bangabandhu.\nI remember, with deep pain, the brutal assassination of my father, Father of the Bangalee Nation and the then President Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on 15 August 1975 along with 18 members of my family including my mother, three brothers, two sisters-in law. The lives of myself and my younger sister were fortunately spared as we were out of the country at that time. We had to stay abroad as refugees for six long years. I mention this to this Assembly so that the world does not see the repetition of such heinous, brutal and unjust killings ever.\nMr. President,\nThe pandemic is a stark reminder that our fates are interconnected and that no one is secured until everyone is secured. This pandemic to a large extent kept us restricted to our homes. Consequently, our economic activities were greatly hampered along with our health systems. Bangladesh achieved a GDP growth rate of 8.2 per cent in the fiscal year 2018-2019. But the COVID 19 pandemic has impeded our economic progress.\nHowever, in Bangladesh from the beginning we took initiatives putting equal emphasize on the lives and livelihoods of our people. We have announced stimulus packages aiming to minimize the impact of the pandemic on our business and productivity. We have greatly expanded social safety nets coverage.\nEvery year, we allocate around 39 billion taka for our freedom fighters. Our allowances for the elderly, widows, destitute women, disabled and other backward sections of the society are benefitting approx 9.1 million families.\nWe have readily arranged food and other assistance for people who are rendered jobless due to COVID-19. This arrangement has benefitted nearly 10 million families. We have provided scholarships to 4 million students. We have also given cash incentives to five million people including farmers, workers and laborers affected by the pandemic. To ensure healthcare of the common people, we are providing 30 types of medicines free of cost through 18,000 community clinics and union health centres.\nAlongwith government assistance, I myself have collected funds and distributed more than an amount of 2.5 billion taka among the orphans, poor students, Madrasas, Mosques, Temples, school teachers, artists, journalists who are otherwise not included in government\u2019s assistance programmes. As a result, the impact of the pandemic among our people has been minimal.\nWe announced 31-point directives soon after the detection of COVID-19 cases in the country. We launched vigorous awareness raising campaigns as well as distributed personal protective kits aiming to contain the spread of the Corona virus. These resulted in containment of seasonal diseases which are otherwise common in our country.\nWe quickly identified the impending challenges of our financial sector and announced 21 stimulus packages. These packages include sectors such as exportintensive industries, safety and security of the workers, working capital for Small and Medium Enterprises, loan facilities for export growth, assistance to farmers and agriculture, loan for employment generation, interest relief for the affected business enterprises, refinancing schemes and insurance for the health workers. So far, we have announced stimulus package worth $13.25 billion, which is equivalent to 4.03 per cent of our total GDP.\nDuring the pandemic, highest emphasis has been placed on food production. At the same time, we have taken all measures to ensure adequate supply of nutrition for our people. Special arrangements have been made for keeping the industries running and for proper marketing of agricultural products and industrial outputs in full compliance with health guidelines. Consequently, our health sector and economy are still comparatively at a better shape. Despite the COVID-19-induced stagnation in global industrial outputs, our GDP has registered a growth rate of 5.24 per cent, which is expected to be 7 per centin the next fiscal year.\nMr. President,\nWe hope that the COVID-19 vaccine will soon be available in the world. It is imperative to treat the vaccine as a \u2018global public good.\u2019 We need to ensure the timely availability of this vaccine to all countries at the same time. If we are provided with the technical know-how and patents, the pharmaceutical industry of Bangladesh has the capacity to go for vaccine production in mass-scale.\nEfforts to contain the pandemic and achieve Agenda 2030 have to go hand- in-hand. Bangladesh\u2019s second voluntary national review (VNR) presented this year shows that we are well on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.\nWe are working hard to transform Bangladesh into a middle-income country by 2021, attain the SDGs by 2030, a developed country by 2041 and a prosperous Delta by 2100.\nWe cannot but emphasize more on the importance of leveraging science, technology, and innovation for closing the digital divide and mobilizing resources and technology transfer. It is also crucial that graduating LDCs and recently graduated ones are accorded scaled-up international support and incentive packages in the transition and post-transition phases to minimize the pandemic-triggered impediments.\nThe migrant workers are the frontline contributors to the economies of their host and home countries alike. Many of them have lost their jobs during the pandemic while many have been sent back home. We have allocated $361 million for the returnee migrant workers. It is critical to help them regain employment in the post-COVID-19 job market. I urge the international community and migrant receiving countries to treat migrant workers fairly and with empathy.\nMr. President,\nThe pandemic is worsening the pre-existing vulnerabilities of climate- vulnerable countries. In Bangladesh, we are dealing with the dual impact of recent floods and the cyclone Amphan even during the pandemic. As the current President of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) and the V-20 Group of Ministers of Finance, Bangladesh would lead the Forum to map out a sustainable and climate-resilient pathway out of the crisis. We also stand ready to contribute to securing a constructive and productive outcome in the Glasgow COP.\nThe Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action has helped the international community come a long way to ensure gender equality. As we are celebrating the 25th Anniversary of the Declaration, we need to strengthen our resolve and mutual cooperation to address all the critical areas of concern. In Bangladesh, we have closed 72.6 per cent of our overall gender gap. Women\u2019s contribution remains at the core of our national development. They are also at the forefront of pandemic response and recovery efforts.\nIn Bangladesh we are implementing special programmes for the development of children. As the current President of the UNICEF Executive Board, we are leading efforts to address the existing disparity. At the same time, we remain vigilant to ensure that this health crisis does not turn into a children\u2019s crisis.\nMr. President,\n\u201cFriendship to all and malice to none\u201d is the fundamental principle of our Foreign policy. Inspired by this foreign policy dictum, Bangladesh has been consistently contributing to international peace and security and the establishment of a Culture of Peace.\nDuring the pandemic, we see the rise of hate speech, xenophobia, and intolerance. Embracing the spirit of a Culture of Peace can help address these worrying trends. Currently, we are the largest troops and police contributing country in the world to the peacekeeping missions. Our peacekeepers are putting their lives on the line to secure and sustain peace in conflict-ravaged countries. International community must ensure their safety and security.\nThis year we are celebrating the 20th Anniversary of the Women, Peace and Security Agenda. As one of its original proponents, we call for due recognition of women\u2019s role in peace and security. We have already formulated a national action plan in this regard.\nOur unflinching commitment to peace has resulted in the adoption of a zero- tolerance policy towards terrorism and violent extremism. National efforts have to be complemented by international cooperation to curb this menace.\nWe consistently and strongly support the global quest for a nuclear weapons free world. To that end we support the aspirations of developing countries to benefit from the peaceful use of nuclear technology.\nMr. President,\nOur painful experience and the worst form of genocide and crimes against humanity that our nation had to endure during our struggle for independence motivated us to support the legitimate cause of the Palestinian people.\nBangladesh provided temporary shelter to over 1.1 million forcibly displaced Myanmar Nationals. More than three years have elapsed. Regrettably, not a single Rohingya could be repatriated. The problem was created by Myanmar and its solution must be found in Myanmar. I request the international community to play a more effective role for a solution to the crisis.\nMr. President,\nThe pandemic has indeed aggravated existing global challenges. It has also reinforced the indispensability of multilateralism. On this 75th Anniversary of the United Nations, our commitment to multilateralism as embodied in the UN Charter remains unflinching. At the national level, despite numerous challenges, we are committed to upholding the values of multilateralism and working towards building a \u201cShonar Bangla\u201d free of poverty and exploitation based on democratic principles with full enjoyment of human rights, as envisioned by the Father of our Nation. On the birth centenary of our Father of the Nation, this is our pledge to our nation and to the world.\nI thank you all again.\nKhoda Hafez.\nJoi Bangla, Joi Bangabandhu\nMay Bangladesh live forever."

I would have loved to congratulate you in person rather than through the video-teleconference technique that was imposed on us by the current global health situation. I would also like to extend my acknowledgment to H.E. Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande my recognition of his efforts in directing the last session of the General Assembly, especially with the disruption of the organization\u2019s work as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.\nI wish to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, for his continuous efforts as head of this international organization, and for his endeavors to support Lebanon after the Beirut Port explosion on August 4. He organized the Beirut Support Conference on 9 August, to mobilize donor pledges and provide basic relief assistance, at the commendable initiative of French President and friend Emmanuel Macron. Moreover, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Lebanese people, I wish to extend our thanks to all Heads of State who participated in the conference and offered support, as well as to all brotherly and friendly countries, governmental and non-governmental organizations, which rushed to provide aid and assistance.\nIn particular, I wish to thank His Holiness Pope Francis, who dedicated a universal day of prayer for Lebanon. All of his assistance has had a huge positive impact on our country and our people. Practically, it provided urgent medical and food relief, along with reconstruction materials. Morally, his great solidarity made our people feel that they are not alone, but rather have in this world brothers and sisters in humanity who did not hesitate to support it.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nBeirut is trying today to rise from its ruins. Indeed, with the solidarity of all the Lebanese people and your support, it will heal its wounds and rise as it has done over and over again throughout history. The earthquake-like explosion that hit our capital left a deep scar on the Lebanese conscience. Indeed, the pictures of the victims, the pain of the injured, and the tears of those who lost a beloved one, will never be wiped away.\nMaterial damages are unprecedented. The Port of Beirut, the vital crossing for economic activity in Lebanon, was not only destroyed, but around 200,000 residential units were also damaged. Many of them are uninhabitable. Almost 300,000 people lost their homes, with winter approaching. In addition, the infrastructure, the power grid and the water network have been tremendously devastated.\nThe fallout will not only affect economic activity, but will also cause a sharp increase in poverty rates \u2014 already at 45 per cent before the blast. The World Bank estimated economic losses from the explosion at around $3.5 billion, material losses at around $4.5 billion, and urgent reconstruction needs at around $2 billion.\nBeirut was declared a disaster-stricken city. The Lebanese Army has undertaken the management of emergency relief in collaboration with other UN agencies, the Red Cross, licensed NGOs, and volunteers.\nIt has conducted survey operations to determine the damages and assess needs and priorities. The Army received local and international aid, sorted it, and distributed it. It has been very keen on adopting the strictest criteria of probity and transparency.\nAs for the next phase, the Army is dedicated to reconstruction. Its advanced emergency cell oversees the reconstruction of the partially affected residential and commercial units. However, the greatest problem is the totally demolished neighborhoods and facilities. There is a tremendous need for support from the international community to rebuild them. The soundest solution may be to divide the devastated area into geographical zones and let every country that wishes to help commit to a specific zone and undertake its reconstruction directly.\nIn the course of the investigation, all Lebanese want to know the truth and see justice done. We have forwarded the blast file to the Judicial Council, the highest penal judicial body in Lebanon. A judicial investigator has been appointed and is carrying out his probes and procedures. Immediately after the blast, we asked for international technical assistance to help provide us with satellite pictures at the moment of explosion, discover the itinerary and history of the ammonium, nitrate- loaded vessel from its departure to its arrival at the Beirut Port, and analyze the soil, materials, and anything else that might unveil what happened. Indeed, teams came from several countries and conducted the necessary research. We are still waiting for information about the mystery of the ship and for satellite pictures to clear the ambiguities in this part of the investigation. The results will end up in the Judicial Council under Lebanese sovereign jurisdiction.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nLebanon is in the middle of an unprecedented crisis. Calamities have erupted all at once \u2014 a severe recession due to the economic and financial situation, the COVID-19 crisis and its repercussions, and finally the Beirut Port disaster. Lebanon\u2019s very core has been stricken from both a humanitarian and economic point of view. The situation is extremely critical.\nIn addition, the Syrian displacement crisis has been lingering for ten years. Although Lebanon is not an asylum country, and its Constitution does not accept final settlement, it has dealt with the displacement problem based on humanitarian principles and international law, in particular the principle of non-refoulement.\nNevertheless, today, amidst Lebanon\u2019s successive crises, the number of displaced amounts to one-third of its population. The displacement has exacerbated the economic, social, health and humanitarian problems of the host community. Lebanon demands intensified endeavors for the safe and dignified return of the displaced, without linking it to a political solution in Syria, especially since most of the Syrian territories have become safe. The Lebanese Government seeks help to implement the plan it had adopted for the return of the displaced Syrians now that circumstances for their return are more favorable.\nPending the desired return, and confirming the principle of common responsibility and burden sharing among States, Lebanon repeats its call on donor countries to honor their pledges and find a mechanism to follow-up on their commitments. The latter need to double their financial contributions, and provide direct assistance to Lebanese governmental institutions and host communities, in line with Lebanon\u2019s response plan adopted in collaboration with the United Nations.\nLebanon has made a commitment to the international community to carry out a package of administrative, financial and economic reforms aimed at facilitating the economic recovery to which we all aspire.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nLebanon welcomes the Security Council resolution extending the UNIFIL mandate, interpreting it as a strong and unifying message of support to preserve stability therein. It lauds UNIFIL\u2019s sacrifices and grants priority to preserving the safety of its personnel and ensuring their protection. Lebanon highly appreciates the close and continuous cooperation between the Force and the Lebanese Army.\nIn this context, Lebanon reiterates its commitment to the full implementation of resolution 1701 (2006), because we believe that it will consolidate the foundations of stability and security in South Lebanon and benefits the entire region\u2019s stability. Any violation thereof will further complicate the situation. Therefore, Lebanon again calls on the international community to bind Israel to its full obligations in this respect. Israel must cease its land, sea and air violations of Lebanese sovereignty and stop trespassing in Lebanon\u2019s airspace, using it to strike Syrian territories. The international community must also urge Israel to cooperate fully with UNIFIL, demarcate what remains of the Blue Line, and immediately withdraw from Northern Ghajar, the Shebaa Farms and the Kfarshouba Hills.\nLebanon emphasizes its absolute and full rights in its territorial waters, its natural oil and gas resources, and all of its maritime borders according to international law. It looks forward to the role of the United Nations and the friendly countries to help ascertain its rights. It specifically requests US mediation for the necessary negotiations to define and delineate its maritime borders according to international law and in a manner which preserves Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty and rights to its resources.\nToday, seventy-five years after the inception of the United Nations Organization, and in light of increased dialogue about solutions in the Middle East, we reiterate our attachment to the principles on which this organization was founded. Most notably, we commit to the inviolability of internationally recognized borders. We underscore that any negotiations, regardless of their formula or the party conducting them, must take into account sustainable solutions sponsored by concerned parties and in various UN resolutions, notably in Resolution 194, which guarantees Palestinian refugees the right of return. In this context, we would also like to recall the 2002 Beirut Peace Initiative.\nOn the first centenary of the proclamation of Greater Lebanon, we can only affirm that the Lebanese people, in all their diversities, continue to keep Lebanon great and unified, without division or partition.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nThis is the first time in the history of the United Nations that the General Assembly session is held virtually because an invisible virus has prevented us from meeting together and has compelled us to communicate through the video-conference technique. There is no doubt. The world after Covid-19 will not be the same as before. We hope that it will be a more humane world. We all stand united in helplessness from the loss of loved ones and the lack of oxygen.\nLebanon and its people experienced great sympathy after disaster struck Beirut. Many countries and people rushed to express their solidarity and extend a helping hand. Perhaps our world has reclaimed its morality out of Lebanon\u2019s suffering, and that humanity has regained some of its stature in a materialistic world, which venerates the right of force and injustice.\nThe theme for this year\u2019s meeting is: \u201cReaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism through multilateral action.\u201d This is an encouraging signal for the future we want and for the United Nations we need. It can be summarized with one expression: \u201cSolidarity for good\u201d.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "Address by Mr. Sooronbai Zheenbekov, President of the Kyrgyz Republic\nDelivered on Wednesday, 23 September 2020, at the 6th meeting of the General Assembly\n[Original: Russian]\nSecretary-General, Ladies and gentlemen,\nOn behalf of the Kyrgyz Republic, I would like to congratulate you on the occasion of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations. It is impossible to imagine the world without the UN today. The Organization has become the most important tool for resolving social, economic, financial and cultural issues. UN agencies, funds and programmes are vital and effective partners for developing States. On behalf of the people of the Kyrgyz Republic, I thank the United Nations for supporting all our reforms.\nMr. President,\nThe theme of today\u2019s debate accurately reflects the current alarming situation in the world. The COVID-19 pandemic has reminded us how closely interconnected we are. I express my full support to the UN Secretary-General for calling for a global ceasefire and mobilization of international efforts against the pandemic. To date, more than 44,000 cases of the disease have been reported in Kyrgyzstan and, unfortunately, we lost 1,063 citizens. We declared 30 July this year a day of mourning in our country. Thanks to the unity of the people of Kyrgyzstan and the heroic work of our doctors and volunteers we were able to significantly reduce the spread of the virus. The assistance provided to us by the WHO, the United Nations and its swiftly established Fund, as well as international donors, was essential. The support of our allies and strategic partners was important. Ongoing assistance is crucial for us. And universal access to the vaccine is key.\nDistinguished participants,\nThe pandemic has impeded the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and significantly exacerbated the external debt crisis. We welcome the decision of the G20 and the international financial institutions to suspend debt payments. In May this year, at the UN high-level event, we proposed that a mechanism be used for deep debt restructuring in exchange for sustainable development projects. We hope to receive strong support for our initiative.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nThe Kyrgyz Republic supports the efforts of Secretary-General Guterres to reform the Organization. Enhancing the effectiveness of the Security Council, the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council is of particular importance. We attach great importance to security and economic development, the protection of human rights, the rule of law and democracy. Kyrgyzstan has put forward its candidacy for the Human Rights Council and the elected membership of the Security Council for the coming periods. I hope for broad support for our candidacy.\nMr. President,\nThe Kyrgyz Republic, as a depositary of the Central Asian Nuclear-Weapon- Free Zone Treaty, supports the strengthening of approaches to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. Terrorism and extremism are also a serious threat to our peace. The UN should play a central role in coordinating the efforts of the international community\u2019s in combating the terrorist threat. We are committed to the effective implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. We welcome the appointment of a Regional Coordinator for the UN Office of Counter- Terrorism in Bishkek. We stand ready to support him.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nKyrgyzstan has made commitments to achieving Sustainable Development Goals 7 and 13. In November last year, we ratified the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Kyrgyzstan sees the development of a green economy as the most important step in the implementation of these commitments. We strive to be a country with environmentally-friendly products and clean energy. Kyrgyzstan is focused on gradually reducing its consumption of traditional energy sources. We consider it important to use our water and energy potential through the construction of hydroelectric power plants and our participation in the CASA-1000 international project. This will contribute to the accumulation of water resources for the irrigation needs of our neighbours and the sustainable development of the entire region. The Kyrgyz Republic needs the support of the international community to adapt to the negative impacts of climate change.\nMr. President,\nClimate change reduces the volume of glaciers and water resources of Kyrgyzstan. This will lead to a shortage of clean water and pose a threat to public health. It could lead to land degradation and economic risks. In this regard, we advocate the implementation of projects aimed at studying the problem of melting glaciers and their protection. We also believe that it is extremely important to preserve mountain ecosystems in areas where glaciers form. Kyrgyzstan has launched a number of global initiatives in this area. We hosted two global forums on protecting the snow leopard and its mountain ecosystems. A resolution on the role of the international community in preventing the radiation threat in Central Asia was adopted. In August last year, the Group of Friends of Mountainous Countries was created. Today it includes 23 States. It was also important to preserve biological diversity. That is why Kyrgyzstan proposed at this year\u2019s session of the General Assembly a new draft resolution entitled \u201cNature knows no borders: transboundary cooperation is a key factor in the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity\u201d. We are counting on support for our initiative.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nThe Kyrgyz Republic attaches special importance to regional cooperation in Central Asia. Cooperation among our countries is developing dynamically. We actively participate in the regional dialogue platforms at the highest level to resolve existing issues. One of the main tasks is to remove barriers to economic cooperation in order to improve the well-being of our peoples. The development of a system of transport and communications corridors, logistics centres and terminals is vital. We must recreate the main routes of the ancient Great Silk Road. The construction and launch of the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railroad will be a meaningful contribution to connecting Asia with Europe.\nKyrgyzstan is committed to strengthening the rule of law and human rights. The strategic document that defines Kyrgyzstan\u2019s development path is its National Sustainable Development Strategy, covering the period until 2040. Its main thrust is the formation of a State governed by the rule of law and ensuring the rule of law in the interests of every citizen. With international support, we in Kyrgyzstan are conducting large-scale judicial reform.\nProjects on regional development, the provision of clean water and digitalization of public services are being successfully implemented. On 4 October this year, Kyrgyzstan will hold the next parliamentary elections. International observers, including those from the OSCE, the SCO and the CIS, have been invited to attend. We intend to make every effort to ensure that the elections are transparent and competitive and that we use modern technology.\nThank you for your attention."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nMr. Secretary General,\nYour Excellencies, Heads of State and Government,\nDistinguished Ladies and Gentlemen\nI congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the responsibility to steer the work of the Seventy-Fifth Session of the General Assembly and assure you of Sierra Leone\u2019s full support during your tenure.\nI commend His Excellency, Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande of Nigeria, for his effective and efficient leadership of the 74th UNGA session \u2014 a period that was very challenging.\nI commend Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his astute leadership and profound commitment to the work of the Organization. In particular, I acknowledge, with appreciation, his call for a global ceasefire during the current pandemic, the setting up of the COVID-19 response fund, advancing the urgent need to address Climate Change, and implementing the Sustainable Development Goals.\nFrom the outset, let me also, on behalf of the Government and People of Sierra Leone, express heartfelt and deep condolences to all Member States of the United Nations for the loss of lives due to the COVID-19 pandemics. We salute the selflessness of all frontline responders to this global emergency.\nI also applaud the adoption, by this Assembly and the Security Council, of various COVID-19-focused resolutions as well as initiatives by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres aimed at promoting global solidarity and cooperation to fight COVID-19 and address its impact on lives and livelihoods now and in the long term.\nSierra Leone, therefore, supports the call for global solidarity and cooperation for the prevention, curtailment, and treatment of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as all associated recovery programmes.\nTo that effect, I would like to encourage the Secretary General to work with this Assembly and all other stakeholders to expedite the implementation of all COVID- 19-related resolutions. I would also like to encourage Member States of this august Assembly to share relevant information, scientific knowledge, and best practices about the disease, as well as enhance equitable and fair access to medicines, vaccines and medical equipment to all nations.\nMr. President,\nGiven the global health pandemic, the theme for this session, \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism \u2014 confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action\u201d is therefore appropriate, relevant, and very timely.\nAs a global family, it is only through our collective commitment to Multilateralism that we can effectively tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and meaningfully address the prevailing universal challenges of poverty, hunger, diseases, natural disasters, climate change, terrorism, human rights violations, cybersecurity, and transnational organized crime.\nMr. President,\nAt a time when isolationist sentiments, geopolitical tensions, and economic uncertainties are escalating, the multilateral rules-based system is severely being tested. The UN Charter remains the foundation for that multilateral system, international cooperation, and global peace and security. It provides the framework for maintaining peace and security, upholding human rights and dignity, promoting sustainable development and international cooperation to tackle both longstanding and emerging challenges.\nIn view of this, Sierra Leone reaffirms its firm commitment to multilateralism as embodied in the Charter of the United Nations.\nWe are, in this regard, committed to promoting international cooperation to address present and emerging challenges that confront our world, including our collective engagement in the prevention of conflict as well as advancing durable peaceful settlement of conflicts and disputes.\nWe must continue to build on gains made in our preventive diplomacy efforts, continue to heighten collaboration, and utilise experiences that have helped the United Nations to achieve relative international peace and security over the last 75 years.\nMr President,\nThe Covid-19 pandemic continues to disrupt and destroy lives and livelihoods and also pose substantive risks to international peace and security. This is especially so in countries that are in conflict or emerging from conflict, those experiencing humanitarian crises, and those with weak and fragile economies where peacebuilding and post-war state-building could be undermined or reversed.\nThis brings me to the current political crisis in Mali and related insurgencies in the Sahel that are of grave concern and to which we should respond urgently by providing unambiguous support to ongoing efforts initiated by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).\nMr. President,\nOur collective multilateral aspiration and hope for a safer and more secure world is embodied in our adoption of the 2030 agenda and its 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs), the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, and the Paris Climate Change Agreement.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic makes our timely attainment of the objectives of the 2030 agenda unlikely, it is imperative that we respond cooperatively to the pandemic in a way that will put nations back on track to accelerate progress towards achieving the SDG. Reduced economic activity, revenue losses, budget constraints and the huge cost of managing the pandemic are adversely affecting our efforts to achieve sustainable development, strengthen resilience, and walk out of fragility.\nThe implementation of Sierra Leone\u2019s Medium-Term National Development Plan (2019-2023), that is aligned to both the SDGs and the AU\u2019s Agenda 2063, is faced with challenges of generating required domestic revenue to fund projects and other sundry capacity and management constraints. We must also strengthen our public health institutions, and where we rebuild, build back better.\nIn this regard, Sierra Leone fully supports current efforts by this Organization and International Financial Institutions, and continues to call for emergency debt relief and standstill mechanisms from International Financial Institutions.\nGiven the magnitude and impact of COVID-19 and other persistent disease burdens, we aim to invest in our health and other service delivery systems, and in a sustained and robust post COVID-19 recovery process. We therefore seek additional grants, access to finance and technical assistance from our development partners, and more budget support, to deliver that much-needed fiscal space.\nBut beyond short-term, quick-fix-and-exit-strategies that characterise this general global pandemic response, Africa needs a global commitment to Debt Cancellation for the least developed countries that are working hard to address longterm structural problems with their economies.\nMr. President,\nIn Sierra Leone, we believe that it will be impossible to make the necessary progress on global agendas such as education, health, gender equality, and climate change if we do not reduce inequality,violence, injustice, and corruption. Our Medium- Term NationalDevelopment Plan (2019-2023) prioritises Human DevelopmentCapital. We are therefore working to implement all critical drivers of sustainable development.\nThe empowerment of women and Girls is central to myGovernment\u2019s Medium-Term National Development Plan. We have established a standalone Ministry of Gender and Children\u2019s Affairs, developed a national Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment Policy, supporting entrepreneurship and economic inclusion,implementing affirmative policies for women and girls in all sectorsfrom education to agriculture, promoting women\u2019s health and reducing maternal and child mortality, toughening sexual offences laws, and introducing one stop centres for rape and sexual offences models courts.\nSince the launch of our country\u2019s free quality education flagship,we have increased allocations to 21 per cent of budget, increased enrolment at all educational institutions nationwide in spite of,and prioritised innovation and science in all aspects of governance and national development through the establishment of a Directorate for Science, Technology and Innovation that works closely with the Ministry of Technical and Higher Education.\nWe have increased investments in purposeful infrastructure that will generate economic productivity and improve standards of living. We are constructing and resurfacing more roads, expanding access to carbon-neutral energy in off-grid and other locations, extending ICT penetration, and improving access to potable water and sanitation facilities.\nWe have launched mitigation and protection strategies to forestall the adverse effects of climate change especially on our vulnerable populations. We urge more international cooperation and the urgent implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\nMr. President,\nAs Chair of the g7+ group of countries that brings together countries affected by conflict and fragility, Sierra Leone remains committed to fostering peaceful, just, and inclusive societies. Among local action Sierra Leone has taken to foster these goals are ramping up the fight against corruption and preparing to establish a permanent Commission on Peace and National Cohesion. Following a pledge I made at the 74th Session of this august body, we have now expunged a 55-year old law that criminalises seditious libel. We are working closely with journalists, civil society, women\u2019s groups, and other stakeholder groups to nurture and strengthen our democracy.\nWith the support of the Peacebuilding Commission, we have made great progress in fostering and sustaining peace in Sierra Leone over the years. Although Sierra Leone will withdraw from its formal agenda, we will continue to engage the Commission as and when the need arises.\nMr. President\nAt the World Summit held in 2005, we made a commitment to an early reform of the Security Council in order to make it \u201cmore broadly representative, efficient and transparent and thus to further enhance its effectiveness and the legitimacy and implementation of its decisions\u201d.\nAs Coordinator of the African Union Committee of Ten on the reform of the United Nations, I should underscore that the people of Africa are convinced now more than ever before that the present geopolitical realities and the current global health pandemic are compelling for a comprehensive reform of the Security Council to make way for the representation of Africa in the Permanent category and address its under-representation in the Non-Permanent category of the Council.\nThe growing and broad support for the Common African Position is evident in the recent intergovernmental negotiations as more Member States expressed and affirmed the call to correct the historical injustice done to Africa. In this vein, we would like to encourage this Assembly to address this long-standing injustice by adopting Africa\u2019s demand outlined in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. We look forward to constructive engagement that will build on progress made in the past in order to achieve the comprehensive reform of the Security Council during this session.\nMr. President,\nSierra Leone reiterates its commitment to multilateral efforts geared toward the total elimination of colonialism in all its forms and manifestation, and supports the adopted decade plan of action. If we are to remain true to the fundamental principles of the United Nations that is fit for purpose, then it becomes absolutely necessary to relegate the chapter of colonialism to history within the period 2021- 2030. The global paradigm of engagement, partnership, multilateralism, and mutual respect for the aspirations and views of all peoples must prevail.\nLet me conclude, Mr. President, by reiterating Sierra Leone\u2019s call for the establishment of resilient healthcare infrastructure and services to both curtail and protect people against the risk of COVID-19. Only in that way can the international community reestablish confidence and stability in the financial markets and create the right environment that supports global business and trade, investment, and job creation. We must put back on track progress toward achieving our sustainable development goals.\nI thank you!"

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nDistinguished Delegates,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nLet me begin by extending my warm congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Volkan Bozkir on his election as President of the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly.\nAs we speak today, the entire world is waging war against our common enemy, the COVID-19 global pandemic. This global pandemic has forced all of us to reassess our way of life as individuals and as communities and to reconsider our standard modes of operation. This 75th General Assembly is being held virtually. It is indeed humbling that an invisible virus has taken nearly one million lives, disrupted economies, livelihoods, and torn asunder the social fabric of peoples all over the world.\nThis global pandemic also lends itself as a test of the state of multilateralism. To overcome this pandemic an unprecedented scale of global cooperation is required. Therefore, it is only apt that this year\u2019s theme is \u201cThe Future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism \u2014 Confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action\u201d.\nRole of Multilateralism and the United Nations we want\nMr. President,\nIn a time of the greatest need for global cooperation, multilateralism has been placed itself under strain by the rise of unilateralism and protectionism. This has in some respects been worsened in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak by rising geopolitical rivalry and competition. This creates uncertainty. It is now, more than ever, that we need to strengthen rules-based multilateralism, to collectively overcome the exceptional challenges we face, and to mitigate their impact on weaker nations and vulnerable peoples. Failure to do so would impact the social stability of countries and place added burdens on the United Nations.\nDespite the worrisome trend of statements that undermine multilateralism, we fail to see an alternative to the United Nations. Indeed, we are not looking for one. The UN represents our joint efforts to improve the situation of hundreds of millions of human beings around the world through the promotion of peace and stability, sustainable development, a culture of justice, legality, and rule of law. Through effective multilateral actions, lives can be saved, health improved, and security experienced by many more.\nThis said, we need to work together to develop the United Nations into an organization that we all want. It must be an organization that nations can turn to in times of need. It must remain a true beacon of hope for developing countries.\nIn the area of human rights promotion and protection, the United Nations should ensure that its mandate holders adhere strictly to the principles of independence, impartiality and integrity in the exercise of their duties. It must avoid double standards scrupulously, in particular towards Member States that have to bear troublesome legacies, very often as a result of a colonial past. Equality of states must be respected, regardless of the extent of their material wealth and political influence.\nMyanmar and COVID-19\nMr. President,\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has overwhelmed even resource-rich countries. It represents a formidable task for a developing country like Myanmar. Myanmar has taken a Whole-of-Nation approach in mobilizing the strength of its people through volunteerism and sharing spirit in the fight against the pandemic.\nThese measures proved successful in coping with the first wave of the virus but at present we are facing the challenge of a second wave. The Government has been making parallel efforts both in protecting public health and mitigating the economic impact by implementing its COVID-19 Economic Recovery Plan (CERP). Despite the risk of virus import, we are bringing back all our citizens and migrant workers who are facing difficulties in foreign countries where they have no access to social protection.\nPursuing the principle of \u201cLeaving no one behind\u201d, Myanmar\u2019s response to the pandemic covers all vulnerable segments, especially IDPs, persons with disabilities, and low-income workers. To that end, the Government adopted an Action Plan for the control of COVID-19 at IDP camps that includes measures to raise awareness of the guidelines for pandemic prevention and to establish necessary measures to prevent and control the pandemic among internally displaced persons. To date those have been no serious outbreaks in any camp.\nPandemic and Conflict\nMr. President,\nTerrorism remains a global and transnational threat. In the interest of sustainable peace and stability, we need to continue to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. This is an absolute need that must not be allowed to be obfuscated by spurious issues. Conflict and insecurity negatively affect peace. Paving the road for sustainable development often requires a deep understanding of root causes and unconventional threats.We welcome the Secretary General\u2019s global ceasefire appeal which will contribute to peace and stability in conflict areas and encourage solidarity to overcome our common enemy, COVID-19. In response to this appeal, Tatmadaw, Myanmar\u2019s Armed Forces declared a ceasefire from 10 May to 31 August 2020. It also announced that the ceasefire will be applied in all areas except where terrorist groups have taken position. This ceasefire has been extended to 30 September 2020.\nThe Government has also invited all ethnic armed organizations to work together for the prevention of the spread of COVID-19 in those areas which are not yet under total Government control. This kind of cooperation contributes to confidence building between state institutions and the ethnic armed organizations. Despite the temporary disruption of commercial flights to Rakhine State, the Government continues to ensure health and humanitarian assistance to all affected communities without discrimination.\nMr. President\nIt has been a little over four years since the peaceful transfer of State responsibilities to the first elected civilian Government. This has ended over five decades of absolute military rule but it is only the beginning of our people\u2019s long journey towards a fully democratic Myanmar. We are treading carefully towards a different direction than known the past half a century. In just over a month from now, the people of Myanmar will go to the polls again. We have successfully put in place a political system that relies on ballots instead of bullets.\nEvery country undergoing democratic transition passes through difficult times. Myanmar is no exception. We are still struggling with numerous challenges including continued ethnic armed conflicts, old and new complex issues in Rakhine State, and, on top of it all, the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past four years, our Government has made an all-out effort within the space permitted by the 2008 Constitution to fulfill our people\u2019s dream of their inherent right to live in peace and security, with fundamental freedoms, and assured fruits of development. The people of Myanmar have started to enjoy the freedom of democratic rights but it is only when the existing 2008 Constitution can be revised, that we will be able to ensure the full democratic rights of our people. Although it is not possible to meet all the high expectations of all the people in such a short time, there are visible improvements in many areas including health, education, infrastructure, socioeconomic development, and good governance.\nPeace Process\nMr. President,\nIn a multi-ethnic country like Myanmar, making unity out of diversity is a great challenge. The Government is striving for sustainable peace, genuine national reconciliation and all-round development.\nIt is the aim of the NLD Government to hold political negotiations with all ethnic nationalities that we might bring the seven-decade history of internal strife to a conclusion and achieve durable peace. To that end, the Government has successfully convened four sessions of the Union Peace Conference, also known as the 21st Century Panlong Conference. As a result, the third part of the Union Accord, which includes basic guiding federal principles for the future of the Union, has been signed by the participating delegations. These principles will define the path that will be followed, regardless of which Government might be at the helm, towards the building of a Democratic Federal Union.\nRakhine State\nMr. President,\nWhen the NLD civilian Government took office in March 2016, it identified key priorities to be addressed. These included the complex situation of Rakhine State. Colonial cross-border migration and cycles of inter-communal violence have sowed deep-rooted mutual mistrust and fear between the different communities in Rakhine State.\nAcknowledging that a holistic and comprehensive approach was needed to ensure sustainable peace, in Rakhine State, the Central Committee for the Implementation of Peace, Stability, and Development in Rakhine State was established in May 2016. This effort was supplemented by the creation of the Advisory Commission under the late Dr. Kofi Annan, one time Secretary General of the UN, who has left us a legacy of 88 recommendations towards finding sustainable solutions to the demanding issues in Rakhine State.\nDespite the multiple challenges, the Government is committed to lay down a sustainable foundation for peace, stability, and development for all persons in Rakhine State. A ministerial level committee was set up to implement the recommendations of the Advisory Commission. This committee has selected five priority areas: issues of citizenship, freedom of movement, closure of IDP camps, education, and health care services. Its activities continue to the present day within the limitations of the COVID pandemic and the on-going internal armed conflict ignited by the Arakan Army (AA) in Rakhine State.\nDevelopments in Rakhine State\nMr. President,\nThe Government shares the concern of the international community over the situation in Rakhine, in particular the suffering of all communities affected by armed conflicts. To resolve the issue, our Government focused on the following areas: humanitarian situation, repatriation, resettlement, reconciliation, and development.\nHumanitarian Situation\nDespite the challenges posed by the internal armed conflicts in Rakhine State, the Government has scaled up its efforts to grant humanitarian access to International Organizations including the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to provide food and emergency items to affected persons in Rakhine and Chin States. The Government and the ICRC drew up an action plan to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 in Rakhine State, including in new and old Internally Displaced People\u2019s camps. The WFP has resumed regular distribution of food supplies and other activities such as nutrition interventions for vulnerable communities in Rakhine State. The people have benefitted from the generous support of the UN Country Team and other development partners in these efforts.\nBilateral Repatriation Process\nOur commitment to receive verified returnees in a voluntary, safe, and dignified manner under the bilateral agreement reached with Bangladesh in November 2017, remains steadfast. We invite the Government of Bangladesh to show its genuine political will to cooperate, by strictly adhering to the terms of the signed agreements. Bilateral cooperation is the only way that can effectively resolve the repatriation issue between Myanmar and Bangladesh. May I say this \u2014 Should Bangladesh commit itself to the bilateral process it will find Myanmar a willing partner. Pressure tactics will be futile. Myanmar does not react well to pressure. Myanmar\u2019s policy is to maintain friendly relations with all its five neighbours. We want to be good neighbours with Bangladesh, bound in a zero tolerance policy towards terrorism, not merely in words but in deeds. By so doing we will be upholding the national interests not just of our two countries but the region as a whole. Both the terrorist group ARSA and the terrorist insurgent group AA have used Bangladeshi territory as a sanctuary. Efforts to prevent ARSA and its supporters in the camps of Cox\u2019s Bazar from hampering the bilateral repatriation process, through threats, violence or other illegal conduct also need to be strengthened as such activities pose a risk to both Bangladesh and Myanmar.\nAlthough bilateral repatriation has not yet started, more than 350 displaced persons from Cox\u2019s Bazar camps have returned to Rakhine State on their own volition through unofficial channels.\nResettlement\nMyanmar is engaging with different actors in its efforts to create a conducive environment in Rakhine State for the prospective returnees from Bangladesh. In this regard, we have extended our trilateral agreement with the UNDP and UNHCR till June 2021 to facilitate the implementation of our bilateral agreements with Bangladesh.\nUNDP and UNHCR teams have worked independently to assess immediate needs in over 120 villages. The Government has approved 75 \u2018Quick Impact Projects\u2019 (QIPs), as termed by the UN, relating to community infrastructure, skills training, and income-generation. With the advent of the pandemic, their efforts are now naturally focussed on raising awareness of COVID-19 prevention within the communities.\nThe Government is also working with ASEAN\u2019s Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management (AHA Centre). At the time of repatriation, the ASEAN assessment team will be in the field to assess the process. This should enhance the trust and confidence of the returnees. In July this year, Myanmar and ASEAN identified and endorsed four joint projects: 1) improving access to information to facilitate the repatriation process; 2) capacity-building for the verification process at the reception centers; 3) provision of agriculture equipment; and 4) livelihood-recovery programme.\nAccountability and Reconciliation\nMr. President,\nWe share the concern over the allegations of human rights violations in Rakhine State and take them seriously. During the public hearing before the International Court of Justice in December 2019, the State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi reaffirmed that if war crimes or human rights violations have been committed, they will be investigated and prosecuted by Myanmar\u2019s criminal justice system. This is our right, our obligation and our commitment, and it is important for vital domestic processes linked to constitutional reform and peace in Myanmar.\nIn pursuit of accountability, the Government established the Independent Commission of Enquiry (ICoE) in July 2018, which submitted its final report to the President in January 2020. Based on these findings, the Union Attorney General is conducting ongoing investigations of allegations against civilian perpetrators.\nFurthermore, the Office of the Judge Advocate General (JAG) announced on 15 September 2020 that a third court-martial concerning alleged human rights violations in Rakhine in 2017 will start before the end of 2020. It concerns the villages of Chut Pyin and Maung Nu. The State Counsellor mentioned in her statement before the International Court of Justice in December 2019 that events in these two villages were among the 12 most serious incidents in Rakhine in 2016-2017. The ICoE final report identified them as the gravest on its list of 12-13 incidents. This is also alleged by United Nations and civil society reports. It is therefore significant that there will be a court-martial for these incidents as it confirms Myanmar has the will to ensure accountability for the most serious allegations.\nEarlier, the two court-martials concerning Inn Din and Gutarpyin saw the conviction of 13 officers and soldiers, for crimes in two villages on the list of 12 serious incidents mentioned by the State Counsellor. Let me repeat her statement of regret at the early release of those convicted in the Inn Din case. I am confident that in subsequent cases there will be no such premature release of convicted persons. With a third court-martial, we could see within the next several months an increase in the total number of officers and soldiers convicted for Rakhine 2017 crimes. In this century, there are very few countries that hold their own officers and soldiers accountable for international crimes even in conflict which has seen a much higher number of deaths than the internal armed conflict in Rakhine.\nIt is noteworthy that the Judge Advocate General of Myanmar will not stop with the third case. In his announcement on 15 September 2020, he also stated that an investigation of possible wider patterns of violations in the region of northern Rakhine in 2016-2017 has started. Such alleged regional patterns of conduct could include, for example,\n\u201cinadequate distinction between civilians and ARSA fighters, disproportionate use of force, [...] failure to prevent plundering or property destruction, or acts of forcible displacement of civilians\u201d.\nThese possible patterns of conduct across northern Rakhine in 2016-2017 are now subject to the new, regional investigation, based on the three above-mentioned cases, the ICoE final report, and other information. This represents highly significant progress in the domestic accountability process.\nA country should be given time, space and respect for its domestic accountability processes. Independent experts have pointed out to the risks of \u201cdemonization and one-sidedness\u201d in the way some international actors swiftly reject any step Myanmar takes towards domestic accountability. One international lawyer politely asked whether such automatic rejection of domestic justice steps is \u201cindicative of objectivity, lack of bias, and concern to nourish domestic justice efforts\u201d, or is it perhaps exactly the opposite? Demonization not only undermines our investigators and prosecutors. As the State Counsellor observed before the International Court of Justice last December:\n\u201cFeeding the flames of an extreme polarisation in the context of Rakhine [...] can harm the values of peace and harmony in Myanmar. Aggravating the wounds of conflict can undermine unity in Rakhine. Hate narratives are not simply confined to hate speech \u2014 language that contributes to extreme polarisation also amounts to hate narratives\u201d.\nIssuance of three Presidential Directives\nMr. President,\nIn April this year, the Presidential Office issued a directive to Government officials to act in compliance of its treaty obligations under the Genocide Convention. Another directive was also issued to prohibit officials from destroying or removing any evidence of possible crimes relating to the above-mentioned criminal investigations. A third directive was issued to all Government officials to denounce and prevent all forms of hate speech and to participate in and support anti-hate speech activities. Anti-hate speech awareness campaigns are being implemented nationwide. In May this year, anti-hate speech activities led by civil society organisations, women and youth were carried out simultaneously in all townships in Rakhine State. More activities will take place in the coming months. The Election Commission and the Ministry of Information are working together with UNDP and UNESCO in an antihate speech programme.\nSocial Cohesion\nMr. President,\nMyanmar has expended sustained efforts to foster social cohesion among the communities residing in Rakhine State to bring about reconciliation. It is our sincere hope that these social cohesion activities will bring the communities together and rebuild trust and confidence. Despite persistent opposition to the Government\u2019s effort to achieve social harmony and reconciliation in Rakhine State from some actors both outside and inside the country, we are determined to persevere.\nTogether with our civil society partners, various activities have taken place to promote mutual understanding and respect among the communities. So far, 203 community dialogues have been conducted, while respecting social distancing rules and other necessary precautions linked to the COVID pandemic. The success of these community dialogues and activities augurs well for reconciliation and peace in Rakhine State.\nFour youth camps have been held. Over 265 campaign activities to raise awareness of COVID-19 prevention measures have taken place in Rakhine State. Other activities in Rakhine include 17 anti-hate speech events, 3 gender-based violence awareness events, 5 community environmental campaigns, and 10 anti-drug campaigns. In addition, 28 training sessions on social cohesion, civic education, social mobilization, conflict analysis, managing rumours and hate messages, have been organized. Furthermore, 155 vocational training programmes have been conducted whereby the communities were involved in producing facemasks and hand sanitizers. These activities created jobs for more than 5,000 people in Rakhine State. It has been said, \u201cNothing brings people together more than a World Cup\u201d. In that spirit, we are pleased that 3 sports tournaments have taken place.\nAll communities in Rakhine State have participated in vocational training programmes offered by the UN such as tailoring, mechanics and livestock breeding. All communities also participated in \u201ccash for work\u201d infrastructure development projects, such as improvement of village roads, water ponds and school renovation.\nAddressing sexual violence\nMyanmar has signed a Joint Communique with the UN on the prevention and response to conflict-related sexual violence in December 2018. A National Committee was established and has developed an Action Plan to identify priority implementation areas such as the issuance of clear directives by the military, investigation of alleged violations, prosecution of perpetrators, capacity-building of law enforcement officers, legal reform measures, and strengthening of service delivery for survivors. Furthermore, the Government is drafting a law on the \u201cPrevention and Protection of Violence against Women\u201d to reinforce the protection of women from all forms of violence including domestic and sexual violence.\nPrevention of Grave Violations against Children\nThe Government has established the National Committee on the Prevention of Grave Violations against Children in Armed Conflict and formulated the National Action Plan for protecting children in armed conflicts from injury, death, and sexual violence. This Action Plan was approved by the President\u2019s Office in August this year, and in line with the work plan, the military will issue necessary directives, and set up a complaints mechanism, and a monitoring and evaluation committee. Myanmar is cooperating with UNICEF to conduct awareness-raising activities. In June this year, the UN delisted Myanmar\u2019s army from the list of countries that recruit child soldiers for combat purposes.\nDevelopment\nTo tackle poverty in Rakhine State, a Rakhine State Investment Fair was held in February 2019. This event is expected to generate job opportunities, income, and long-term development. Other development projects are being considered but these initiatives have been put on hold due to the armed conflicts and the pandemic.\nConclusion\nMr. President,\nMyanmar reaffirms its commitment to continue to work constructively with the United Nations in line with our national priorities and needs, particularly in our endeavors to achieve the goals set out in the Myanmar Sustainable Development Plan.\nIn our democratic journey, we have achieved much progress but it is far from over. Our progress is due to the resilience of our people and their strong will to build prosperity and well being for all in Myanmar. We are nurturing and building a new nation together. We would like to thank our friends far and near who have offered us their understanding and support during difficult times. We sincerely value their friendship.\nThis brings me to my conclusion. In May 2019, the UN released its strategy and plan of action against hate speech. This must be lauded as there is a dire need to address hate speech domestically. But we should also be aware of the international dimension, as referred to earlier. Demonization may be the oldest propaganda technique. It seeks to inspire ill-feeling towards the designated enemy, the \u2018other\u2019, to rally allies to impose an arbitrary agenda that is removed from basic norms of justice.. It is of the utmost importance that those entrusted with UN human rights mandates observe the highest standards of quality control and integrity, and that they do not cut corners to please any constituency. Grave accusations have been made against Myanmar. Such accusations have not been subjected to due process, including judicial probing of real evidence, yet the verdict of \u2018guilty\u2019 seems to have been passed by some in the international community. Demonizing fellow Member States of the United Nations, by using inadequately quality-controlled information, fosters ill-feeling between countries and peoples, which is the harbinger of hatred and conflict. This would weaken the principal objectives of peace on which the United Nations Charter is based.\nWe ask only for fair treatment from the international community. It is our appeal to the Member States to examine the negative narratives on Myanmar carefully and impartially, before drawing their independent conclusions. We would appreciate it if the international community continues to extend its support and understanding to our efforts towards the achievement of sustainable peace and national reconciliation, genuine democracy, and inclusive development for all peoples in Myanmar.\nI thank you, Mr. President."

        "file_text": "At the outset, I would like congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fifth session. We also commend the outstanding work of the outgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, who contributed to advancing the Organization through his wisdom and leadership during the difficult time that we are going through. I would also like to reaffirm our confidence in and pay tribute to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for the skill with which he is pursuing our shared goals.\nWhen it comes to an end, the year 2020 will undoubtedly be seen as one of the most difficult in history in terms of the public-health crisis brought about by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has spread all over the world, causing untold human suffering. It has exposed many unforeseen vulnerabilities among the international community while causing an unprecedented economic crisis. While we are deliberating here in the Assembly we are still searching for a lasting cure for this plague. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the memory of all the victims of the virus and to commend the extraordinary work of the healthcare workers from every country who have saved millions of lives.\nThis session is therefore taking place in an extremely unusual context in which our world is more disrupted than ever. The human tragedy that is the result is putting multilateralism to the test and urging us to act resolutely together to halt this scourge. That is why I welcome the choice of theme for this session of the General Assembly, \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism \u2014 addressing Covid-19 through effective multilateral action\u201d. In many ways, the theme is emblematic of the overall environment of anxiety, which compels us to be united in solidarity and more determined. The COVID-19 pandemic requires immense sacrifices of us, and our success in halting the crisis will depend on our willingness to unite our efforts to counter the pandemic and prevent our populations from falling back into extreme poverty. It is an unfortunate fact that the COVID-19 pandemic has slowed our efforts to meet several Sustainable Development Goals, including in the areas of health, hunger and decent work. It is therefore imperative that the international community adopt a concerted, global and coherent approach to respond appropriately to the pandemic. In that regard, I commend the initiative of the Secretary-General who, from the very beginning of the pandemic, launched a global response by the United Nations system to address the pandemic and guide our States to safeguard themselves against the adverse consequences of the pandemic.\nIt has been established that owing to the virus\u2019s highly contagious nature, the preventive measures that we are taking today will not be sufficient on their own to counter and eventually eliminate it. Vaccination therefore continues to be the lasting solution. In that regard, my country encourages all the research that is under way throughout the world to achieve that goal. Although it is promising, we are already dealing with the issue of access to future vaccines. While it is true that pharmaceutical companies are committing enormous financial resources to that end, we must not sacrifice our humanity to economic profit. We will therefore need to ensure that access to any future COVID-19 vaccine is equitable, affordable and not subject to market forces. Accordingly, I welcome the adoption of resolution WHA73.1 by the General Assembly of the World Health Organization (WHO), pursuant to which Member States have provided that full access to any such vaccine and other related medicines shall be timely, equitable, of high quality, safe and affordable for all. My country also welcomes the COVAX Facility initiative launched by WHO \u2014 a mechanism for the group purchase of eventual COVID-19 vaccines, coordinated by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization \u2014 which will guarantee every participating country fair and equitable access to vaccines through an allocation framework that WHO intends to set up.\nThe African continent, which is confronting the cruelty of poverty and endemic and cyclical natural scourges, is also seeing a worrying spread of the disease. In order to counter that, the African Union has implemented a control-and-prevention strategy, recommended by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the cost of whose implementation alone is estimated at more than $200 billion. It has also established the African Medical Supplies Platform to improve the provision of COVID-19-related medical equipment and supplies, access to which has become increasingly difficult owing to the strong market demand. In that regard, I welcome the partnership between the United Nations and the African Union to address the challenges posed by the pandemic. My country believes that the Secretary-General\u2019s call to the leaders of the Group of 20 to adopt a recovery plan for developing countries, as well as calls for debt suspension and cancellation, will result in action being taken.\nIn the framework of its COVID-19 response, after our first case of the disease was diagnosed, on 6 March, Togo set up a crisis committee, personally chaired by the President of the Republic, a national coordination response, a management committee and a scientific committee. In view of the disease\u2019s long-term socioeconomic impact, my Government has also launched a national solidarity and economic recovery fund totalling 400 billion CFA francs, or approximately $665 million. The measures taken involve prevention through social distancing, case detection, the compulsory wearing of masks and education and awareness-raising among the population. We have also shut down various areas of the country, established a curfew, closed borders, schools and universities and banned gatherings.\nWith regard to health care, the Government has opened dedicated centres in Lome and in each of the country\u2019s economic regions, trained personnel and supplied critical laboratory, medical and protective equipment. The scientific committee has developed a treatment plan. We have taken various social measures for the benefit of the population, particularly the most vulnerable sectors, in order to mitigate the impact of the pandemic \u2014 reducing the costs of water and electricity, removing taxes on basic needs, providing food distribution and subsidizing the most disadvantaged citizens through the Novissi cash transfer programme, and, lastly, supporting businesses. We would therefore like to take this opportunity to express our sincere thanks to our various partners and all who are assisting Togo in the fight against the pandemic.\nAs we commemorate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations this year, it is fitting to note that our institution has made great progress in the areas of peacebuilding, respect for human rights and the promotion of truly sustainable development, despite the prejudices that have to be overcome. One of the Organization\u2019s major achievements is in the area of the promotion of peace and security, with peacekeeping operations that have helped to save many lives and restore stability and security in a world plagued by conflicts and emerging threats such as terrorism and violent extremism. Our peacekeeping operations, in which as one of the major troop-contributing countries Togo is an active participant, have been enhanced and improved over time. This is the right occasion to welcome the fact that they are moving resolutely and increasingly towards a preventive and multidimensional approach.\nIn the area of development, the Organization\u2019s adoption in 2015 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is still so far the most ambitious tool for ensuring our peoples\u2019 welfare. The 2030 Agenda, which capitalizes on the experience gained from the Millennium Development Goals, integrates the three dimensions of sustainable development \u2014 economic, social and environmental \u2014 in a crosscutting approach. The Organization has also excelled in promoting human rights. International human rights standards have accordingly flourished in various areas, especially with regard to women and children.\nHowever, such successes here and there must not blind us to the fact that the Organization is still facing many other challenges. Only active international cooperation and international solidarity can help us deal with them effectively and successfully. We have not yet banished the spectre of war and armed conflicts in all their forms. And nowadays such conflicts have taken on a new form, driven by non- State actors and amorphous networks that fuel terrorism and religious extremism, including in the countries of the Sahel region and Central Africa. Moreover, climate change, especially the destructive weather events that we have recently seen in Africa, and the migration crisis are challenges that the Organization must meet with bold and sustainable responses if it is to achieve the ideals it was founded on.\nOur peoples\u2019 expectations are high and pressing, and my country urges all States to assume their responsibility to meet them and commit to taking action, which, to be blunt, entails revitalizing and reforming our Organization, particularly its principal organs, including the Security Council, in order to make it more representative and better adapted to the demands of our time. We firmly believe that greater transparency, justice, equity and democracy, with strict respect for the sovereign equality and dignity of States, particularly in Africa, will enable the Organization to write a new chapter in its existence. To that end, we must not give in to the temptation of turning inwardly as nations. Let us rather move forward together and united in the hope of the peace and development to which our peoples remain firmly committed."

All the delegations gathered in that imposing hall during the General Debate. The whole world coming together.\nThere\u2019s nothing like it.\nBut this year, everything is different.\nFor the first time in history we\u2019re having a virtual Assembly.\nIt feels a bit surreal, and it\u2019s far from ideal, but it\u2019s important \u2014 despite the restrictions \u2014 that we share our views on the international situation.\nEspecially this year.\nBecause this is the year of coronavirus.\nThe impact on our health, our economies and our societies has been enormous.\nAlmost every country in the world, including the European and Caribbean parts of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, has been hit hard.\nThe poorest countries hardest of all.\nExisting problems have been magnified by the pandemic.\nAnd this has forced us to face facts: in times of crisis we have to work together.\nLook out for each other.\nSupport one another.\nNot only our families, neighbours and compatriots, but also other countries and peoples, regardless of the borders between us.\nBecause we\u2019re all in this together.\nThe UN is setting the right example.\nNot least by setting up the UN COVID-19 Response and\nRecovery Fund, initiated by Secretary-General Guterres.\nThe Netherlands fully supports the Fund, and so far we\u2019re its biggest donor.\nThe World Bank and the IMF are also helping the countries most affected.\nThese are fine examples of international solidarity that bode well for the future.\nBut if we\u2019re truly going to defeat this virus we\u2019ll have to do even more to enhance international cooperation.\nIt starts with supporting the World Health Organization, which plays a crucial role.\nWe must provide the resources it needs.\nIt also means countries need to give the Organization full cooperation and show transparency.\nIn some cases this has been lacking.\nAt the same time, the WHO has also attracted criticism.\nThe Netherlands agrees that \u2014 once the crisis is under control \u2014 we should evaluate the situation and look at how we can enhance its powers.\nSo that we\u2019re well-equipped to deal with \u2014 or better still prevent \u2014 any future pandemic.\nCritical evaluation and continuous efforts to improve are key elements of multilateral cooperation.\nBut unfortunately, as we mark the UN\u2019s 75th anniversary, we\u2019re also seeing another trend.\nThe multilateral world order, which has given us so much in the decades since World War Two, is under great pressure.\nAnd we need to turn this tide.\nStep one is for all countries to take responsibility for the proper functioning of the multilateral system.\nTake a constructive approach.\nStand up for your own interests, but don\u2019t lose sight of the common interest.\nAnd last but not least, honour the agreements we\u2019ve made and respect international law, including human rights.\nWhen it comes to multilateralism, you can\u2019t pick and choose.\nStep two is to critically assess the system itself.\nBecause there\u2019s work to be done there too.\nWe can\u2019t tackle today\u2019s challenges with yesterday\u2019s structures.\nIt\u2019s essential that we improve, reform and modernise our global institutions.\nAnd the UN is no exception.\nDuring our recent membership of the UN Security Council, the Netherlands worked hard on practical UN reforms in the area of peacekeeping.\nAnd we fully support the broad reform agenda of SecretaryGeneral Guterres.\nTogether we need to ensure that the UN \u2014 now 75 years old \u2014 remains fit for purpose, well-equipped and young at heart.\nThat it\u2019s ready for the next 75 years.\nBecause the new generations, who are already making their voices heard, must be able to count on a solid global system of multilateral cooperation.\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands will keep working towards that end, in every way possible.\nBy providing financial resources, for example: we are one of the ten biggest donors to the multilateral system and we try to play a constructive role.\nBut also by sharing our expertise in areas like climate adaptation.\nA topic that\u2019s in the very DNA of our Kingdom, which is made up of a low- lying delta by the North Sea and several small islands in the Caribbean.\nIn January 2021, we will be hosting the Climate Adaptation Summit to help the world prepare better for the effects of climate change.\nAnother contribution we make is providing a base for the international legal order.\nMy home town of The Hague is host to the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court, for example.\nWe must continue supporting these crucial institutions.\nEven though it\u2019s become harder and harder in recent years to achieve accountability, due mainly to resistance from a small number of countries.\nBut we won\u2019t let that stop us.\nWe will find other ways.\nLike the international mechanism for collecting and analysing evidence of the most serious crimes committed in Syria.\nOr the step the Netherlands recently took, holding Syria formally responsible for human rights violations.\nAnd for our country in particular, the establishment of special court proceedings to try those accused of downing flight MH17 was a major milestone.\nBecause justice must be served.\nAnd because justice is a central pillar of our multilateral world order.\nWe work in all these areas, in the full conviction that international cooperation brings us progress.\nAnd although the current crisis forces us to keep our distance, now more than ever we need to come closer together.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "Mr President,\nThis is an historic and unusual gathering of our General Assembly.\nWe gather not in the great city of New York, but from among our people, from across the nations of the earth, as together we face the same storm.\nA global pandemic that has claimed the lives of at least 1 million souls that we know of and has plunged our world into a global economic recession.\nThese events reminds us of our shared humanity, our interdependence and, indeed, the value of our common hope.\nTo get an education, a job, a livelihood.\nTo be safe, healthy and free.\nTo live in a clean and unpolluted environment.\nIn such times of crisis, there is actually an opportunity for our shared humanity to overwhelm the differences that usually beset us and to focus once again on pursuing our common hope. Which is why we gather.\nI speak to you today from Sydney, Australia\u2019s largest city and the ancient home of the Gadigal people.\nOne of Australia\u2019s many Indigenous peoples who have cared for our continent for more than 60,000 years. The world\u2019s oldest continuous living indigenous culture, and so I acknowledge their elders past, present and future as I make these remarks from Sydney today.\nAustralia is contending with this storm of the global COVID-19 pandemic and recession with great determination.\nOur aim is simple, to deny the virus the destruction it seeks to visit upon us, upon our lives and our livelihoods.\nSadly, over 800 Australians have lost their lives to COVID-19. But in comparative terms we have fared better than most and we are grateful for that.\nOur COVID-19 case and fatality rates are a fraction of those across the globe.\nAnd while our economy has not been spared the blow of recession, our first in almost 30 years in Australia, the impact has been far less than almost every other developed economy in the world.\nAlmost half the jobs that we had lost to the virus early on have been already recovered. Australia is getting on with the job.\nOur national COVIDSafe action plan has been straight forward.\nSecure our borders early and consistently.\nEntrench COVIDSafe behaviours in our community and in our economy.\nSocial distancing, mask use and sanitation measures, to deny the virus the opportunity to move amongst us.\nTo build and ensure strong testing, tracing, and outbreak containment capabilities, shutting the virus down, before it can take hold.\nInvesting in our hospitals and our medical supplies to ensure the virus does not overwhelm our health system.\nAnd to provide an economic lifeline to millions of Australians, their families and businesses, who have lost jobs and livelihoods as a result of the recession with income and investment supports worth more than 15 per cent of our GDP.\nOur approach, though we have been tested, has saved lives and livelihoods and has protected, as best as we have been able to, our most vulnerable.\nAnd we have done this consistent with our principles as an open, liberal democracy, respecting the dignity of each and every individual, every citizen, every life.\nIn Australia, we have also been mindful of our wonderful Pacific family during this pandemic, our wantoks, our vuvale, our whanau, particularly the island nations of the South West Pacific.\nAustralia is the single largest development partner for these nations.\nSo we\u2019ve provided personal protective equipment, testing equipment, medical expertise, and we\u2019re maintaining an essential services and humanitarian corridor so experts and supplies can get in and out.\nIn Southeast Asia, we\u2019re also providing much-needed equipment and expertise, as well as supporting collaboration to develop a vaccine.\nAnd we\u2019ve contributed $80 million to the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment.\nWhen it comes to a vaccine, Australia\u2019s view is very clear.\nWhoever finds the vaccine must share it.\nThis is a global responsibility, and it\u2019s a moral responsibility, for a vaccine to be shared far and wide.\nSome might see short term advantage, or even profit.\nBut I assure you to anyone who may think along those lines, humanity will have a very long memory and be a very, very severe judge.\nAustralia\u2019s pledge is clear: if we find the vaccine we will share it.\nThat\u2019s the pledge we all must make.\nAt home, our Australian efforts are about producing and providing a vaccine to our citizenry, sovereignly produced, once a vaccine is safely available and we\u2019ve invested $1.7 billion in that task.\nAnd that includes being committed to ensuring our neighbours in the Pacific and other parts of South East Asia can also access a safe, effective and affordable vaccine.\nThe World Health Organization has a vital role, ensuring that if and when there is a vaccine, people around the world can get access it.\nAustralia supports the WHO\u2019s efforts to develop a global framework so that vaccines and therapeutics are allocated fairly.\nIn facing a global health threat, we have all been reminded about the importance of multilateral cooperation.\nAnd I acknowledge the efforts of the WHO in containing the spread of the virus, including in the Indo-Pacific region.\nI\u2019m pleased that the WHO has established an independent panel to evaluate the global response.\nThere is also a clear mandate to identify the zoonotic source of the COVID-19 virus and how it was transmitted to humans.\nAustralia strongly advocated for this review.\nThis virus has inflicted a calamity on our world and its peoples. We must do all we can to understand what happened for no other purpose than to prevent it from happening again.\nWhen the resolution was put to the World Health Assembly in May, a record 145 countries were co-sponsors.\nAnd as we try to control the spread of COVID-19, we also need to shine a spotlight on the dangers of disinformation.\nDisinformation costs lives, and creates a climate of fear and division.\nIt goes against Australia\u2019s values and beliefs as a free, open society.\nSo we recently worked through the United Nations to co-author a statement countering widespread disinformation, one signed by more than 120 countries.\nI acknowledge the other UN bodies that are also making vital contributions.\nThe World Food Programme is transporting much-needed medical equipment and humanitarian supplies across the globe.\nAnd the UN Development Programme is sending food into nations in dire need.\nIn fact, the UN is fulfilling its high purpose, the purpose that 75 years ago brought the world together in a united hope, and in goodwill.\nMr President, 75 years is a remarkable milestone.\nOf course, much has changed since 1945.\nWhen the UN Charter was signed, 51 countries were listed.\nAustralia was proud to be one of them and we are proud of the role we have played since then within the UN, to the present day.\nToday, there are 193 UN member states.\nThat\u2019s a good thing.\nMore voices. More ideas. More partners.\nBut with more voices and challenges comes complexity, negotiation, processes, bureaucracy that would test any organisation.\nAt 75, we know that the UN, like the humanity it serves, the nations that form it, are not perfect.\nSo against this backdrop, we should think about what the next 75 years look like for the UN, its structures, its functions and for multilateralism more generally.\nWe want these multilateral institutions to continue to deliver for us and all nations.\nSo we\u2019re committed to ensuring they are fit for purpose, that they\u2019re effective, that they\u2019re open and transparent and, most importantly, that they are accountable to the sovereign states that form them.\nThe UN is its members, not its committees, processes, institutions or officials.\nIts authority and efficacy is derived from the free participation, contributions, cooperation and collaboration of the sovereign states that comprise the United Nations, in a common purpose, to pursue our common hope.\nWe know that sovereignty doesn\u2019t mean turning inwards though.\nWe value rules that protect sovereignty, peace and security, and curb the excessive use of power.\nAs Australians we also prize respect for international law and the peaceful resolution of disputes through dialogue.\nThis includes ensuring that competing territorial and maritime claims are based on, and determined in line with, international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\nAs an outward-looking, sovereign, trading nation, Australia also values the rules and institutions that enable international trade.\nWe know that trade creates wealth and brings nations together. It makes us more prosperous, all of us.\nWe won\u2019t retreat into the downward spiral of protectionism in Australia.\nSo we\u2019re leading efforts to reform the World Trade Organization.\nWe\u2019re advocating for trade rules that are predictable, transparent and non-discriminatory.\nWe\u2019re helping to design the first-ever set of global digital trade rules so we keep pace with modern realities.\nAnd we\u2019re working hard to preserve crucial elements of the WTO\u2019s dispute settlement system so trade rules can continue to be enforced.\nAustralia also relies heavily on the international standards that UN technical bodies set, especially in areas like aviation, telecommunications, and health.\nThese issues are vital to all of our prosperity, and we want to play a bigger role alongside business and civil society in setting relevant and efficient standards.\nWe need to make sure these standards serve all countries rather than any single power, and that they are developed in line with the fundamental principles of the global order.\nAustralia is helping to shape the norms for other emerging issues, also.\nLike ensuring states abide by agreed rules in cyber space, maintaining a peaceful outer space, and managing critical minerals resources.\nAustralia is also committed to ongoing counter-proliferation efforts.\nWe played a major role in negotiating the establishment of the\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization in the 1980s and 1990s, and we see it as a critical pillar of international peace and security today.\nAs signatories to the Kyoto and Paris Accords we are reducing our carbon emissions, effectively. Most recently Australia beat our Kyoto target commitments by 430 million tonnes of C02 abatement.\nBetween 2017 and mid-2020, more than $30 billion was invested in renewables in Australia.\nIn 2019 we saw investment at more than three times, in renewables than the per capita rate of countries like Germany, China, or France.\nAcross 2019 and 2020, Australia will add more than 12.6 GW of renewable capacity, now that\u2019s over four times that of our largest power station in Australia. And nearly one in four households have rooftop solar systems.\nAs a liberal democracy, we\u2019re also committed to promoting universal values like human rights, gender equality and the rule of law.\nWe\u2019ve always believed in these values, it\u2019s what makes us who we are.\nAustralia was one of only eight countries involved in drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We\u2019re proud of that role.\nAnd today, we\u2019re serving as a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council.\nWe\u2019re the first country from the Pacific region to serve on that body.\nOur term ends this year, and we\u2019re pleased to have served but I\u2019m proud that we\u2019ve raised our voice and been heard on important issues like the rights of women and girls, the rights of Indigenous peoples, and the global abolition of the death penalty.\nAustralia will continue to bring its influence to bear to make sure it responds to the interests of its members and the needs of our time.\nMr President, 1945 was a defining year in human history.\nThe year the Second World War ended.\nThe year the United Nations was founded.\nIt was a year when humanity found hope amidst despair.\nThis year is one of the hardest since then.\nSo let our resolve now also be undiminished as it was at the beginning of the United Nations as we commit again, together, to realising the common hope that binds us all together."

        "file_text": "I have the honour to orally present a written address by His Excellency Mr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President of the Republic of Uganda, to the general debate of the General Assembly at its seventy-fifth session.\n\u201cI wish to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fifth session, and to assure you of Uganda\u2019s full support. I would like to thank His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad- Bande for his exceptional leadership of the Assembly at its seventy-fourth session, particularly during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic period. I would also like to pay tribute to the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, for his dedication and commitment to the work of the United Nations, and to express my solidarity to all countries that are fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and my condolences for the lives they have lost.\n\u201cUganda welcomes the theme of the seventy-fifth session of the General Assembly. The United Nations is a fitting forum for speaking with one voice on the global pandemic. This session is a timely reminder of the vision, shared principles and commitments agreed on at our sustainable development summit, held in New York from 25 to 27 September 2015 (see A/70/PV.4). When we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we pledged to ensure that no one would be left behind by taking explicit action to end extreme poverty and curb inequalities. As we celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, we therefore need an Organization that is fit for the purpose of addressing global challenges. It is through effective multilateral action that we can mitigate the multifaceted impacts of the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis and accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In that connection, Uganda reiterates its commitment to multilateralism. We see multilateralism as a means to address complex and newly emerging threats and challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected every member of the international community in an increasingly interdependent world.\n\u201cUganda, like many countries around the world, has had to respond to the onslaught of the pandemic. We viewed COVID-19 as a fearless foe of human life that had to be confronted. Our approach to dealing with it prioritized the protection of human lives. As a first pragmatic step to ensure that the country responded adequately and mitigated the impact of the pandemic, the Government developed guidelines and standard operating procedures to align and standardize its response. We combined systematic testing, tracing, quarantining and treatment with restrictions on movement and contact, aiming to suppress transmission of the virus. We combined all of those measures with a widespread media campaign to sensitize the public. The Government has also continued to strengthen its national health system as part of its commitment to universal health coverage and to ensuring that health facilities handling COVID-19 patients are well equipped with the necessary supplies in order to support efficient and effective case management. Through those deliberate and targeted decisions, Uganda has been able to prevent mass coronavirus infections within the country. The Government has also prioritized sustainable recovery from the pandemic in its national COVID-19 response strategy.\n\u201cIn addition to its incalculable health and human toll, the pandemic has left an indelible mark on the global economy. Across the world, countries are suffering from the sudden shock to their economies. But beyond the immediate challenges of the current crisis, there is a need for a greater focus on recovery from the epidemic. The impact of COVID-19 can be mitigated if we act immediately and collectively. We applaud the efforts of various international and regional organizations, such as the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, the African Union (AU), the Commonwealth, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the East African Community (EAC), among others, in dealing with the pandemic.\n\u201cWe commend the international community for the support it has given so far in dealing with the pandemic. The decisions in April of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank Group, and the Group of 20 to immediately suspend 76 countries\u2019 debt-service payments for one year was laudable. However, the agreed suspension of debt is not enough to ensure that they can respond and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic or navigate its devastating social and economic effects. We call for more action on comprehensive debt- relief packages, particularly debt cancellations by multilateral and bilateral creditors, in order to enable us to obtain the funding we need for our COVID-19 pandemic response.\n\u201cI am glad to inform Member States that key sectors of Uganda\u2019s economy, especially agriculture and information and communications technology, have endured through the COVID-19 pandemic. Production levels increased, exceeding pre-COVID-19 levels. Coffee exports continued to surge despite the coronavirus pandemic, with the figures for April 2020 showing growth compared with the previous year. Uganda has been able to stand up and weather the storm because of the appropriate actions we took as a Government, including pursuing the right policy on promoting private- sector-led growth.\n\u201cThe COVID-19 crisis has taught us a few lessons and shown us areas for reflection. First, it demonstrates how interconnected and interdependent our world has become. Secondly, we have seen that we must embrace the digital age and adopt more digital technologies for both production and services, such as banking, retailing and learning, as well as public services. Thirdly, many industries and institutions have shown the ability to adapt and redirect themselves. In Uganda, for instance, clothing factories are making masks, universities have started making ventilators and sugar refineries are manufacturing hand sanitizers.\n\u201cUganda has demonstrated its commitment to scale up national efforts towards the realization of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. In the wake of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we realize now more than ever the need to remain focused on critical efforts to achieve the overarching Sustainable Development Goal of eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions and spur socioeconomic and political development.\n\u201cProgress has been registered in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as reflected in our second voluntary national review report, which was presented at the 2020 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. In that regard, Uganda adopted its third five- year national development plan for 2020/21 to 2024/25 under the theme of \u201cSustainable industrialization for inclusive growth, employment and wealth creation\u201d. The plan emphasizes key interventions in broad transformative categories for implementation, including environmental protection, governance and industrialization, working closely with development partners and other relevant stakeholders, particularly in the context of building back better in the work of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. It prioritizes the elimination of the silo approach to service delivery and enhances synergies across sectors and among other actors in the implementation of national sustainable development priorities and policies.\n\u201cClimate change remains one of the greatest challenges of our time. We continue to witness climate-change disasters across the globe that result in considerable loss of life and property. It is clear that no country is immune to such disasters. Addressing climate change calls for effective and bold multilateral action from all of us. Uganda, for example, has continued to experience prolonged droughts, melting ice caps on its highest mountain, Mount Rwenzori, floods, erratic rainfall and landslides. We recently experienced the impact of intensive and prolonged rainfall that increased the levels of major bodies of water and caused flooding in several areas of the country. The Government will continue to invest in climate adaptation and mitigation measures that include expanding access to and consumption of clean energy in order to enhance production, as well as increasing forest and wetland cover, in line with our ambitious nationally determined contributions. Those investments will enable us to halt, reduce and reverse environmental degradation and the adverse effects of climate change, as well as to improve the sustainable use of natural resources for inclusive economic growth.\n\u201cMobilizing the means of implementation for mitigating and adapting to the effects of climate change, including resilience, remains critical, particularly at the international level. In that regard, Uganda will support bold action proposals at the twenty-sixth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, scheduled for 2021, in the areas of mitigation, adaptation and financing. We therefore urge developed countries to fulfil their financial commitments in line with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change to provide $100 billion annually by 2020 to assist developing States parties in both mitigation and adaptation. We also continue to witness an increasing trend in biodiversity loss, with wildlife and other living species endangered and at risk of extinction. We all rely heavily on the planet for our livelihoods. In that regard, we should therefore reaffirm our determination to protect the planet from degradation, including through sustainable production and consumption and the sustainable management of natural resources so that it can support the needs of present and future generations.\n\u201cAs the United Nations commemorates its seventy-fifth anniversary, Uganda joins the community of nations in acknowledging the legitimacy, convening power, normative impact and undeniable successes that our shared vision can achieve. Much, however, remains to be done in order to further strengthen international cooperation in achieving the three interrelated and interdependent goals of global and regional peace and security, sustainable economic development for all and the advancement of human rights and dignity.\n\u201cThis seventy-fifth anniversary year also marks the end of the third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, at a time when 17 non-self-governing territories remain on the books with regard to the implementation of the declaration on the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples. The unresolved question of Western Sahara remains the single issue standing in the way of the total eradication of colonialism on the African continent. Uganda therefore joins the international community in underscoring its commitment to the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, including those of equal rights and the self- determination of peoples.\n\u201cThe General Assembly approved the quadrennial comprehensive policy review of the operational activities for the development of the United Nations system and the repositioning of the United Nations development system in 2016 and 2018 respectively, in order to make the development system more strategic, accountable, transparent, collaborative, efficient, effective and results-oriented. That approval arose out of the need to reposition United Nations operational activities for development so that they support countries in their national efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We commend the Secretary-General for the progress made so far in implementing the approved reforms in consultation with Member States. Uganda will work within the Group of 77 (G-77) and China during the next cycle of the quadrennial comprehensive policy review to ensure that it receives appropriate policy guidance over the next four years to support countries in accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in their jurisdictions.\n\u201cSouth-South cooperation has continued to prove to be an important element of international cooperation in addressing global challenges in the global South, particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Countries in the global South have received support from their global counterparts, which has enhanced their national as well as regional capacities in responding to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. Cognizant of the critical role of South-South cooperation in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Uganda will continue to support the strengthening of South-South cooperation among the members of the G-77 and China and within the United Nations, in line with its principles. As host of the third South-South Summit, I look forward to welcoming the leaders of the G-77 and China to the Summit, to be held in Kampala on suitable dates in 2021.\n\u201cUganda applauds the Secretary-General for his timely appeal for a global ceasefire during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no doubt that the pandemic has had a global impact on all aspects of our lives, social, economic and political, and in almost all countries across the globe. Where armed conflicts and wars have continued, the pandemic has made worsening situations even more dire. Africa\u2019s continental and subregional organizations have continued to play a critical role in conflict prevention and crisis the continent. I welcome the direct partnership and engagement between the United Nations and the African Union on peace and security matters, which have accelerated in recent years. Our experience has shown that wherever the international community, and the United Nations in particular, has supported regional efforts, they have been successful. We should encourage and strengthen that partnership.\n\u201cUganda continues to support and advance peace and security efforts in the region. We are fully aware that the prosperity and development of countries in our region and beyond are inextricably linked to peace and security. We remain actively involved in regional initiatives such as those of IGAD, the EAC, the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region and the AU, and are encouraged by the progress we see. We will continue to support the peace efforts under those frameworks, such as those in South Sudan, the political transition in the Sudan and the stabilization efforts in Somalia.\n\u201cThe threat of terrorism remains a security challenge of our time. We should be mindful that while COVID-19 and a number of measures taken by Governments around the globe may have helped to suppress the activities of violent extremist and terrorist groups, the new normal created by the crisis can also play into the hands of violent extremists and terrorist groups. Uganda remains committed to supporting global and regional counter-terrorism efforts. In our own region, terrorist groups such as Al-Shabaab, Boko Haram, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham, Al-Qaida and the Allied Democratic Forces continue to be a threat to our common security and development. Neutralizing them requires cooperative and firm responses.\n\u201cAfter 75 years of the existence of the United Nations, the need to reform the Security Council is more urgent and imperative than ever. The current geopolitical realities such as the global health pandemic are compelling reasons for comprehensive reform of the Security Council. Reform will further enhance the Council\u2019s authority and efficiency. Seventy-five years on, it is time to take bold steps to address the long-standing injustice and imbalance in the present configuration of the Security Council. We should make way for the equitable representation of unrepresented and underrepresented regions, especially Africa. African issues dominate the Council\u2019s agenda, and yet Africa remains the only region without representation in the permanent category of Security Council members and is also underrepresented in the non-permanent category. We should demonstrate the political will to redress the historical injustice done to the African continent. We therefore urge all Member States to work to achieve progress on comprehensive reform of the Security Council.\n\u201cFinally, later this year an important election will be held forjudges of the International Court of Justice, one of our Organization\u2019s key organs. Uganda accepted the Court\u2019s compulsory jurisdiction, without any reservations, as long ago as March 1963, when we were a new member of the United Nations family. We are proud that Judge Julia Sebutinde of Uganda, the first African woman on the Court and one who has served it with distinction, will be up for re-election for a second and final term. I commend Judge Julia Sebutinde to the General Assembly and request its support for her re-election to a second and final mandate on the International Court of Justice.\u201d"

        "file_text": "Mr. President of the General Assembly,\nExcellencies,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nThe General Debate for this 75th session is held in a context marked by the global health, economic and social crisis.\nOn this occasion, I would like to send a greeting of friendship and solidarity from the people of Cabo Verde to all the peoples of the United Nations, deploring the loss of human life that resulted from the coronavirus pandemic and encouraging a resilience that will lead us to better days.\nFor the past 75 years, our tradition is to annually hold the debate of UN General Assembly in New York. This is the meeting of the world and the great gathering of its peoples.\nThe general debate of this 75th session attempts to use a digital platform for the same purpose. We do it without the usual warmth of the hugs and handshakes in the corridors, halls and receptions without the face-to-face interaction of live diplomacy, which is the most effective one.\nI would like to pay special regards to the outgoing President of the General Assembly, Professor Tijjani Muhammad-Bande of Nigeria. I congratulate him for having successfully accomplished a mandate and demonstrated leadership and adaptability in the difficult context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nI would like to welcome the new President of the General Assembly, Mr. Volkan Bozkir of Turkey, and wish him every success in his presidency.\nI would like to congratulate the Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, on his tireless stewardship a leadership that has given face and voice to the most anguish of peoples in these moments of great uncertainty while at the same time striving to build global solidarity that responds effectively to the impacts of COVID 19 on the lives of people, countries and the world.\nMr. President,\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is a global threat. Humanity is confronting its greatest challenge in more than a century.\nThe impact of the pandemic has profoundly human and humanitarian dimensions. It affects people, their lives, their health, their families, their livelihood, their employment, their social inclusion and protection, their mobility, their leisure and their psychological and mental stability.\nThe pandemic has further exacerbated inequalities between developed and developing countries.\nFew countries in the world have enough savings to accommodate the extraordinary costs imposed by the global crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and, at the same time, to recover and relaunch their respective economies.\nIn developed countries, such as those of the European Union, a financial package of \u20ac750 billion was needed to support member states. The financial stimuli of the richest countries exceed hundreds of billion dollars. And what about Africa? And small island developing states Are they able to bear the costs and the recovery and relaunch based on their savings alone? Of course not!\nWe are facing internal struggles in each country and at the same time a global struggle, which requires global collaborative solutions.\nNobody wins with Africa more impoverished, with an increase of humanitarian and security crises. Everyone wins if African countries have the necessary resources to overcome the serious health, economic and social crisis caused by COVID-19, and enter a new era of structural transformations that positively impact their economies and their Human Development Indexes.\nIt is in this context access to a vaccine should be equitable and universal and external debt should be forgiven. These must be the subject of a Global Responsibility Pact in order not to leave anyone behind.\nExternal debt forgiveness is essential. It is necessary not only to deal with the economic contraction and macroeconomic imbalances caused by the coronavirus crisis, but as a turning point to boost the sustainable development of African countries in the framework of strong commitments to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nA differentiated approach must be given towards to Small Island Developing States (SIDS), taking into account their great vulnerabilities to external economic and environmental shocks as well as their great dependence on tourism, a sector devastated by the global pandemic.\nMany of the SIDS have historically performed well in reforms and policies aimed at increasing resilience and reducing vulnerabilities, but these need time to be effective. Past efforts cannot be in vain. That is why it makes perfect sense to focus on debt cancellation or relief initiatives leading to not just the recovery of economies but the pursuit of sustainable development.\nFor SIDS, the response of the international community cannot and should not be an eligibility problem based on per capita GDP. Instead, global efforts should focus on the evidence that reforms are helping nations to make progress in achieving the SDGs.\nIn Cabo Verde, our priority has been to apply the resources released from external debt service to finance the Strategic Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030. In doing so, we emphasize: (1) human capital development; (2) health security and public health; (3) digital transformation; (4) energy transition; (5) water strategy for agriculture associated with renewable energies; (6) blue economy; and (7) sustainable tourism.\nThey are drivers of the SDGs to make Cabo Verde a country that is more resilient and less vulnerable to external shocks... eliminating extreme poverty... improve household income... and creating decent job opportunities for young people within a more diverse economy.\nThese priorities are achievable with the shortening of public investment cycles, the attraction of national and foreign private investments, public-private partnerships, and cooperation for development. All of this is possible within an environment of political and social stability, low reputational risks, and a business friendly mindset. In short, building an institutional framework of trust.\nMr. President,\nToday, once again, with the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of Multilateralism is clear. Everyone loses when economies are disrupted and when borders are closed. Some may lose more than others, but our world and its peoples are far worse off.\nThe devastating potential of climate change knows no borders, either. And everyone loses, especially the generations of the 21st century and generations to come.\nPoverty, hunger, insecurity, instability and violent extremism, such as terrorism and organized crime, have impacts and implications that extend well beyond a nation\u2019s borders.\nWe live today in the context of a serious pandemic. But it must not confine the ambition of Agenda 2030.\nThe Decade of Action initiative launched by the Secretary General could not be more timely. We must speed up and make the implementation of Agenda 2030 more urgent so we can better respond, recover, and rebuild. Cabo Verde firmly supports this initiative.\nThe pathway to the future we want is full of uncertainty, but the continuing mandate of the United Nations will serve as a beacon to light the way.\nWe have an opportunity to build a better and more sustainable world in the post-pandemic era, one that is... defined by the advent of peace and the reduction of conflict... more secure... no longer proliferating nuclear weapons... more focused on human rights... driven by sustainable and human development... and energized by greater cooperation in matters of security, economics, knowledge, science and technology, with benefits for all.\nPolitical leaders have an increased responsibility and none, from any country, should be absent from the commitment to millions of young people who legitimately care about their future and that of their children and grandchildren to come.\nThe United Nations we need must unite nations in building the future we want. This can only be achieved by reaffirming the undeniable importance of Multilateralism.\nSeventy-five years later, everyone agrees that it is necessary to reform the Organization, namely: the composition and functioning of the Security Council... the revitalization of the General Assembly... the strengthening of the Economic and Social Council... and the alignment of working methods and cooperation among these main bodies.\nThere is an urgency to carry out these reforms, both in relation to peacebuilding and in relation to the promotion of development. And that depends on us, the United Nations, the leaders of the peoples of the United Nations.\nThank you very much."

        "file_text": "Mr President,\nAllow me at the outset to extend my thanks to Tijjani Muhammad-Bande for his distinguished efforts as President of the General assembly during its previous session. I would like to wish you, Mr. President, success in conducting the work of the current session objectively and wisely.\nThe convening of the high-level segment of the current session garners particular importance this year as it coincides with the commemoration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations. It also comes at a time when the world is facing the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the most profound crises of our times in terms of both its severity and impact. It has caused tragic human losses as well as had a profound economic and social impact that will affect the world for many years to come. These events come at a time when a number of other crises and conflicts continue to put an immense strain on states and deplete the resources of current and future generations. The critical juncture, which we now face forces upon us, more than any other time, to undertake an in-depth discussion on the situation of the current world order and how to improve the working methods of the multilateral system. This includes the need to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of how to implement the fundamentals and principles upon which the organization was founded. We should spare no effort to seize this critical moment, emanating from our sense of responsibility before history and in the eyes of the future generations.\nMore than 75 years have passed since the founding of the United Nations and the adoption of its Charter, which laid solid foundations to support and strengthen international cooperation in the three main areas of work of the organization. The Charter was not solely a legally binding international document but also the product of painful human experiences due to the ravages and horrors of war, from which the international community was able to derive a number of purposes, principles and fundamental rules that were enshrined in the Charter. These later evolved into preemptory norms that form the constitution that governs joint international interaction. Despite this the situation of the world today by no means comes close to what we had aspired to achieve. In spite of the large progress made with regards to laying the frameworks and norms governing the relations between states and confronting international crises, a number of obstacles stand in the way of their implementation.\nMr. President,\nEgypt, by virtue of its geographic location, its African, Arab, Islamic, and Mediterranean affiliations, the pride it takes that its land extends into Asia and as a founding member of the United Nations, has a clear vision on the approach that should be adopted to improve the performance and enhance the effectiveness of the multilateral system in general and the United Nations in particular. I would like to seize this opportunity to present some of the concrete measures that need to be pursued in order to realize our objectives in the three pillars of work of the organization.\nFirstly, with regards to the maintenance of international peace and security, it has become imperative to adopt an approach that guarantees the implementation of resolutions that are adopted within the multilateral system. Priority should be accorded to the implementation of the well established rules and principles of international law and which are enshrined in the Charter. This requires political will on behalf of member-states to respect and implement such resolutions and to enhance the United Nations on two main fronts. First there is a need to diligently monitor the implementation of what has been agreed upon and to take all necessary measures to assist states in implementing their obligations and building their capacities, taking into consideration the principle of national ownership. Second, there is a need to hold states that deliberately breach international law and United National resolutions accountable, and especially resolutions of the Security Council.\nIn this context, it is no longer acceptable for Security Council resolutions which deal with counter terrorism, and which provide a legal framework for combatting this deadly scourge, to remain without effective implementation and full commitment by some member-states which believe that they will not be held accountable for political reasons. It is regrettable that the international community continues to turn a blind eye towards a number of states to terrorists which extend material and financial support to terrorists, or provide safe heavens or political and media platforms as well as facilitating the transfer of terrorist fighters to areas of conflict, especially Libya and before it Syria. These deliberate violations indicate nothing other than a complete disregard for the Security Council, and the continuation of which will result in discrediting the Council\u2019s resolutions and diminishing the councils stature and credibility.\nEgypt\u2019s interest in upholding international peace and security includes protecting people from, the scourge of armed conflict through launching comprehensive political processes based on relevant security council resolutions. In Libya, for example, Egypt continues to adhere to the political resolution process, led by the UN, based on the Skhirat Agreement, the outcomes of the Berlin Conference, and the Cairo Declaration subscribed to by both the Speaker of the Libyan House of Representatives and the Commander-in-chief of the Libyan National Army. To this effect, the Cairo Declaration serves as a joint comprehensive political initiative to end the conflict in Libya, including a set of precise steps and a clear schedule aiming at restoring the political system and instituting a consensual Libyan government that lives up the aspirations of the Libyan people. The ramifications of the ongoing crisis are not only confined to Libya, but also spill over to affect security in neighboring countries, as well as its negative effects on international stability. In that light, Egypt is bent on supporting Libyans to rid their Country of armed militias and terrorist organizations, and put an end to the blatant interference of some regional Parties that deliberately transported foreign fighters into Libya, in an effort to fulfill their well- known greed and long-standing colonial illusions. Hence, as we declared before, and reiterate today, any breach to the line extending between the towns of Sirte and Jufra, previously demarcated as a red line, will be fiercely faced by Egypt in defense of its People and its national security, and we also renew our call to all Parties to return to the political process aiming at restoring peace, security and stability deserved by the People of Libya.\nIf we are to rightly implement international resolutions aiming at achieving long-lasting peace and security in the Middle East, no issue would be more worthy of our attention than the issue of Palestine, whose People still strive to their most basic human right and that is living in a free and independent State along with its neighbors in the region. Generations of Palestinians have strived to achieve this right, and a multitude of resolutions elapsed ever since, to no avail, putting a heavy strain on human conscience. The fulfillment of the legitimate aspirations of Palestinians in an independent state, with East Jerusalem as its capital, is imperative, if we are to open new horizons for peace, cooperation and coexistence, and for peace and security to prevail in the region. The international community has an obligation to honor its commitment to achieve the long-awaited peace, and to address any measures that eat up Palestinian lands and undermine the two-state solution as stipulated in international resolutions, and on which the peace process that Egypt has engaged on to achieve a just, comprehensive and durable peace is based.\nIn Syria, a comprehensive political solution has become a necessity in order to put off the raging war and implement all the components of the political settlement outlined in Security Council resolution 2254 (2015) in its entirety, in a manner that preserves the unity of Syria, its territorial integrity, the integrity of its institutions, fulfills the aspirations of its people, and terminates all forms of terrorism. In the same vein, it\u2019s about time for a firm stand in Yemen to put an end to the ongoing crisis there, in accordance with UNSC resolution 2216 (2015), the Gulf Countries initiative and the outcomes of the comprehensive national dialogue, and in a manner that upholds legitimacy, guarantees Yemen\u2019s unity and independence, and puts an end to using Yemen as a launching pad targeting its neighbors and obstructing the free navigation in the Strait of Bab al-Mandab.\nMr. President,\nWith regards to the Renaissance Dam matter, I wish to seize this opportunity to convey to you the mounting concerns of the Egyptian nation regarding this project, currently being constructed by a neighboring and friendly Country, which shares a river that has provided life to millions of people for thousands of years.\nWe have spent the better part of a decade in tiresome negotiations with our brothers in the Sudan and Ethiopia, through which our aim was to reach an agreement on the filling and operation of the dam. An agreement that strikes the requisite balance between the development needs of the friendly Ethiopian people, and the preservation of Egypt\u2019s water interests and its right to life. Throughout this year, we have undertaken successive rounds of intense negotiations, in which the United States Government exerted much appreciated efforts to bring the positions of the three Countries closer, through the talks it sponsored for several months with the World Bank. Moreover, Egypt engaged in good faith in the deliberations initiated by my brother the Prime Minister of the Sudan, and afterwards in the negotiations called for by the Republic of South Africa in its current capacity as Chairperson of the African Union. Unfortunately, none of these efforts resulted in any tangible outcome.\nIndeed, the Nile River must not be monopolized by one state. For Egypt, the Nile water is an existential matter. This however does not mean that we want to undermine the rights of our brothers and sisters sharing with us the Nile Basin. In this vein, the convening of a Security Council consultative meeting, on 29 June this year, highlighted the importance of this issue and, its potential risks and its direct bearing on international peace and security. The convening of such a meeting places on the international community the responsibility to urge all parties to reach the desired agreement, which meets our mutual interests. Nevertheless, it is unacceptable for the negotiations to continue forever in an attempt to impose realities on the ground, because our people yearn for stability and development towards a new promising era of cooperation.\nMr. President,\nRegarding the second pillar of the United Nations, which is achieving sustainable development, Egypt firmly believes that fostering the developmental efforts is a fundamental precondition to enhance international peace & security and to establish a stable world order.\nThis is the paramount path to prevent extremism, as well as to prevent armed conflicts and humanitarian crises. Egypt has supported the adoption of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and performed a vital role to support the efforts of the Secretary General to reform the United Nations developmental system, as we believe in the importance of bolstering the Organization\u2019s efforts in order to accomplish these optimistic objectives. While bearing in mind that these efforts are considered as an important initial step on the right path, these efforts have to be followed by additional steps that help the countries to lessen the socioeconomic gap between the developed and developing states, and to cure the problem of financing for development. Furthermore, the current profound crisis due to COVID-19 pandemic mandates the world to provide support for the developing countries through offering stimulating packages for their economies, reducing their accumulated debt liabilities, and utilizing the available instruments of the international financial institutions aiming at contributing to create favorable environment for them. This would help these developing countries to contain the impacts of the pandemic and to deal with their already-existing problems, such as terrorism, disorderly migration and treating the root-causes of conflicts.\nIn this context, we have to highlight the necessity of supporting Africa in specific, and to develop real and potent partnerships to support the Continent\u2019s capacities in order to face the political and economic problems, to obtain the required knowledge and technology, as well as to improve the African human resources and to provide the needed funding with the smoothest conditionality. The African continent, with its unique features, is able to become a new locomotive for the international economy, particularly with the historic steps taken by the African Union to launch the Continental Free Trade Zone, as well as enhancing the arrangements of regional integration, and formulating ambitious strategy for infrastructure, energy and transportation, in addition to other relevant initiatives.\nMr. President,[sIpjRegarding the third pillar of the United Nations, the international agenda of human rights garners increased importance for its direct impact on strengthening the human buildup, improving the level of services provided to people, and preserving one\u2019s rights. This guarantees decent life and the ability to deal with the challenges on all political, economic, social and cultural levels, which at the same time enhances the stability of the international system.\nIn light of the Egyptian Constitution and its amendments related to the basic rights and liberties as well as the rights of future generations, we have embarked on strengthening our endeavor in human rights field towards all political, economic and social perspectives, with a belief in the necessity of their integration. Egypt has also reestablished its Senate with its role in supporting the democratic system and Egypt is currently guaranteeing the suitable representation for women in the parliamentary chambers, as at least one quarter of the Egyptian House of Representatives is allocated for women. We also seek organizing the work of the state institutions & national organs, separation of power, settling the concept of power transfer and limiting the Presidential terms to two. While we are currently finalizing the Senate elections, the first legislative term of the Egyptian House of Representatives is approaching its termination in light of the new constitution, during which the Parliament has accomplished several sets of legislations, which supplement the constitution in order to strengthen the basic rights and liberties, as well as all other important laws in the social and economic fields. Furthermore, the vitality of the previous parliamentary discussions is indicative to the hopes and aspirations of our citizens in continuing and enhancing the peaceful democratic practice, which is in the benefit of the Egyptian people who is the main stakeholder and the source of all authorities.\nBased on the provisions of the constitution and inspired by the values and rich heritage of Egypt, many strides have been taken to strengthen citizenship and achieve justice, equality and equal opportunities, without discrimination on any grounds. Such words have turned into goals towards which we have made significant progress in a short time, be it in the fields of empowering Egyptian women and combating all forms of violence against them, calling for the reform of religious discourse, promoting citizenship as a principle that does not differentiate between Muslim and Christian compatriots, affirming freedom of belief or the state\u2019s undertaking of building worship places without discrimination. In addition to efforts to enable people with special needs, investing in youth especially by including them in the decisionmaking process, establishing direct dialogues with them through periodic youth forums, and implementing training and qualification initiatives for young people to participate effectively in public work.\nAt the economic level, it would not have been possible to overcome the difficult and painstaking stages of the structural reform programme without the legitimacy granted by the Egyptian people to state institutions by their direct and free will. The success of these reforms had a major contribution to fortifying the economy and limiting its losses due to the Corona virus pandemic, taking into consideration that Egypt is among the few countries that were able to achieve positive growth rates despite the pandemic, in addition to controlling inflation rates and the decline of unemployment to its lowest levels in twenty years.\nIf mere data and statistics do not depict the magnitude of what is being achieved in Egypt, then the best witness and evidence are the tangible and continuous achievements and major national projects in infrastructure, provision of decent housing and energy, especially the production of new and renewable energy, which directly contribute to safeguarding the citizen\u2019s right in a decent living.\nStructural reform processes have always been precarious due to their negative repercussions on some groups of society. This called upon us to formulate social programmes targeting those on lower income to provide them with the necessary protection, and mitigate the effects of reforms on them in a framework of solidarity that preserves their dignity.\nConcurrently, we were keen on prioritizing health care as a fundamental right, as Egypt has already started implementing the universal health coverage programme for all its citizens. In parallel, we succeeded in launching the largest medical survey campaign in history to detect and eliminate hepatitis C and non-communicable diseases and dispense treatment dispensed free of charge for discovered cases. In addition, initiatives were launched to end the waiting lists for critical surgeries, support women\u2019s health, and treat various diseases that affect newborns and schoolchildren in particular.\nIn the midst of all of the above, and without propaganda or blackmail, I would like to point out that we have never failed in our humanitarian duty towards the nearly five million immigrants and refugees who were forced to leave their countries due to wars, political crises and difficult economic conditions. They are being hosted in Egypt among its people where they enjoy all services provided by the state to Egyptian citizens, without receiving any aid or significant support from our international partners, despite the importance they attach to the rights of those immigrants. Accordingly, we call for the adoption of a comprehensive approach to address the root causes of illegal immigration and asylum, by working to achieve sustainable development in the source and hosting countries and promoting the opening of legal migration channels, instead of security solutions and rhetoric of contempt, hate, discrimination and closing borders.\nAll of the aforementioned provides a clear indication of the importance Egypt attaches to protecting human rights, and its continued endeavor to upgrade its capabilities to fulfill the ambitions of its citizens and achieve their legitimate aspirations in line with the comprehensive perspective defined by Egypt\u2019s Vision 2030.\nMr. President\nThe United Nations was born from the suffering and plight that humanity went through and its Charter was inspired by accumulated and broad experiences, hoping to forge a better future for humanity. There is no doubt that we should not wait for decades and centuries to draw the lessons learned from the Organization\u2019s 75 years journey. Hence, it is imperative to address the issue of equitable geographical representation in the Security Council in order to better reflect of the realities today\u2019s world and the current balance of power, which is very different from what it was during the formulation of the international system. Egypt stresses the importance of expanding the Council in both its permanent and non-permanent categories, which will enhance its credibility and achieve a fair representation of Africa to correct the historical injustice inflicted on it, and address its legitimate demands enshrined in the Ezulwini Consensus and Sirte Declaration.\nIn order to confront the grave challenges resulting from the outbreak of Coronavirus pandemic, as well as the existing regional and international problems, it is imperative for us to uphold the principle of international cooperation and solidarity to more than ever before and avoid rivalry and polarization.\nIf hope is born out of pain, then perhaps we will find in the current crises what motivates us to breathe new life into our relentless efforts to enhance international multilateral action and the role of the United Nations as its driving force.\nEgypt, as a founding member of this organization, and in lieu of its contributions to human civilization since the dawn of history, will spare no effort to achieve the vision of renewal and reform. This is based on a firm conviction that \u201cthe world has room for us all,\u201d as long as the relations between countries and peoples are governed by abandonment of conflicts, peace-making and building, and international cooperation in order to achieve development and prosperity for both current and future generations."

        "file_text": "E nga mana, e nga reo, Rau Rangatira ma o te Ao, Nga mangai o nga whenua ake, Huri rauna I te Ao, Tend koutou katoa mai Aotearoa.\nMy opening remarks were in Te Reo Maori, an official language of New Zealand and the language of the indigenous people of Aotearoa New Zealand. While geographically remote, New Zealand is deeply connected to its region and to the rest of the world. That connectedness drives us to seek common purpose with the countries in the Assembly Hall \u2014 the common purpose of a more prosperous, sustainable and peaceful world for all.\nFor New Zealanders, diversity is strength. We strive for a more equal society and value strong institutions that promote fairness and deliver for all people. We are a country founded on the Treaty of Waitangi \u2014 Te Tiriti o Waitangi \u2014 which requires a genuine and sustained partnership and a search for shared solutions. We still have work to do at home, but these values guide our approach to global cooperation. Our connectedness also means that New Zealand relies on global cooperation and on multilateralism. At the heart of that is the United Nations. We invest in this system not only because is it the right thing to do, but because it helps build a safer, more prosperous and more sustainable future. Our security and prosperity are the peace and prosperity of every other country.\nOur interdependence with other nations has never been more evident as our countries have tackled the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. New Zealanders believe in inclusiveness, equality and a sense of community, beliefs that shape our approach to tackling the pandemic. Our response has been science-based and precautionary. We responded rapidly to each outbreak and New Zealanders have played their part in preventing widespread community transmission. The management of the New Zealand border continues to be our key line of defence.\nWhile we are all learning to live with the impact of COVID-19 domestically, we must also focus on its impact globally. To defeat the virus globally, we will need to be at our collective best. We have to pool our best ideas, think innovatively and share our best people and resources. We need to invest in and trust each other. We support the World Health Organization and the role it played in coordinating an early response. The international system has responded well in addressing the early health, humanitarian and development effects of COVID-19, but the need for international cooperation goes beyond that. We must work together to develop and distribute a vaccine on an equitable basis. To achieve that, New Zealand has joined the COVAX Facility. This will ensure that COVID-19 vaccines can be equitably distributed to every country participating worldwide. By supporting COVAX, we also demonstrate our commitment to ensuring that vulnerable communities everywhere, including in the Pacific, receive the vaccines they need. No one is safe until we are all safe. We encourage other countries to support vaccine multilateralism and ensure the unimpeded, fair and equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines worldwide.\nCOVID-19 and its secondary impacts are having a disproportionate effect on the world\u2019s most vulnerable groups. Millions of children are out of education with no ability to learn from home, and millions have missed life-saving vaccinations. Ethnic minorities are dying from COVID-19 at a disproportionately high rate. Many working in the informal economy, particularly women, lack access to social safety nets. And there has been a concerning increase in gender-based violence. While a vaccine would return some normality to our lives, it may take years to recover from the socioeconomic effects of the pandemic. But we have an opportunity to mitigate them. We must work together for a global economic recovery that protects the most vulnerable, creates jobs and maintains supply chains and open markets. We must ensure that the recovery respects and promotes the human rights of all. We must recommit to the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. And we should rally behind the Secretary-General\u2019s call for a global ceasefire so we can all focus on prevention and recovery.\nWhere we live, in the Pacific, the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic have been and will continue to be particularly damaging. The outlook is challenging. Many small island developing States depend on tourism sectors that have been drastically affected by closed borders. Those countries also face significant constraints to ensuring economic resilience, and the pandemic has amplified those challenges. The international community must ensure that appropriate concessional financing is available to small island developing States to support their response to this economic shock. New Zealand is committed to working with the international community and supporting Pacific island countries to withstand the most damaging effects of the pandemic.\nBut in all crises there are opportunities. Our opportunity today is to build back better \u2014 to rethink how our economies can work for the many, not just the few, to better focus on the most vulnerable and to rebuild our societies to prioritize tackling the defining challenge of our generation \u2014 climate change. Many of the things I have said about COVID-19 apply equally to climate change, but there will be no vaccine against the latter.\nThe threat of climate change is more real in the Pacific than in any other region in the world. Some of the most climate-affected nations in the world sit within our region. Sea-level rise poses an extreme threat to many Pacific islands. They are paying the price for our collective inaction and their fate is in our hands. They rely on the United Nations and its Member States to make political decisions and commitments to protect their future. The full implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is critical. Moreover, it is time for a global reset aimed at a greener economy. We must stop fossil-fuel subsidies and divert those billions of dollars into transitioning to clean-energy generation. It is time to rethink how our societies can simultaneously focus on the well-being of our people and of our environment.\nThe critical importance that biodiversity plays in ensuring the welfare of our people, the economy and the environment will be highlighted tomorrow in the high- level summit on biodiversity. Biodiversity all over the world is in serious decline. The time for action is now and New Zealand is stepping up. We have launched Te Mana o te Taiao, the Aotearoa New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy, to guide the way we protect and restore nature. We urge all others to join us in increasing our ambition on biodiversity protection. It is one of the best investments we have in our future. \nNew Zealand will continue to advocate for advancing gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. We were the first country in the world in which women won the right to vote. Our top three constitutional positions are all held by women and we currently have our third woman Prime Minister. We are proud of our gains, but mindful of the continuing gap. On Thursday, we will celebrate the twenty- fifth anniversary of the fourth World Conference on Women. The Beijing Platform for Action remains as relevant today as it was 25 years ago, and we recommit to completing the unfinished work. To achieve the commitments set out in Beijing, we must protect the rights of all women and girls. Collectively, we need to do more to eliminate gender inequalities. Realizing gender equality is everyone\u2019s responsibility. It is simply non-negotiable and we will not rest until it is achieved.\nAt recent events marking the seventy-fifth anniversary of the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, we recalled the catastrophic consequences of nuclear weapons. The testing of such weapons has also had a disastrous impact in the Pacific region. We know that no State or organization can prepare for the unimaginable suffering in the wake of a nuclear holocaust, and if we cannot prepare, we must prevent. That is why New Zealand signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. We urge all others to join that landmark treaty and we welcome its imminent entry into force. The Treaty\u2019s global prohibition on nuclear weapons is a necessary step on the way towards their total elimination. As we will also emphasize in New Zealand\u2019s statement to be delivered later this week on the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, it is time for global negotiations involving all nuclear-weapon possessors to take place in order to enable us to achieve nuclear zero.\nIn conclusion, it was out of the devastation of the Second World War that nations pledged to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. Now, in 2020 more than ever, the international community must step up collectively and in the common interest. Since 1945, New Zealand has championed the United Nations and the wider international system. Today we recommit to playing our part in ensuring that the multilateral system collectively responds to our shared and urgent challenges. New Zealand urges all other Member States to do the same. Nau te rourou, naku te rourou ka ora ai te iwi. That translates as \u201cWith your food basket and my food basket, the people will thrive.\u201d Stay safe, everyone."

        "file_text": "His Excellency, Mr. Volkan Bozkir, President of the United Nations General Assembly;\nHis Excellency, Mr. Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations; Excellencies and distinguished delegates;\nOn behalf of the Government and people of Papua New Guinea, I am pleased to address, for the first time, this august body in an unprecedented manner via a prerecorded virtual video.\nThis has emanated, courtesy of the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting worldwide and devastatingly on all aspects of our livelihoods. Our sympathies, condolences and prayers are with the many victims of this virus and we stand in solidarity with all nations and peoples affected by it.\nMr. President,\nI congratulate you and the Government of Turkey on your election to lead the important work of the General Assembly over the next year.\nI pledge Papua New Guinea\u2019s support during your tenure under the well-chosen theme of a strengthened multilateralism that reinforces the collective good of \u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations\u201d, as called for by the Charter of the United Nations.\nI also want to thank the outgoing President of the General Assembly, His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande for his outstanding leadership, including over the past seven months, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic challenges.\nSimilarly, we thank Secretary-General Guterres for his decisive and robust leadership of our collective work.\nMr. President,\nThis year, as we reflect on the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations, the importance and necessity of the United Nations, particularly for small nations like mine, cannot be overstated.\nThough much more work, including strengthened reforms of the UN, is needed for a better and fairer world for all, it has also made much progress on global peace and security, human rights and social issues.\nWe have seen this firsthand in my own country in support of our development priorities, including through the transformative partnership for sustainable development, to combat COVID-19, measles, polio and TB, foster peace and security in Bougainville and in our Highlands region, supporting our women and girls equality, empowerment and protection from gender-based violence and environmental protection and combating climate change.\nThe onus is on all of us as succeeding generations to work collectively through multilateralism under the UN to stop the scourge of war, to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, to reestablish the basic conditions for justice and the rule of law, and to promote social progress and better standards of life in the future we want.\nMy Government also recognizes the important role of the UN system in support of the UN Member States development priorities.\nIn this context, I want to place on record my Government\u2019s appreciation to the UN Deputy Secretary-General, Ms. Amina Mohammed for being the first-ever female and highest ranking officer to visit Papua New Guinea in the past 45 years of the partnership between Papua New Guinea and the UN.\nThis was indeed a landmark UN visit and most welcomed by my Government to further consolidate the strong, cordial, expanding and constructive bonds that exist between Papua New Guinea and the UN.\nMr. President,\nCOVID-19 continues to test our resolve as countries and peoples, like never before with its multifaceted impacts.\nTo protect our country and people, my Government took leadership and ownership to set in place the necessary early preventive measures in policy and law, including passage of the National Pandemic Act 2020 to deal with it and such similar outbreaks in future. This has cushioned, to some extent, the toss of lives to just six, so far, in the country.\nWe are also working closely at the Pacific regional level through the Pacific Islands Forum to tackle COVID-19 and this has been relatively successful with minimal loss of lives.\nThe net effect of COVID-19 has resulted in job losses, export and other revenue decline, and development priorities put on hold, as I outline last July in our first ever Voluntary National Review Report on the implementation of our 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development to the High-Level Political Forum.\nUnless and until an effective vaccine is developed an available for use the health threats of COVID-19 cannot be underestimated. It is important that any COVID-19 vaccine developed should be for public health good and accessible and affordable to everyone.\nMr. President,\nMy Government is firmly committed and determined not to let COVID-19 overwhelm us. It is in this spirit that my Government\u2019s \u201cTake Back Papua New Guinea\u201d vision is framed to build back better, be resilient, be greener and take us forward as we strive towards achieving our long-term development Vision 2050.\nTo build back better from COVID-19, my Government has adopted a fivepronged strategic approach. First, the response will be PNG-owned, led and driven, which includes a vision for the future \u2014 using this crisis as a way to reshape our society into one that is fairer, united and more inclusive.\nSecondly, the response will be broad, comprehensive and inclusive, covering households in both rural and urban areas and also businesses \u2014 both small and big, formal and informal.\nThirdly, it will be smart and forward looking, where focus is on practical projects that build our economic capacity with Public Investment Program focused on projects ready to go and procurement arrangements streamlined to allow early commencement of activities.\nFourth, we want the response to be responsible. This means managing our debts in a way that it does not further burden the country in the medium to long-term.\nFifthly, leveraging appropriate development partnerships. In this regard, we also welcome with interest the Financing for Development initiative spearheaded by Canada, Jamaica and the UN Secretary-General.\nMr. President,\nWe have re-opened the economy for business to resume operations and invested in an economic stimulus package valued at PKG 5.6 billion or $1.6 billion, by far the largest in our nation\u2019s history, to support our local small-to-medium-enterprises, including particularly small farmers in the rural areas and women entrepreneurs, aimed at also strengthening food security and livelihoods.\nThis was done with the support of our development partners\u2019 in-country such as national banks, superannuation funds and state-owned enterprises and also from the IMF, World Bank and the Asian Development Bank as well as our bilateral partners including Australia and Japan. We are grateful to our development partners for their continued support.\nMr. President,\nMost recently, my Government has passed legislative amendments to our resource laws to address imbalances in major resource development projects. These amendments were to the Oil and Gas Act 1 998, the proposed 2020 Organic Law on Hydrocarbon and the Mining Act 1992.\nBy doing that, we can now negotiate fair and equitable returns for all stakeholders including multinational companies from exploitation of our renewable and nonrenewable resources.\nDespite the reforms, I place on record that PNG is still an attractive investment destination, and I invite foreign direct investment in all sectors including in hydrocarbon, mining, energy, agriculture, fisheries, forestry and tourism\nMr. President,\nIn terms of good governance, I am pleased to inform that Papua New Guinea continues to meet its obligations as a member State party to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC).\nIt is also anticipated that the Organic Law on an Independent Commission Against Corruption will be passed in this term of Parliament. The draft Organic Law has been debated in Parliament and an Interim Office of ICAC is in operation and is being funded by Government.\nIn addition to that a separate Whistle Blowers Act has been unanimously passed by the current Parliament to protect and encourage reporting on corruption. Simultaneously reforms to the Judiciary for a separate tract on corruption related offences for speedy proceedings have also been undertaken.\nMr. President,\nMy Government through its recently launched Connect PNG Policy (2020- 2040) which is focused on building, rehabilitating and expanding key enabling high quality economic infrastructure such as roads, airports and sea ports.\nThese are critical enablers to create economic corridors to connect our provinces and provide our MSMEs and SMEs access to good markets and export opportunities.\nMr. President,\nMy Government is now rolling out an extensive Rural Electrification Program to light up 70 per cent of the country which has been without reliable and affordable electricity by 2025, when we celebrate our 50 years of Independence.\nMr President,\nMy country recognizes the importance of ICT and recently completed construction of a domestic fibre optic submarine cable nationwide and launching of the international Coral Sea Cable linking our country with Australia, Solomon Islands and the rest of the world.\nThis will enable PNG to access reliable and affordable high-speed internet aimed at improving connectivity to all sectors, build e-commerce channels and enhance Government online services.\nMr. President,\nAlso as a maritime nation, my Government is placing high priority on investment and protection of our fisheries and maritime sector. This sector contributes a quarter of our annual budget and also employs 80 per cent women workforce in our tuna canneries.\nIn further support of this sector, we launched in July 2020 our first-ever National Oceans Policy 2020-2030, which will ensure that our oceans and seas and their resources are properly coordinated, managed, protected, governed and sustainably used. This will also contribute to further strengthening our national efforts to implement our SDG 14 commitments and obligations.\nIt will also supports the August 2019 decision of the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders under the Blue Pacific Continent narrative to ensure that our maritime zones delineated in accordance with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea could not be challenged or reduced as a result of sea-level rise and climate change.\nWe therefore look forward with keen interest to the outcome of the International Law Commission\u2019s Study Group on sea-level rise in relation to international law.\nWe are also interested to harnessing regional and global efforts including the Second UN Ocean Conference in 2021, the launch of the UN Decade of Ocean Science next year, and for the successful conclusion of the BBNJ treaty negotiations, to further protect our maritime zones, their natural resources and sustainable use.\nMr. President,\nAs we embark on the Decade of Action to deliver on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, I reaffirm my Government\u2019s commitment to this important universal agenda.\nOur Voluntary National Review Report to the High-Level Political Forum last July which I presented virtually clearly outlines and articulates the status of our national SDGs implementation, the gaps and challenges. The unexpected COVID-19 challenges will compound and undermined many of our development gains.\nNotwithstanding this, my Government is taking leadership and ownership of this under our Strategy for Responsible Sustainable Development (StaRS) and the Medium-Term Development Plan III, as welt as our Development Cooperation Framework.\nWe recognize that governments alone cannot achieve the SDGs. We therefore welcome development and multi-stakeholder partners to join us in delivering on the future we want.\nMr President,\nUnder SDG 13, PNG continues to comply with the Paris Agreement under the UNFCCC and presented our National Determined Contributions (NDC) report to the United Nations which was recently reviewed.\nOn deforestation and forest degradation, I call upon the UN to assist to find a balance between cutting our trees and forest for revenue against preserving them to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change given that PNG has 13% of the world\u2019s rainforest and 7 per cent of the world\u2019s biodiversity.\nThis continues to be an ongoing challenge for my Government in terms of meeting the peoples\u2019 basic needs to sustain their livelihoods against preservation of the forests in response to global warming.\nMy Government has recently approved PNG\u2019s National REDD+ Strategy and its Country Report which is a prerequisite to accessing the fund.\nMr. President,\nThe Bougainville peace process remains a priority for my Government and we are committed to the Peace Agreement, which has enabled nearly two decades of unbroken peace in Bougainville. I thank the UN for its continued support to the Peace Process on Bougainville.\nIn 2019, a Referendum was conducted on Bougainville.\nThe result of the Referendum is \u2018non-binding\u2019 wherein it does not determine a political future but rather, the responsibility rests with the National Parliament on a political future for Bougainville. As I speak, ABC elections are being conducted for a new Government by September 2020, and we are confident of a successful election.\nMy Government stands ready to welcome the newly elected members of the Bougainville House of Representatives and look forward to a cordial working relationship and a fruitful consultative process before a decision by National Parliament on the future of Bougainville\nMr. President,\nAs we also commemorate this year the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Beijing Fourth World Women\u2019s Conference, I would underscore that ensuring gender equality and empowerment cannot be taken for granted. In my country, we have a long way to go yet but this is work in progress and some level of success has been witnessed.\nThe scourge of gender-based violence is of serious concern to my Government and we are now not only reviewing policies and laws to address it effectively but also taking enforcement measures to prevent this unacceptable situation. There is an up swell of support at all levels, both in government, the private sector and civil society to stamp out gender-based violence in the country.\nAn important recent development was the launch of the Spotlight Initiative in March 2020, a joint initiative between my Government, the European Union and UN.\nThis is a long-term priority requiring sustainability and partnerships as the government cannot achieve alone. Another important development my Government is pursuing is to increase the level of women\u2019s representation in our Parliament, which at present does not have a women Parliamentarian.\nIt is incumbent on us to ensure that half of our country\u2019s population constituting women and girls have voice in the highest political level and it is the right thing to do.\nMr. President,\nFinally, we reiterate our call, once again, of the necessity and urgency for the holistic reforms of the United Nations. Particularly the Security Council, whose binding mandate on global peace and security with practices that are inconsistent with today\u2019s realities necessitates reforms that will make it more transparent and accountable to the wider UN membership.\nMr. President,\nIn closing, and speaking of UN reforms, Papua New Guinea welcomes the long overdue establishment of the UN multi-country office for the North Pacific region and looks forward to its opening and operations soon to support the sustainable development efforts of our Pacific sisters and brothers from the Micronesian subregion. Thank you."

        "file_text": "Your Excellency Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations,\nYour Excellency Volkan Bozkir, President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fifth session,\nLadies and gentlemen representatives of Member States,\nReceive the warmest greetings of the people of Nicaragua, from President and Commander Daniel Ortega Saavedra and Vice-President and First Lady Rosario Murillo, with a message of peace, health and prosperity for the Governments and peoples that constitute the United Nations.\nWe have come together at an exceptional time due to the pandemic affecting all of humankind. We reiterate our solidarity and condolences with the families around the world who are suffering the consequences of COVID-19. The pandemic has plunged the world into uncertainty and could further exacerbate major crises such as hunger, malnutrition, poverty, inequity, unemployment and climate change, which exist as a result of an economic system that is unjust and degrading to human beings.\nMr. President,\nAs we commemorate 75 years of our Organization, the world continues to cry out for peace, justice, security and a comprehensive response from the United Nations for the benefit of humankind. Reform of the United Nations, as proposed on behalf of Nicaragua by the priest and Nicaraguan Foreign Minister, Miguel d\u2019Escoto Brockmann, during his presidency of the General Assembly in 2008, is a matter of urgency.\nWe express both our hope for and our commitment to that necessary and dutiful transformation, with the reform and democratization of the United Nations and its organs, which will enable our Organization to serve in the interests of our peoples and not hegemonic Powers. We are confident that our peoples will move forward with vigour and hope to build a new world order, with justice, equality and multilateralism at its core, in order to guarantee international peace and security for the common good and the fulfilment of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\nWe are entering the last decade of action to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals. In order to achieve those objectives, we must join efforts in a true global alliance to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other pandemics imposed by some Powers to the detriment of international peace and security, the independence and sovereignty of States and the self-determination of peoples.\nNicaragua will continue to promote a culture of peace and peaceful coexistence among the brotherly countries that form the United Nations and we will continue to be a factor of regional peace and security and stability in Central America.\nWe also call for the continuation of global efforts in favour of safe, orderly and regular migration.\nAlthough the challenges posed by the pandemic are complex, we cannot forget the existential threat of climate change that continues to be overlooked as a consequence of unbridled capitalism. It is urgent that we ensure the survival of the human species and protect the life and rights of Mother Earth\nIn line with our peaceful vocation, Nicaragua also advocates for general and complete disarmament and is in favour of the total elimination of nuclear weapons.\nThe illegal unilateral coercive measures imposed by the United States against other populations must cease immediately to ensure stability, peace and development for families. We denounce and condemn the repeated attacks in a cruel and unrelenting war against the peoples of Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua in particular, which are designed to serve only foreign interests, as outlined in the interfering and interventionist policies of imperialists, and constitute a violation of human rights.\nWe denounce and condemn the aggression, through a brutal economic, political and commercial blockade, that is causing the worthy people of Cuba great suffering. We reaffirm our enduring solidarity with the legacy of Commander Fidel Castro, with General Raul Castro and with the President of sovereign Cuba, our brother Miguel Diaz-Canel.\nWe reaffirm our strong support for the sister Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which is suffering a brutal and criminal cowardly onslaught of aggressions by the United States imperialists. We reiterate our firm and unwavering defence of the sovereignty and the rights of the Bolivarian people, the people of Commander Hugo Chavez, led by our comrade Nicolas Maduro Moros, the legitimate President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela who is demonstrating heroic resistance with great civil-military unity in an unequal struggle.\nSuch coercive and aggressive imperialist policies constitute the real obstacle to the eradication of poverty and to progress towards sustainable development. Against the backdrop of a pandemic, these measures have become a crime against humanity by those who impose them.\nThe United Nations must focus on the well-being of human beings. Nicaragua rejects the politicization of the United Nations system, as promoted in particular by the Government of the United States, which seeks to convert its organs into instruments at the service of its interests in order to destabilize countries that do not submit to its imperialist dictates.\nThe Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights does not act fairly and equitably towards our country, by turning its oral updates and reports into intentionally politicized content. In addition to revealing worrying and serious methodological deficiencies, its reports are prepared exclusively from sources opposed to the Government of Nicaragua, compiling only information directly related to the failed coup attempt of 2018 from NGOs and the media.\nWe implore those bodies to remember that, 75 years ago, the countries of the world created the United Nations to ensure respect for human dignity, security and the peaceful coexistence and lives of peoples, and that they must conduct themselves in a manner consistent with international law and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations itself. We demand that all perspectives and all rights be taken into account by strengthening dialogue and peace in a world so in need of harmony and the peaceful resolution of any conflict.\nMr. President,\nNicaragua calls for the decolonization of the continent, with independence for Puerto Rico and the restitution of the sovereignty of the Malvinas Islands to the Republic of Argentina.\nNicaragua advocates for the two-State solution, with the State of Israel and the State of Palestine living side by side in peace and harmony, with East Jerusalem as the capital of the latter, in accordance with the pre-1967 borders, as enshrined in the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Security Council.\nWe reaffirm our unshakeable will to continue supporting the just struggle of the noble Saharawi people for self-determination. We respect their dignity and rights as a sovereign nation.\nOur Government of National Reconciliation and Unity expresses its unwavering support for the cause of the Syrian people in their fight to defend their dignity foreign aggression and international terrorism.\nWe hail the brotherly people of Iran and will continue to strengthen our bilateral relations in all fields of mutual interest and in defence of peace, sovereignty, and peaceful coexistence.\nWe condemn the hegemonic political aggressions of the United States, which undermine the peaceful resolution of conflicts, as well as the military, economic and commercial threats against Russian Federation, the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.\nWe must defend the principles of dialogue and negotiation and the non-use and threat of use of force, which are fundamental principles of our Organization.\nMr. President,\nLadies and gentlemen heads of delegation,\nToday, our commitment to strengthening the essential pillars of multilateralism cannot be postponed. We must safeguard and defend international law and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Nicaragua believes that only together, with solidarity, love and cooperation and without selfishness, can we triumph in the face of the great challenges facing humankind.\nNicaragua expresses its firm support for the theme that will guide our work throughout the seventy-fifth session, namely \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism\u201d. Having affected all countries, the pandemic has highlighted the need to create a new international economic model based on inclusion, equality and justice, prioritizing health as a universal human right and demanding that the resources allocated for war be made available for life and peace.\nIn the face of the pandemic, it is essential, for humanitarian reasons, that the principle of universality be applied so that Taiwan can participate in the corresponding mechanisms and meetings of the United Nations system.\nMr. President,\nLadies and gentlemen heads of delegation,\nTogether we must build a United Nations in the service of humankind. Building a better world is possible, and it is what all our peoples rightly demand.\nThank you very much, Mr. President."

        "file_text": "Mr. President of the General Assembly,\nMr. Secretary General,\nExcellences,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nOur unusual gathering today proves that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic changed the world as we know it. But this online form is an evidence we can adapt and act.\n75 years ago, this organization was built on a simple idea that the benefits of cooperation always prevail over selfishness and conflict. Today, we need this idea to become a reality more urgently than ever.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has quickly become a truly global threat. And it is far from over. But we already learned a lesson: We cannot go back to business as usual.\nThe COVID crisis exposed our weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Those already on the brink of poverty have been left poor. Those with difficult access to health care have found themselves helpless. And those with limited access to education have lost their hope for better future. Even stable and developed states faced great economic and social difficulties.\nOne of the most important lessons that we learned during the first months of COVID-19 is that ordinary people can achieve extraordinary things if they are led by SOLIDARITY and compassion. People around the world understood that responsible behaviour can save lives, even if it meant limitation of their own comfort. That they need to take their share of responsibility in protecting themselves and the others. I would even dare to say that this pandemic crisis brought the best out of us.\nIt is our responsibility as leaders to apply the same among nations. That's why we need true globalization of compassion. In concrete terms: we must not allow the development and production of vaccine and medical supplies to become yet another global competition. Because these are essential, life-saving commodities. And as such, their provision should be a sign of humanity, not a matter of economic profit. That is why we need to share information and foster partnerships among scientists, manufacturers and governments. And to provide to vaccine to anyone on this planet, regardless, whether they can afford it or not.\nIf we are to be successful in averting any crisis, we need RESPONSIBLE LEADERSHIP. Because ultimately it is the responsibility of governments and political leaders to make decisions that are based on facts and knowledge, and not on political calculations or selfish interests of those in power. Because the opposite \u2014 incompetence, disinformation or populism \u2014 has fatal consequences.\nResponsible leadership also means willingness to seethe common global interest. To preserve the best of existing architecture of international organizations and regimes of cooperation. Because these are often the drivers of effective solutions. I know that their work is not always perfect. But instead of resenting or defunding them, we need to find ways of how to improve them.\nAnd finally, the TRUST. The confidence of citizens in what their governments are doing is right. People need to know that they are protected and are not lied to.\nThe guardians of these principles must be the free and independent media, renowned experts and scientists, and active civil society. And our responsibility is to create an environment where they can work freely. If we are to attack them, we undermine our own ability to solve problems collectively. And we make our societies more vulnerable, including to disinformation and hoaxes, which have proven to be especially dangerous when they are related to health issues.\nThat is why we must not allow any crisis to become an excuse for suppressing human rights and liberties. We must make sure that any limitations must be proportionate, time-limited and legally sound. And these principles must be applied universally.\nUnfortunately, this is not always the case. Too often we see situations in the world, when people are intimidated, beaten or even threatened on their lives. Just as we recently saw in Belarus, or in the case of Alexei Navalnyj, and in many other cases. And only because they stood up for their rights. The spread of authoritarian disease is a threat to all of us.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nThere is one more remarkable lesson from COVID-19. We often hear that certain changes are impossible, or that it takes years to make them. This time, it was different.\nIt is the experience of how much and how quickly we can achieve if only we are willing to realise the common threat, change our behaviour and work together in order to prevent it. If we did it vis-a-vis COVID-19, we can do it also when it comes to other global threats, as well.\nMost notably the climate change, which is undoubtedly the greatest threat to our common future. Experts estimate, that by 2100 the climate change will be five times as deadly as COVID-19. We have been able to organize ourselves and create over 20 parallel teams worldwide to develop anti-COVID vaccine, because we lacked the so much needed knowledge. In climate change, we all know what to do. We just need to show a genuine will and act together, as one. To make it a real priority. And to let the science, innovations, but also solidarity and compassion lead the way.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nLet's make this lesson from COVID-19 the basis for our action in the future. Just like 75 years ago, the lesson of two world wars led to the universal commitment among nations to solve their disputes peacefully and to work together.\nLet us renew this commitment among us, and even take it further \u2014 along the mentioned principles of solidarity, responsibility and trust, and with the same resolve to act as we have shown during the current pandemic. Then, we can change any threat \u2014 be it COVID-19 or climate change \u2014 into an opportunity for the benefit of all.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "President of the 75th Session;\nSecretary-General;\nExcellencies;\nBula Vinaka from Fiji, Your Excellency, the President of the 75th General Assembly, Mr Bozkir, and congratulations on your election.\nFiji joined the United Nations in 1970, just three days after our Independence. But even as we mark Fiji\u2019s 50th Birthday alongside the United Nation\u2019s 75th Anniversary, any celebration feels hollow against the enormity of COVID-19\u2019s global spread and the worsening impacts of the climate emergency.\nIf there was ever a perfect storm of these dual crises, Fiji has seen it. This past April, in the midst of our campaign to contain an outbreak of the coronavirus, category 4 Cyclone Harold \u2014 already the third storm we had seen that season \u2014 made landfall at our shores.\nOur disaster authorities and health officials sprang into action, taking every step in-line with everything the experts could tell us about how to stop the spread of this highly contagious virus.\nAnd we saved lives from Harold\u2019s devastation, even evacuating entire communities, all without allowing a single new case in relation to the storm.\nThis was a turning point for Fiji \u2014 we knew that if we could overcome the virus in the harshest of conditions, it could be defeated. So we doubled down on our containment efforts, maintaining fast and early testing through our local WHO- certified laboratory. We either isolated or quarantined every close contact of every known case. We maintained a nationwide curfew and a complete lockdown of our two most populous cities. We have diligently managed travel through our border ever since, and the Fijian public has now been free of the coronavirus for over 150 days.\nOur doctors, our nurses, our contact tracers, our lab technicians and the members of our disciplined forces have fought tooth-and-nail for every day of that unbroken streak. And as I speak, they work in our quarantine centres, isolation wards, and at our border to allow our people to continue living without the virus in their midst.\nBut while Fiji has contained the coronavirus, we have not been spared its economic devastation. Our vital tourism sector, which constitutes upwards of 40 percent of our overall economy, along with other key sectors like our Garment Industry, came to a halt overnight, thrusting our economy into the most severe economic crisis in history.\nYet despite a catastrophic blow to Government revenues, we are committed to rebuilding from Cyclone Harold and building resilience to future storms and the rising seas. We must continue charting our path towards net-zero emissions and the aims of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. These are not choices, Mr President, they are matters of survival. But the development resources available to us are unaffordable and far too little in relation to the scale of our immense and pressing needs.\nClimate change and the coronavirus may be very different beasts, but the inequities they have exposed are all-too-familiar for small developing states. Once again, the worst impacts have fallen on us; those least equipped to bear them. Once again, our fate rests in the collective hands of the world \u2014 yet we still have zero guarantee of equitable access to a viable vaccine.\nIndeed, the divide between the highly-developed and developing worlds has never felt so stark. But once again, the UN Charter supplies us hope, as has the ferocious advocacy and leadership from my friend, the Secretary-General. 75 years ago, the UN\u2019s founding leaders recognised that no nation could know peace, no matter how responsibly and resolutely they act, unless all nations, large and small, did their part. The truth of that founding purpose is timeless \u2014 but it is clear that the multilateral system which emerged served the different needs of a different age. Mr President, this is not 1945. Our community of nations is larger, and so are the challenges we face. If climate change was not making that clear, this pandemic has made it painfully evident.\nWhile we trust that science will defeat COVID-19, just as it has defeated smallpox, polio, and other communicable diseases, our changing climate will define the \u201cnext normal\u201d post-COVID-19, becoming far deadlier before it ever abates.\nWe are already seeing a version of environmental Armageddon \u2014 from the massive, unprecedented fires in the American West, in Australia, and even in Scandinavia above the Arctic Circle which have devastated communities and infrastructure, turned iconic skylines orange, and scorched millions of acres of land. Just last week, Greenland lost a piece of its ice shelf that is larger than a number of small island nations.\nIf global climate action mirrors our incoherent global response to this pandemic, our children will see far greater horrors \u2014 we will not cap global temperature rise at either the 1.5-degree or 2-degree target, we will not stop our ocean ecosystems from becoming inhospitable, and we will not prevent a sixth mass extinction event.\nBillions or even trillions of dollars thrown at scientist\u2019s feet decades on from now will not produce a silver bullet that saves us from unmitigated climate impacts. That strategy may suffice for COVID-19, but solving a challenge as complex as climate change demands daily and enduring commitment that is already overdue. Our recovery from this pandemic must mark a transition to a decarbonized, climate- resilient economic system.\nThat is why Mr. President, Fiji has worked closely with the UN and our partners in Canada, Jamaica, the UK, the EU, and Rwanda through high-level engagement on financing for development to explore how we all recover faster. Recover better. Recover bluer. Recover greener. And recover together.\nIn the face of crushing financial pressure, Fiji has kept its sights set on the SDGs in every way we can afford. When our borders first shut, we immediately re prioritized finances through a COVID-19 Response Budget. Since then, we have launched another national budget which puts all resources we can muster behind as balanced, sustainable and inclusive a recovery as possible:\n-\tWe have allocated tens of millions of dollars in direct assistance to those left unemployed or who are working on reduced hours as a result of this pandemic;\n-\tEducation has remained free for every primary and secondary student in Fiji;\n-\tHealthcare in Government facilities has remained free for every Fijian;\n-\tWe have maintained our social protection for over 100,000 of our most vulnerable citizens, including the elderly, persons living with disabilities, rural pregnant mothers, and children from single-parent or destitute homes in need of care and protection;\n-\tNo Fijian has been cut-off from water because they cannot afford their bills. In fact, we are still expanding the life-changing benefits of renewable power to more of our people; adding to the over 800 Fijian communities already powered by solar home systems.\n-\tAlongside our development partners we are putting forward innovative solutions, including a new agro-solar project on our island of Ovalau, allowing the same land to be used for growing food and generating power;\n-\tWe\u2019re making higher education more accessible; with women composing a greater share of graduates from our tertiary institutions than their male peers;\n-\tIn under two years we have planted 2.3 million trees and mangroves as part of our commitment to grow 30 million trees in 15 years.\nAnd we soon plan to monetize the carbon captured by Fiji\u2019s forests in partnership with the World Bank.\n-\tWe have relocated five entire communities vulnerable to the rising seas, with over 40 more identified for relocation;\n-\tWe are expanding our marine protected areas and protecting new coral reef systems, while maintaining our moratorium on sea-bed mining for the decade;\n-\tWe are committed to net-zero emissions in shipping throughout the Pacific by 2050;\n-\tWe are building adaptive capacity by expanding access to information and technology to all our people, including in our most remote islands. Today, 95% of Fijians can access mobile broadband services.\nWe are creating j obs through the construction of cyclone-resilient infrastructure, extending roads and essential services to the most remote pockets of our islands. And where climate impacts have left trails of devastation, we are building back stronger.\nThere is so much more we can do \u2014 that we must do \u2014 to break the costly cycle of rebuilding from climate driven devastation and maintain the pace of our march towards a modern economy. To fund our full recovery, developing countries have asked for a mere ten per cent of the historic stimulus packages the richest nations have deployed for themselves.\nIf we do not bridge this gap; the economic wounds of this pandemic will fester and cracks of inequity will deepen, undermining hard-earned development gains and bringing economic catastrophe crashing down on the most vulnerable nations. All countries will be forced to reckon with the historic cost of that collapse.\nMr President, 2020 was meant to be the year we took back our planet; a superyear for nature, for the oceans, for the climate, for biodiversity, for food security, for the survival of all life on Earth.\nBut caught on our heels by this pandemic, every nation has fallen well short of their global commitments. Our recovery from COVID-19 is our last and best opportunity to set ourselves towards the future our children deserve.\nWe know that neither this global pandemic nor the climate emergency can be solved in the communities suffering the most from their devastation. The campaign for collective action must press ahead in parliaments, in board rooms, in stock exchanges and in the hearts and minds of ordinary citizens everywhere in the world; that work begins here, it begins with the United Nations.\nWhile they may stand emptier-than-usual today, the halls of the UNGA are where our global responses to COVID-19, climate change, and other defining causes of our time must take form \u2014 they are where our collective future will be forged. This great institution must remain the beating heart of global dignity, global security and global order.\nWhile there are changes we know must be made; Fijians still look to the UN as a beacon for hope, a force for peace and an anchor of stability. Fiji stands ready to serve our community of nations in every way we can, by way of peacekeeping, by way of our climate and oceans diplomacy, and by example, through the nation we build for ourselves.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "I am pleased to deliver this statement on behalf of His Excellency Mr. John Pombe Joseph Magufuli, President of the United Republic of Tanzania, who could not virtually join this meeting of the General Assembly owing to the ongoing general election campaign in the country. Mr. Magufuli is standing for a second presidential term in the 28 October elections. The Government of Tanzania would like to emphasize its resolve to ensure that this year\u2019s campaigns and elections are conducted in a democratic, peaceful, credible, fair and transparent manner, as Tanzania has done in all its elections without fail since 1965.\nThe United Republic of Tanzania extends its warm congratulations to you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly. I assure you of my delegation\u2019s full support and cooperation in discharging your noble mandate. I also want to pay tribute to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad- Bande, for the excellent leadership and commitment he demonstrated during his term of office in difficult times.\nIt was with great sadness that in July Tanzania lost one of its great leaders, the late Benjamin William Mkapa, former President of the United Republic of Tanzania, and I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to everyone for their condolences.\nThis year\u2019s general debate hinges on multilateralism, which matches very well with our major preoccupation of ensuring that no one is left behind. We welcome and fully endorse the theme for the general debate. You are taking on the presidency, Sir, during challenging times, as the world is battling through the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which is unprecedented. The outbreak and spread of COVID-19 around the world remind us that we need to enhance solidarity within the multilateral system to confront our global challenges. The pandemic has drastically claimed many lives and disrupted the economies of individual countries and the world at large. In that context, I would like to convey our heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families and loved ones of those who have passed away and to wish a quick recovery to those who are undergoing treatment. We also appreciate all the initiatives within the United Nations system aimed at mobilizing efforts to confront the pandemic, including sharing best practices to prevent it from spreading further.\nAt the national level, our Government has taken concerted and decisive actions to mitigate and prevent the spread of COVID-19 that have so far produced positive results in fighting the pandemic in our country. All socioeconomic activities have now been resumed normally. Despite these successes, we cannot deny the adverse effects that the pandemic has had in our country and the world at large, especially where the least-developed and developing countries are concerned. We express our sincere appreciation to our development partners, including the international financial institutions that have complemented our national efforts to combat the pandemic through debt relief, the postponement of debt payments and the provision of grants.\nIn the same spirit, Tanzania further urges international financial institutions and development partners to devise mechanisms to provide resources on unconditional terms to complement the efforts of the least-developed and developing countries in the fight against the pandemic, including, but not limited to, further debt-relief measures to enable them to revamp their economies more rapidly.\nAs we mark the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Organization, the United Republic of Tanzania would like to reaffirm its shared commitment to maintaining the pillars of the United Nations \u2014 peace and security, human rights and development. Tanzania\u2019s independence remains a remarkable testament to the commitment of our Organization to the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations. The United Nations was instrumental in facilitating our independence. Tanzania remains a committed member of the United Nations, and through the Special Political and Decolonization Committee has supported the liberation struggles of many fellow States in their fight to regain their independence. Over the years, Tanzania has also participated in promoting the pillars of the United Nations in matters of peace and security and in working towards the sustainable future that we are all hope to see. We are proud to have participated under the umbrella of the United Nations in peacekeeping operations. Tanzania currently has more than 2,303 peacekeepers serving in six missions, and we believe that peace and security are the cornerstone of our socioeconomic development.\nThere is no question that multilateralism is an important tool for collaboration among nations, as the United Nations has ably demonstrated. As we enter the Decade of Action for implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we continue to believe that the United Nations is ultimately the right platform for addressing global challenges. In implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the current Government of Tanzania has accomplished a number of achievements in various sectors. Our national economy is growing at a rate of 6.9 per cent, as compared to 6.2 per cent in 2015. However, COVID-19 resulted in a lower growth projection to 5.5 per cent, creating our need for relief to support a more vibrant economic growth projection. Inflation rates have remained stable at a single digit of 4.4 per cent, with the lowest rate recorded at 3.4 per cent in 2019. As a result, on 1 July the World Bank announced the upgrade of Tanzanian economy from least-developed to lower-middle-income status, five years before the national development vision\u2019s projection of 2025. That milestone is the result of different national measures, mainly focused on clamping down on corruption, improving public administration and the proper management of public and natural resources. It has also been made possible by the Government\u2019s reforms and partnerships with various development partners. We therefore would like to express our sincere gratitude to the United Nations and its specialized agencies, funds and programmes and other development partners.\nIn our efforts to integrate economic and human development, we have made progress in improving the infrastructure necessary for the provision of social services. For instance, in the past five years we have built a total of 1,769 health-care facilities around the country, ranging from dispensaries to referral hospitals. Additionally, the construction and renovation of water infrastructure has led to improved access to clean and safe water for 70.1 per cent of the population in rural areas and 84 per cent in urban areas. Rural electrification has provided a total of 9,112 of Tanzania\u2019s 12,268 villages with electricity.\nTwenty-five years after the adoption of the Beijing Platform, inequality still looms large in the world. Despite the challenges that remain, Tanzania has been able to put in place various national frameworks to guide the implementation of measures ensuring gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, including mainstreaming gender equality objectives in all Government policies and programmes. In terms of promoting the right to education, the Government has also overseen major construction and rehabilitation of learning and teaching facilities, as well as the provision of free education in primary and secondary schools. That has raised primary school enrolment from 1 million students in 2015 to 1.6 million in 2020. Consequently, the number of students enrolled in secondary school has also increased from 1.6 million in 2015 to 2.1 million this year.\nThe Government has enhanced interconnectedness and has managed to build 3,500 kilometres of roads and numerous large bridges in the past five years. Moreover, we have upgraded major ports and other transport facilities, ranging from the standard-gauge railway that runs through central Tanzania to the restoration of other railway transport facilities in the eastern corridor. Other milestones include the manufacture and refurbishing of ships to improve water transport and connectivity in areas surrounded by bodies of water. The Government has also overseen the procurement of 11 aeroplanes, of which eight are operating commercially.\nIn an effort to build the industrial economy in Tanzania, we have embarked on the establishment of 8,477 new industries in the large, medium and small categories. That has gone hand in hand with the construction of a major hydroelectric power plant on the Rufiji River that will have the capacity to provide 2,115 megawatts of electricity, enough to boost our energy supply for industry. Our blueprint for the industrial economy and human development seeks to address infrastructure and regulatory hurdles and thereby create a smart, functional and fair investment and business regulatory regime. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to invite and encourage international investors to come and invest in various sectors in Tanzania. We have a stable and favourable investment environment and look forward to welcoming everyone.\nAt this point I would like to expound on a number of issues that my Government feels require particular international attention and are therefore necessary to emphasize.\nWe should remind ourselves that the credibility of the United Nations rests on a well-represented and responsive Security Council. In that respect, we reiterate the Common African Position, as elaborated in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.\nOn 17 August, Tanzania handed over the chairmanship of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to Mozambique. Tanzania is proud to have served SADC for a period of one year amid a number of challenges, while reaching milestones in the areas of peace and security, democracy, good governance, financial integration and social development. Those achievements reflect the commitment that Tanzania has always had and continues to spearhead in efforts related to regional integration and international relations.\nOn 25 October 2019, Tanzania joined other SADC countries in commemorating the day of solidarity with the Republic of Zimbabwe against sanctions in Zimbabwe. We continue to call for the removal of all forms of unilateral coercive measures in the form of sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe to pave the way for that country\u2019s socioeconomic transformation and economic development.\nThe swearing-in in June of His Excellency Mr. Evariste Ndayishimiye, President of the Republic of Burundi, was the culmination of the long-awaited presidential elections in Burundi. With the elections\u2019 peaceful conclusion, Tanzania urges the international community to assist the new Government by providing much needed aid for the economic and social development of the citizens of Burundi and the region at large.\nTanzania reiterates its position of support for a stable, peaceful and prosperous Democratic Republic of the Congo. We commend the efforts made so far by the United Nations, the SADC region and the whole international community to make it happen. In that regard, we also want to stress that continued and pragmatic engagement is crucial in order to align SADC\u2019s position with the reconfiguration of the Force Intervention Brigade, so as to maintain its effective defence capability, operational effectiveness and command-and-control unit.\nTanzania has always expressed the view that the economic embargo imposed on Cuba in 1960 has outlived its relevance. We encourage both parties to engage in constructive dialogue aimed at achieving its total removal.\nOn the question of Palestine, we continue to support the resolution of the conflict between Israel and Palestine, which hinges on a two-State solution in which both live side by side in peace and security.\nI would like to conclude by pledging to the Assembly that the United Republic of Tanzania will continue to render the necessary support to the United Nations in ensuring success in all important global agendas, including the promotion of the equality and self-determination of nations, peace and security, human rights, development, the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the United Nations reform processes. Once again, we reiterate our commitment to multilateralism and call on all Member States to embrace it for a just and better world. God bless the United Republic of Tanzania, God bless Africa, God bless the United Nations and God bless us all."

        "file_text": "Your Excellency, President of the 75th Session of the General Assembly, Your Excellencies Heads of State and Government,\nYour Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, the Secretary General of the United Nations,\nDistinguished Delegates,\nLadies and Gentlemen.\nMr. President,\nIt affords me great pleasure to congratulate you on your election to direct the work of this historic 75th session of the General Assembly. Such an honour bears testimony to your undoubted dynamism and diplomatic skills, which will in no small measure positively affect the outcome of the work of this Assembly. I assure you of my delegation\u2019s full support and co-operation in all your endeavours during your tenure of office.\nPermit me also to pay tribute to your predecessor, Professor Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, for his outstanding leadership of the 74th session. We congratulate him also on the many initiatives that he took in the furtherance of the work of our Organization during arguably the most challenging session in this century.\nTo Secretary General Antonio Guterres, I extend my country\u2019s gratitude and support for the sterling work he continues to do against great odds. We particularly commend him for his efforts and commitment in transforming the United Nations development system. We also recognize his tireless efforts in the daunting task of strengthening and streamlining the peace and security architecture to better integrate prevention, peace-making and peacebuilding. The energy towards a global ceasefire during the pandemic is worthy of special mention.\nMr. President\nI wish to acknowledge this session\u2019s theme: \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need; reaffirming our commitment to multilateralism\u201d that is not only apt but also greatly inspired.\nThree quarters of a century ago, our forebears came together in San Francisco and signed the Charter of the United Nations.\nThis Session therefore marks the commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the creation of the United Nations. We do so at a critical time and juncture in human history, which calls for true reflection on the role of the United Nations in the 21st century \u2014 the organization upon which humanity continues to place so much faith and hope for a better life for all.\nSince that time, the United Nations has been, and will always be, the symbol of humankind\u2019s fervent desire to conduct its affairs for eternal survival. The UN has achieved and made significant strides in addressing many of the serious challenges facing the International Community. When the dark clouds of war threatened to engulf the world with a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions, humankind found the strength within itself to negate the Armageddon. We also recall that the UN played a significant role in easing the pangs of decolonization.\nThe purpose and principles of the UN Charter continue to be relevant today as they were seventy-five years ago. The United Nations has had to grapple with crisis situations in many parts of the world in pursuance of its mandate to maintain international peace and security. As today\u2019s problems grow ever more global, multilateralism and solidarity are more important than ever. We should remain steadfast against the re-emerging threats on multilateralism and global cooperation. We believe that a coherent and feasible strategy for the future, committed resources, streamlining priorities combined with responsible and inspired leadership are the prerequisites to achieving a relevant and vital UN for the future. This will go a long way towards fulfilling the ideals for which the UN was formed.\nMr. President\nLesotho reaffirms its commitment to advance a collective vision of an effective United Nations to ensure a prosperous and lasting future for all our peoples.\nThe world is indeed witnessing a revolution in information systems and their integration into the lives of men, women and children. There can be no doubt that for some, information technology and globalization are beginning to turn theoretical possibilities into fact, as the use of computers and computer-dependent systems have resulted in improvements in basic health conditions and increases in life expectancy, efficiency and productivity. Unfortunately, the majority, who have been left out of that prosperity continue to live in conditions of extreme poverty. The challenge for the UN of the 21st century is to eliminate those disparities by bringing poor countries into the digital age.\nMr. President\nThis historic session of the UNGA comes at a sensitive time when the world is faced with the deadly COVID-19 pandemic which has caused economic stagnation, loss of jobs and many fatalities across the globe. This has posed serious challenges to our Organization and exposed weaknesses and vulnerabilities in societies and economies around the world.\nThe virus attacks all regardless of ethnicity, faith, affluence or nationality. In conflict ridden areas the situation is dire due to health systems that have collapsed. On this note we commend the Secretary General for calling for a global ceasefire in all corners of the world. We support his determination and commitment in the fight against this pandemic. Lesotho believes the international community should collectively adopt measures that are focused on a holistic approach and close coordination within the UN to contain the spread of the virus. Measures against future pandemics, should include ease of access to vaccines, medication and essential equipment. Pandemics respect neither internal nor external borders. Cooperation and collaboration across and among nations, including the essential pillars of multilateralism becomes more essential than ever.\nMr. President\nThe coronavirus plague has escalated the vulnerability of people in need and has created fear and despair amongst people living under oppressed circumstances. We condemn all acts that result in displacement of women and children.\nLesotho recognizes the leadership of the Under-Secretary-General and Executive Director of UN-Women, for her exceptional work in leading global efforts for Improving the living standards and the rights of women and in particular, the inception of the Gender in Humanitarian Action Programme for COVID-19. We commend all efforts to mobilize the UN system, along with all relevant United Nations Agencies that are helping in humanitarian and security interventions.\nMr. President\nLesotho welcomes and appreciates the 2019/2020 Secretary General\u2019s trenchant progress report towards the sustainable development goals and aligns herself with the principle of leaving no one behind. The report reveals that there has been some considerable progress in the implementation of SDGs, however, it is trite that the international community is not on track to deliver by 2030.\nIt is also shocking to learn that the number of people suffering from hunger and malnutrition increased especially in countries in special situations like Lesotho during the reporting period, while at the same time climate change is reported to be occurring much faster than anticipated.\nWe are meeting here, though virtually, at an opportune time during the commemoration of the UN\u2019s 75th anniversary, which coincides with the decade of action that is intended to increase the momentum and implementation efforts on SDGs. Indeed, our commitment to strengthen partnerships and international cooperation has never been so critical to provide solutions to our collective global challenges.\nBy virtue of being a least developed and landlocked country, characterized by a weak macroeconomy and fragile fiscal policy space, Lesotho will bear a major socio economic brunt of the pandemic and thus remain at high risk of being further left behind.\nMr. President\nDevastated by coronavirus and weakened health systems Lesotho may not achieve the SDG on Health. In this vein, we call on development partners, the United Nations and International Financial Institutions to support the LLDCs, LDCs, SIDs and similar vulnerable states, such as Lesotho, with the necessary resources to respond to this crisis, in commitment to leaving no one behind.\nWhile Lesotho recognizes that equitable and quality education is part of human development, I regret to inform this august virtual gathering that the current pandemic is creating an education emergency that is having devastating impacts on children in my country. The abrupt closure of schools for over four months is undoubtedly expected to lead to a decline in education outcomes. In fact, UNESCO warns that schools\u2019 closure has the potential for increased drop-out rates which will disproportionately affect adolescent girls, further entrench gender gaps in education and lead to increased risk of sexual exploitation, early pregnancy and early forced marriages. This scenario has negative outcomes on achieving SDGs related to education, poverty, health and gender.\nMr. President\nClimate change continues to be a key challenge to our efforts towards achieving sustainable development. Member States of the UN possess different levels of capacities and resources to address the causes and effects of climate change. In light of all these, Lesotho calls for urgent action at the global level and within the UN Development System to mobilize for crisis response and to set the world on the collective path for resilient, substantive and sustainable recovery.\nMr. President\nThe unfortunate but inescapable scale-back of the work of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW64) due to the pandemic has hindered progress and showcasing of best practices by member states. Nonetheless, we are pleased that in March this year, the General Assembly adopted a Political Declaration which coincided with the 25th Anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (BPFA) which remains the comprehensive and transformative agenda for the achievement of gender equality and empowerment of women and girls. Since its adoption in 1995, we have undeniably made significant advances on women and girl\u2019s rights.\nIn Lesotho, we are making progress in the representation of women in leadership roles. There is a significant representation at the decision-making levels including in the private sector.\nMr. President\nLesotho remains convinced that the United Nations is the only universal institution that can safeguard world peace and ensure the survival of all. As we stop to ponder and reflect on the past, a new pattern of ethnic intra-state conflagrations are emerging and new dimensions have become increasingly important in international security. These include; proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, illicit arms trade and trafficking, drug trafficking, strains on the conflict resolution and peacebuilding efforts, threats of social and economic injustice and the plight of migrants, refugees and internally displaced persons. At the same time, racism is rearing its ugly head in some parts of the world, threatening immeasurable gains of civilization.\nThe record of the United Nations in the recent past in peacekeeping has been mixed. We have had unqualified success in some places, but then in others success has eluded us. Our resolve, therefore, would be, to ensure that our machinery for peace making and peacekeeping is fine-tuned to maximum precision.\nFirst, the financing of peacekeeping operations must be put on a more secure footing. Persistent arrears, such as those we have experienced recently, cannot but have an adverse effect on the peacekeeping efforts of our Organization.\nSecondly, greater attention should be paid to peace-making and preventive diplomacy, thereby reducing the prospects of conflicts, with their attendant costs. The strategy of pre-empting the eruption of conflict is, of course, closely linked to the United Nations efforts in the fields of social and economic development, because it is in the soil of poverty that the seeds of national upheavals take root and sprout. Last, but not least, the changed nature of the challenges facing the Security Council call for the restructuring of that organ to reflect the changed realities of present-day international relations. Most of the international peace-and-security matters with which the Council is currently seized pertain to developing countries or countries in transition. Thus, it is reasonable to suggest that the composition of the Security Council should include an appropriate proportion of developing countries in both the permanent and non permanent categories in line with the Ezulwini Consensus.\nThe Intergovernmental Negotiations on the reform of the Council has continued to address the Question of Equitable Representation on an increase in the Membership of the Security Council. It is encouraging to note that discussions have shown a general support for the need to increase the membership of the Security Council, especially of developing countries, and a subsequent need to review the Council\u2019s composition. The general view is that the size and composition of an expanded Council should reflect more accurately the universal character of the United Nations and present-day realities. It has further been recognized that the principle of the sovereign equality of all Members of the United Nations and the concepts of equitable representation and distribution, legitimacy, effectiveness and efficiency should serve as guiding principles for the reform of the Security Council.\nMr. President\nSeveral political questions continue to preoccupy us. The people of Israel and the Palestinians have overcome formidable obstacles. Yet the most difficult and divisive issues still remain unresolved. The peace process in that area of the Middle East is of utmost importance and must therefore be negotiated against a backdrop of continuing and satisfactory progress. We urge the international community to respond quickly, appropriately, generously, practically and flexibly to the needs of the Palestinian people with the centrality of their inalienable right to sovereignty in focus. Achievements must match expectations.\nOver the past 29 years, the U.N. General Assembly has passed, to no avail, an annual vote condemning the economic, commercial and financial blockade of Cuba. As a result, the people of Cuba have been subjected to undue hardship, which has been relentless even during the global pandemic that required international humanitarian cooperation.\nWe renew our call for the lifting of this embargo that has had a negative impact on that country\u2019s economy and brought hardship to the Cuban people.\nIn Africa, many significant developments have taken place in respect of peacekeeping that have to be understood in the context of changes in the international environment. Western countries have launched several initiatives aimed at identifying ways in which the international community can assist Africa to cope with the challenges of conflict prevention and management. While Africa, in keeping with its determination to combat conflicts on the continent, is appreciative of these gestures from its outside partners, we wish to remind the international community of the United Nations\u2019 primary role as the guardian of world peace and stability everywhere, including in Africa.\nThe determination of Africa to address, through the AU, the problem of conflicts on the continent should not be misconstrued as absolving the United Nations from its responsibility for peace and security where Africa is concerned.\nThe situation in Western Sahara also merits our attention. The General Assembly has consistently reaffirmed the inalienable right of the people of Western Sahara to self determination. We express our disappointment at the lack of progress in this regard. Twenty-nine years have passed since the Security Council approved the Settlement Plan and subsequently established the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), with the mandate to implement the plan. It is therefore unfortunate that the self-determination referendum has not been held and the Security Council appears reluctant to use all diplomatic tools at its disposal to ensure compliance with the peace plan. Lesotho will continue to stand with the people of Western Sahara in their quest for independence.\nIn conclusion, my delegation looks forward to close collaboration with you and all other Member States over the next year to advance a collective vision of a truly representative and effective United Nations to ensure a prosperous and lasting future for all our peoples.\nI THANK YOU"

        "file_text": "Excellency,\nI begin my intervention by paying tribute to the men and women worldwide who have been selflessly holding the line of defense against COVID-19 to care and protect our loved ones, risking their own lives in so doing. I also honor the memory of the many who have died to date and who are dying even as we speak, unfortunate victims of this insidious virus.\nIn Belize, we are working assiduously to contain its spread. Indeed we have closed borders, imposed curfews, mandated the use of masks and social distancing, quarantined infected persons and searched out and tested persons who have come in contact with persons known to have been carrying the virus.\nWhile a health calamity has been avoided thus far we are suffering the worse economic shock in the history of our country.\nBelize is a tourism dependent, export oriented country. Invariably, therefore, when the travel and tourism industry shutdown and the market for agro products is depressed, our economy flounders. To date 73 per cent of workers in our tourism sector, which is the most labour intensive sector in our economy, have lost their jobs. Seemly simultaneously, my country is now beset with both a health crisis and an economic crisis. In order to deal with the health crisis, government established a bipartisan National Oversight Committee (NOC) with broad supervisory responsibility for Belize\u2019s COVID-19 response and recovery initiatives, including initiatives to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on society and economy.\nThe NOC was chaired by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. It has representation from the churches, private sector, civil society and trade unions. Government also established a COVID-19 Task Force, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer in the Ministry of Human Development and Social Transformation. Frontline agencies and other social partners are included on the Task Force. This Task Force manages the day to day public health response and communications. Regretfully, in June 2020, the Leader of the Opposition resigned from the NOC.\nMy government took immediate steps to shore up health facilities, and, at the same time, put in place measures to ease the economic blow to Belizeans including through the introduction of a $10-million programme of food assistance and a US$24.5m programme for unemployment relief.\nIn terms of economic stimulus, the Government has launched programmes to animate the most impacted sectors of the economy including the extension of $7.25-million line of credit to micro, small and medium enterprises; and provision of wage subsidies to promote employee retention, and provision of a $5-million Special Line of Credit for Tourism Stakeholders. We have also launched an Economic Recovery Strategy which rests on 5 pillars namely: Supporting Business Recovery, Creating a Business Climate for Growth, Improving Government Efficiency, Strengthening of Productive Sectors and Agriculture, and Growing our Emerging Economy.\nBut all those efforts and initiative are puny in comparison to the magnitude of the impact of the pandemic. Economic growth is expected to contract by some 20 to 25 per cent, which is as much as three times the global average. And, we are still not sure that we have seen the worse of this pandemic.\nIt is worthy of note that, pre-COVID-19 Belize was contending with economic decline caused by ongoing climate impacts such as a prolonged drought and its impact on primary sector output, along with continued challenges caused by sargassum inundation on our marine spaces. Then on September 4, Hurricane Nana struck us inflicting another blow to our beleaguered agricultural sector.\nTruly we are presently caught in the cross hairs of two grave crises with hardly more than our own limited natural resources and our determination to survive to bolster our position.\nRegretfully, the international response to the COVID pandemic, not unlike its response to the climate catastrophe, continues to be tepid with the weaker nations and peoples having to bear the brunt of the ravages of the global missteps.\nBlame is superceding coordination and cooperation; platitudes supercede support for the vulnerable. These two crises lay bare the systemic ineptitude of the global financial and economic institutions and the inequity of their rules and decision making procedures. While the rich and the powerful nations are fixated on the preservation of their competitive advantage, they are seemingly heedless of the failures of those institutions and the suffering of the people whose needs they are ostensibly designed to cater to.\nThe consequences of global missteps are particularly evident in small island developing states worldwide.\nAnd even though we are the least culpable for these missteps, we are the most affected by their consequences. We are forced to pay in the debilitating debt we must absorb because of an antiquated notion that development is measured by income per capita with no regard for our endemic vulnerability. We pay in the lost decades of development and development potential as temperatures rise and so too the seas around us. And now in the face of the pandemic, the main global policy options being paraded before us would have us pay for our recovery. This, Mr. President, is the gravest of social injustices that the United Nations cannot afford to perpetuate.\nSimply put, none of us have the luxury of time to repeat the follies of the past in the false hope that they will produce different results. The bush fires on the West Coast of the United States, the hyperactive Atlantic hurricane season, drought in Central America, the flooding of Africa and this global pandemic are stark reminders that we are fast approaching the limits of planetary sustainability for human survival. Science gives us a decade, if that much, to course correct. The stakes could not be higher \u2014 they include all that the United Nations in its seventy five years has worked towards including the vaunted 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the Paris Agreement. Multilateralism is on the frontline.\nTo us in Belize, the next steps for the United Nations are manifest.\nThe pandemic has emphasized our interconnectivity and our collective vulnerability. It is imperative that the international community come together and rally behind the vision of the Charter to advance the dignity of all human beings in larger freedom.\nThe pandemic has also revealed the entrenched duality between the haves and the have nots. The international community must therefore elevate the protection of the most vulnerable as its highest priority.\nThe pandemic has provided a preview of the risks we are all exposed to if we continue business as usual. We must therefore as nations rise up in unison to the challenge to reset the global trajectory for planet and people, in line with what we have already agreed to do under our multilateral agenda: eradicate poverty, secure our climate future, and ensure human rights and justice for all.\nOn behalf of Belize and the small island developing states we represent I wish to put forward a five point action agenda for the United Nations.\nFirst, let us get the recovery right.\nThe tragedy of COVID-19 is symptomatic of the tragedy of the commons. We are pushing our planetary boundaries beyond what is sustainable for humanity, threatening our own health as much as that of the earth. This is occurring on land and in the ocean. Our recovery from COVID-19 is an opportunity to accelerate our recovery from the unsustainable use of planetary resources and build our resilience to future shocks.\nThe Secretary-General of the United Nations has championed six climate- related actions to shape the recovery and the work ahead.\nAt the core, these principles are about people. They are about promoting job security, and healthy environments. They are about sustaining growth and transitioning to a climate resilient environmentally sensitive global economy.\nThese principles if operationalized, will take us well beyond recovery and set us on a pathway that will jumpstart our climate rescue and safeguard our children\u2019s future.\nThat future depends on holding global warming to well below 1.5 C.\nTherefore as a second challenge, we must keep pressure on major emitters to increase their climate ambition and accelerate climate action for 1.5C.\n2020 is the deadline to bring forward new climate plans with strengthened targets for climate action and a strategy to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. But we are yet to see the level of ambition needed to bend the emissions curve and close the mitigation gap for 1.5. Belize commends China for its announcement to pursue a path of carbon neutrality by 2060 and looks forward to its forthcoming climate plans. It is imperative that those with historic responsibility to now walk the walk. Belize urges the United Kingdom as the incoming President of the twenty-sixth climate change conference, the European Union, and the United States of America to put their best plans forward before we close out the year.\nAs Belize stated in the Placencia Ambition Forum, small island developing states resolve to deliver their own ambitious climate plans and indeed we have been the trailblazers. Belize too will be coming forward with its climate plan. Our nationally determined contribution will feature our commitment to enhance nature based solutions amid the growing global awareness of the potential of ecosystems to contribute to raising climate ambition and foster sustainable development.\nNature based solutions rely on the viability of ecosystems and the biodiversity they support. It is for this reason that the United Nations must as a third challenge address the urgency of protecting biodiversity.\nBiodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation like climate change are occurring at unprecedented rates. This acceleration has resulted in and will continue to precipitate irreversible harm to the earth systems. If we fail to stop and reverse this trend, the damage to global economic, social and political resilience and stability will be significant and will render achieving the SDGs impossible.\nIn recognition of this crisis, Belize has joined the Leader\u2019s Pledge for Nature which sets out urgent actions to be taken within the next decade to \u201cput nature and biodiversity on a path to recovery by 2030\u201d.\nAs a part of that pledge, we are committed to finalizing as a matter of priority the high seas treaty on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity. While the high seas covers nearly two-thirds (64%) of the world\u2019s ocean, only around one percent of those waters are protected today. Such a vast area of the planet warrants protection to conserve biodiversity and maintain a healthy ocean.\nI invite all to join the Leader\u2019s Pledge, and endorse its actions as a part of our global commitment to the UN Decade for Action on Sustainable Development.\nAs is evident from the foregoing actions, our objective whether it is in recovering better, increasing climate ambition, or reversing biodiversity loss, is to safeguard the sustainable development agenda.\nCOVID-19 has changed the script on the Decade of Action on Sustainable Development. Just like a hurricane, this pandemic has been cataclysmic. Years of hard-earned development gains have vanished. Worse yet, for countries like my own, we are concerned that the global policy responses and the paucity in action on persistent challenges from climate to biodiversity will entrench poverty. In no uncertain terms, we face a development emergency.\nJust as we must be sure to match our stimulus to our climate goals, we must do the same for our development goals. The integrated nature of our actions cannot be underestimated. For this reason, Belize in its capacity as the Chair of the Alliance of Small Island States has advocated that we use the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development together with the SAMOA Pathway and other internationally agreed development goals to chart our way forward out of the challenges we face. We need no reinvention. What we need is implementation and with that a renewed commitment to resuscitate our collective development goals. But because the pandemic has thrown some of us further afield from the SDG track, we also need to lend a hand to those whose legs have been completely cut from under them.\nThe fourth challenge I put to the United Nations is to give credence to the principle of leaving no one behind.\nSmall island developing states like Belize are engaging in a debt-fueled recovery to salvage any chance for our sustainable development because we do not qualify for concessionary finance. The denial of access to that finance amounts to a breach of the international commitment to support the special case of SIDS.\nPer capita income can no longer define whether SIDS can access finance. It is high time that we finally replace the perverse income-based criteria with a robust vulnerability based criteria that looks at levels of poverty, indebtedness, and exposure to natural disasters and external shocks. AOSIS has called upon the Secretary-General to finally deliver a multi-dimensional vulnerability index which is some twenty-five years overdue.\nAs we have stated in the forum for Financing for Development in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond, traditional development tools have proven to be ineffective and COVID-19 continues to prove that point. New development tools need to be created or existing ones adapted. Inclusive and tailored measures for SIDS with a focus on debt relief, cancellation and restructuring are urgently needed.\nMy country as Chair of the AOSIS therefore calls for a SIDS Compact for Access to Finance with specific policy options that would address:\n~ liquidity, solvency and enable a green, resilient recovery for SIDS ~ efficient access to finance as well as increased mobilization and expanded provision of concessionary and grant based finance\n~ innovative sources of finance and facilitated private sector engagement for SIDS; and\n~ Increased access to climate finance to address imminent needs of SIDS for adaptation and to address loss and damage as a result of irreversible impacts of climate change\nThis SIDS Compact is for all small island developing states, no matter where we fall on the anachronistic development chain. Any barrier that results in exclusions must be eliminated. In that connection Belize adds its voice once more to the overwhelming call and respectfully demand the complete rejection of unilateral coercive measures that have been imposed on our sister island, Cuba. Despite Cuba\u2019s hardships, its historic humanitarian commitment and ethos of service and solidarity were again demonstrated by its deployment of the medical personnel of the Henry Reeve Brigade in many countries, including Belize, to our assist in our efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe stand by the conviction that we are sovereign equals, and that all peoples without discrimination, without exception, must benefit from the promise of the Charter, to the rights therein including the right to self-determination.\nThis right to self determination is also applicable to the people of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and their continued exclusion from the UN and its institutions is contrary to the goals of the organisation. Belize calls for the full participation of Taiwan in the UN system. It is manifest that they possess the capacity so to do as exemplified in their successful and effective approach to COVID-19 and their outreach to allied and other countries.\nBelize would also wish to reiterate its solidarity with the Palestinian people, who continue to suffer under illegal occupation; we fully support their aspirations for an independent state, within its 1967 borders, with all attendant rights. We urge Israel to continue to work towards the realisation of the dream for a two state solution.\nThis brings me finally to the fifth challenge \u2014 reform.\nMr President,\nSince the reckoning of the Millennium Development Goals, one narrative has been clear and unchanged. While there has been progress, that progress has been uneven. I do not expect any difference will come with the Sustainable Development Goals if we continue without purposeful reform of our institutions to level the multilateral playing field.\nAs the 2008 financial crisis and the emerging trend of responses to the COVID 19 crisis portend, our contemporary multilateral institutions including the global financial institutions embody a systemic bias for those with more power. This has resulted in the forging of global policies that succumb to the pressure of power politics, and a further marginalization of already vulnerable groups.\nDisappointingly so, the members of the AOSIS have seen this time and again as we have tirelessly advocated for collective and ambitious climate action with an urgency of now and all we have to show for it is incremental progress.\nThis has led many of our small island developing states to ponder whether indeed we will be seated in this General Assembly to celebrate the UN\u2019s centenary. As President Kabua of the Marshall Islands recently stated: \u201cIn the face of the planet\u2019s existential challenge, the United Nations members must contemplate the future that inaction will bring \u2014 one in which the ranks of this noble institution may be diminished.\u201d\nSystemic change is needed. Multilateral systems and institutions must be reformed to be more inclusive and to advance a vision of shared responsibility and shared prosperity. The voices of the marginalized must be centralized. The policy of exclusion and exceptionalism that has been the bane of multilateralism must be replaced with a policy of inclusion.\nMr. President,\nBelize continues to pursue its peaceful and just settlement of the Guatemala Claim to our country by participating fully in the legal process at the International Court of Justice.\n2020 is humanity\u2019s defining moment.\nWe have witnessed the rampant injustices that people even in the greatest of nations amongst us continue to suffer.\nWe have had to come to terms with the fallacies of our institutions and their winner take all policies.\nBut all is not doom and gloom.\nWe have learned from the sacrifice of our frontline workers, our heroes, that in the end what matters is compassion, and the selfless task of looking out for one another.\nMultilateralism is on the frontline but I am confident that we will arise from this dark moment stronger and more resilient as nations unite."

        "file_text": "Mr. President UN Secretary-General Excellencies Distinguished Delegates\nAt the outset allow me to share warm greetings from the Government and the people of the Republic of Kiribati. In the name of the Almighty God, I begin by sharing his peace and blessings. Kam na bane n Mauri!\nAcknowledgement\nMr. President,\nI join previous speakers in congratulating you, on your election to the Presidency of the 75th Session of the United Nations. I wish you every success as you guide our deliberations by making the United Nations of family relevant to all members.\nOn this note, I wish to assure you of Kiribati\u2019s full support, as you discharge your duties for the Assembly, and avail my Government\u2019s commitment, both morally and in kind, in particular for initiatives that seek to make our planet earth, a resilient, healthier, and safer home. This is the core of Kiribati\u2019s Vision for 20 Years (KV20) in line with our efforts to implement our agreed 2030 Agenda.\nContextualizing the Theme\nMr. President,\nThe theme for this 75th session, reminds us that the effectiveness of our individual national agendas, can be greatly enhanced through stronger global cooperation. By reaffirming our collective efforts to enhance links between our governments, our multilateral institutions, we can work together to create a resilient, healthy and peaceful future for our respective peoples. This is critical, especially with the emergence of unprecedented challenges such as climate change, natural disasters and the recent COVID-19 pandemic.\nMr. President,\nOn this note, I would like to express my deepest condolences to our brothers and sisters around the world who are suffering from the impacts of the global pandemic. These are difficult and uncertain times, which calls for stronger cooperation and reminds us of the strength we have in unity. It also reminds us of the United Nations we need- one that can step up in difficult and challenging times. A United Nations that undertakes to deliver and coordinate assistance and support. In particular to our most vulnerable communities and the least developed amongst us, through its agencies, programs and multilateral systems, in a coordinated and timely manner.\nIt also extends to all of us, as individual sovereign States; as global corporations; as non-government and civil society organizations; as cities, towns and villages; as families and individual human beings. From small islands in the Pacific, to megacities and metropolitans in Europe and America. We have a calling as Leaders to work together to address our most pressing global challenges.\nMr. President,\nDuring this difficult time, our remoteness and isolated location has allowed my country to be among the few fortunate nations, currently free from the reaches of this virus. But that has been our only advantage. The temporary suspension of flights into Kiribati, and strict measures to contain our borders from the virus, has also resulted in unprecedented challenges. Many of our nationals are currently stranded in other countries such as Fiji, New Zealand and Australia, as well as other parts of the world, due to the containment measures imposed to limit the spread of this deadly virus. I am thankful to these Governments for the cooperation and support they have given to my people as they await repatriation to their home country. While many countries have already begun to repatriate their nationals, my Government remains in crisis due to the absence of adequate infrastructure and capacity to isolate our nationals upon their return. A few months ago, I declared a State of Public Health Emergency, calling for assistance from our partners to enhance and strengthen our public health sector and to assist with any other necessary actions required to mitigate the economic and social shocks of COVID-19.\nMr. President,\nI am optimistic that we can overcome this challenge, if we work together, as members of the United Nations family. My government remains grateful for the support of our development partners namely Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, contributing 12.5 million AUD towards our preparations and efforts to mitigate the economic and social impacts emerging at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe also acknowledge the support provided by the United Arab Emirates through its assistance package to the Pacific; and the Government of India through the United Nations India Partnership Fund; the Canadian Fund for Local Initiatives response to COVID-19; and USAID for the donation of ventilators; and the medical supplies and protective equipment delivered through the Pacific humanitarian air service- funded by Australia, UN agencies, the Red Cross and USAID.\nMr. President, I remain grateful and optimistic in the strength and partnership of our United Nations family. In challenging times, such partnerships are needed more than ever, and I implore our UN family who are able to do so, to increase their support to confront COVID \u2014 a future that focuses on poverty alleviation, social inclusion, and leaves no one behind\nMr. President\nAs leaders, we are charged with a noble responsiblity to take action today, to shape the future of tomorrow. Poverty and inequality remains humanity\u2019s biggest dilemma and challenge. The social and economic security of any nation can only be strengthened, if the support system begins at home. It is therefore critical, that the UN programs targets the family, at a household level, from where the fragmentation of values, draws a fault line in our societies.\nLike other governments, our people are our most precious resource. During these difficult times, the protection and welfare of the most vulnerable individuals and groups take centre stage. We are providing COVID-19 Relief Packages for laid off workers, State-owned Enterprises and the Private Sector, together with a food buffer. At the same time, we increase senior citizens\u2019 support, copra price and general unemployment benefits.\nAs part of our policy for the next four years, my Government will be providing social welfare to certain age groups which are deemed to be the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our efforts to improve the social and economic wellbeing of our citizens.\nAs my government undertakes its task for our people, we implore the United Nations to also do its part. Alleviating poverty is a complex undertaking and a challenging feat, which is duly recognized in the 17 goals of our 2030 Agenda. However, in times like this, we need accelerated action, and coordinated efforts, to target assistance to our most disadvantaged groups, marginalized communities and the least developed amongst us; as they remain most vulnerable, especially during global pandemics.\nThis is the future we want. A future in which development is inclusive and measured by the percentage of the population lifted-up across the poverty line, to live secure and healthier lives. And congruent with the ever-powerful motto of our 2030 agenda- a future that leaves no one behind.\nAccordingly, I believe that the real and true test of the success of multilateralism, and that of our United Nations family, lie not in the measure of the number of treaties concluded or resolutions adopted, nor number of countries that graduate from the list of least developed countries; but rather on how the most vulnerable, disadvantaged, and least developed peoples, can get targeted support to ensure they are less compromised during the onset of global pandemics such as COVID-19. We need a United Nations that embraces these challenges.\nMr. President,\nBlessed with a large ocean, Kiribati depends on the sea for livelihood. A common trait we share with our Blue Pacific family. For us, the sea is our identity and how we define ourselves and how we trace our roots, cultures and traditions. It is also the cornerstone of our economies.\nWe have a large EEZ and hence depend on fishing as our primary source of income, accounting for more than 70 per cent of total annual revenue. Being a volatile resource, we need to affirm our strategic intent of reinvesting more to maximize revenue to buffer the uncertainty posed by COVID-19\nCOVID-19 has created an unprecedented situation worldwide resulting in the closure of borders, both airports and seaports. This has presented a complicated situation for maritime transport and commercial activity, particularly for seafarers. Closure of borders have rendered ships unable to change crews forcing seafarers to stay on-board for extended periods of time and thus subjecting them to various health issues.\nWith current border restrictions around the world, our seafarers are effectively stranded both on land and at sea, unable to embark on ships to work and unable to disembark at other ports. In our efforts to address this issue, on 26 August 2020, my Government declared seafarers as key workers in response to the calls made by the IMO and the UN Secretary-General.\nTo this effect, I wish to make a call for the support of UN family and partners for assistance in fulfilling our commitment for the safety of all seafarers around the world, and their families and economies who depend on them.\nA future that is resilient to the impacts of Climate Change\nMr. President,\nOf great importance to Kiribati and our Blue Pacific is without question, the alarming dilemma of our present time, climate change. To this end, my Government continues to implement critical projects to build resilience, including the Peacebuilding Fund\u2019 climate security project, which I launched in Kiribati earlier this month. In solidarity with our Pacific Islands Forum family, we also remain committed to securing our maritime boundaries, amid the impacts of climate change. This is a matter of sovereignty.\nEqually, we underscore the importance of countries managing their own upper airspace, in line with the requirements of ICAO, relating to effective administration, capacity and safety. My government is committed to invest into our aviation capability and strengthen internet connectivity through fibre optic cable technology and welcome any support from our development partners and the UN family.\nWhile COVID-19 is our immediate crisis, we must continue to work on the other challenges that confront us all, in particular climate change, which presents the single greatest threat to the livelihood, security and wellbeing of the Pacific and its peoples, as declared by Forum Leaders in the Kainaki II Declaration in 2019 and the Boe Declaration in 2018.\nConclusion\nMr. President\nWhen I am asked to define the future that my people want, it remains for me to convey that Kiribati wants an uncompromised future. A future that is secure and certain. A future that seeks to make our planet earth, a resilient, healthier, and safer home. A future in which national plans such as the KiribatiVision for 20 Years (KV20), are enhanced by multilateral policies such as the 2030 Agenda. A future where our United Nations family continue to deliver and coordinate assistance and support, in particular to our most vulnerable communities and the least developed amongst us, in a coordinated and timely manner. A future in which development is inclusive and measured by the percentage of the population lifted up across the poverty line, to live secure and healthier lives; congruent with the ever-powerful motto of our 2030 agenda, to leave no one behind.\nMr. President,\nThe future may be a vision, but it is a vision I believe can come true. And by seeing all the support that Kiribati has received from our UN family in these challenging times, I remain optimistic of this vision.\nMr. President,\nI believe that the transformation called for in our theme is a call for more action and less words. If every nation, acts accordingly along this path of alignment, with the right heart and soul, then there is a good chance of the whole world moving forward towards inclusive social development, for all by the end of 2030.\nI conclude, by sharing with us all our traditional blessings: Te Mauri, Te Raoi ao Te Tabomoa, meaning Health, Peace, and Prosperity.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "Mr President,\nMr Secretary-General,\nDistinguished Delegates,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n75 years ago, from the ashes of a global conflict that devastated nations and peoples, the birth of the Organization of the United Nations marked a new beginning for world history, founded on the shared values of freedom, peace and democracy.\nToday we are faced with an equally dramatic reality, albeit caused by different, unprecedented evils. An invisible enemy has upended our lives and consolidated habits. It has caused victims and suffocated the world economy, forcing us to suspend our social relations and limit our freedoms.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has indiscriminately plagued every region and people of the world, putting humanity, once again, to the test. This tragedy has changed us, but has also offered us the opportunity for a \u201cnew beginning\u201d \u2014 that is up to us to seize: after these months of suffering, we look each other in the eye differently, calling on a new sense of reciprocity and renewed spirit of solidarity.\nItaly was the first Country in Europe and in the West to have faced the emergency on a large-scale. Our Country has become the symbol of a collective effort \u2014 a human effort, before being a health or political one, later serving to benefit the entire international community.\nIn the most traumatic weeks of the emergency, Italy was able to see first-hand the support and friendship of the world community. Many were the demonstrations of solidarity and assistance and many, I wish to underscore, were the testaments to the strength, resilience and courage of my fellow citizens to whom, even in this General Assembly, I feel a duty to say \u201cthank you\u201d for the extraordinary responsibility you have shown.\nOur Country has overcome, with determination, the most acute phase of the health emergency, building on the experience gained directly on the ground, on the front line, in hospital corridors and research laboratories. Efforts that we today wish to share in a reinvigorated multilateral system, with the United Nations at its core, to turn into reality the idea of a world fit to tackle the challenges posed by the pandemic.\nFrom the very start, we proposed the constitution of an international alliance in the fight against COVID-19. This initiative has enabled us to mobilize, in record timing, more than \u20ac40 billion as the global response of the European Union to the crisis, in particular, to guarantee equal and universal access to a vaccine, diagnostics and therapeutics. Italy considers these to be global public goods, with the objective of leaving no one behind. We have endeavored in all of the main international fora and settings of world governance for a multilateral response in both the health and economic sectors, in the form of extraordinary measures.\nThe lesson that our national community has learned from this difficult experience is in all of its complexity \u2014 one very simple thing: that health is a common, inalienable good, and as such, it must be guaranteed for every woman and every man on the Planet.\nToday I am proud not only that Italy, with its scientists, researchers and businesses, has taken on the mantle of some of the most advanced projects on vaccine research. I am particularly proud to say that our contribution and research will be a collective heritage \u2014 the vaccine will be made available to all peoples. We cannot afford to look to the future of our Planet and of our children with selfishness, ignoring the fact that healthcare risks becoming a luxury in too many parts of the world.\nThe hope of soon beating this pandemic should not coincide with the wish to return to our old notion of \u201cnormal\u201d. We should want more, imagine and reinvent a different world \u2014 because our previous reality was not the best possible one; it was perfectible. The challenge for each and every one of us is to improve who we are: it is the life lesson that the pandemic has written on our agendas. Ignoring it, while turning the page without confronting it, would be an unforgiveable mistake.\nThe European Union understood the scope of the challenge: to rethink our world, make it more sustainable, greener, more digital, more inclusive. The \u201cNext EU\nGeneration\u201d, together with the measures of the European Central Bank, represents a historic opportunity to look to Europe as an indispensable guidepost of our global partnership for a new future.\nLast week\u2019s announcement by the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, of a \u201cGlobal Health Summit\u201d to be held in Italy in 2021 \u2014 precisely during Italy\u2019s G20 Presidency \u2014 is a testament to our determined commitment to deliver.\nIt will be a time for coordination but also a tangible demonstration of renewed multilateral cohesion, based on the pursuit of collective well-being. A decisive step toward the crucial role of international cooperation, in which we place our strongest hopes.\nIt is in this spirit that Italy now advances an approach inspired by the \u201cethics of vulnerability\u201d, which calls on all members of the international community to assume their share of collective responsibility for \u201cglobal public goods\u201d, such as fundamental human rights, health, education, sustainability, social and institutional resilience.\nMr President,\nWe are well aware of the responsibility that, with the G20 Presidency, our Country will be vested with to lead global efforts. We especially cannot ignore the particular moment in history our global community is living, to which our work in this august Assembly will be added.\nWe firmly believe that the upcoming G20 in Italy can be an opportunity for a collective renewal, a time to solidify that sense of community that every nation nourished in the darkest hours of the pandemic. We can leverage the synergy and brother- and sisterhood necessary to transform the tragedy of what happened into an opportunity for rebirth and regeneration. We can imagine, together, a New Humanism that puts people front and center.\nItaly\u2019s agenda will focus on: People, Planet and Prosperity. We call them the three Ps. We wish to seize opportunities for change by fighting injustice and inequity, because a more equitable and inclusive society is not only more just; it is also more prosperous and, globally, more democratic.\nParticular attention will be given to the \u201cempowerment\u201d of women, on small and medium enterprises, on precarious workers. Access to digital technology, which for too long has been a source of inequity, should become a driver for inclusive growth, offering opportunities to all.\nThese efforts fall within the two pillars of Agenda 2030 and the Paris Agreement. We will be promoting sustainable, inclusive and resilient growth. The pandemic has opened new horizons for strategies to fight climate change and for environmental protection.\nWe will need to work together so that our renewed ambitions regarding climate change are not disconnected from the promotion of investments and policies for socioeconomic recovery. The European \u201cGreen Deal\u201d is now more than ever necessary to win this challenge of the green transition.\nSafeguarding biodiversity, protecting the oceans, and reversing soil erosion represent essential variables in combating climate change. For this reason, they must all come together as part of the same, shared narrative. The momentous appointments of the \u201cHigh-level Event on Climate Action\u201d and the \u201cSummit on Biodiversity\u201d, will see us hard at work, at the sidelines of this Ministerial Week, to ensure a sustainable recovery.\nOur partnership with the United Kingdom in organizing the 26th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change will reaffirm Italy\u2019s role in this sphere. We will be particularly focused on increasing youth involvement in the debate on fighting climate change: the building of their world, the world of tomorrow, begins today. For this reason, we will be organizing \u2014 in the framework of the CoP26 \u2014 next year\u2019s \u201cYouth4 Climate\u201d in Italy.\nWe wish to give a voice to youths and their proposals, understand their needs, build on the call that echoed in the past year throughout city squares across the globe. It is not simply about inclusivity and intergenerational justice \u2014 principles, which are, among others, enshrined in the Paris Agreement. For us, it is a moral imperative. In this spirit, Italy supports its Partner Countries, and in particular, those that need it the most, in building together a future resilient to climate change and efficient in its use of resources.\nThe society we want to rebuild in the aftermath of the pandemic must prioritize the promotion and protection of human dignity, in all of its forms, without distinction, without exclusion. To this end, Italy will continue to place at the center of its foreign policy action the protection of inalienable human rights in every international forum, starting with the mandate it is currently fulfilling \u2014 as tangible proof of our active commitment \u2014 in the Human Rights Council.\nOur distinctive initiatives in this field are traditionally directed toward abolishing capital punishment. This year, an eighth resolution for a universal moratorium against the death penalty will be submitted to the General Assembly. I recall that the death penalty was abolished for the first time in world history in 1786, by the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. This sensitivity is part of our historic tradition. Indeed the first draft resolution for a universal moratorium was put forward precisely by Italy in 2007. This battle \u2014 I was saying \u2014 is our cultural heritage and national civic identity. It is our hope that the resolution rally an ever-greater consensus.\nHowever, we will not be able to pursue the goal of a society founded on the respect of human rights if we do not prioritize the rights of women. The health crisis has shed an even brighter light on the vulnerability, discrimination, abuse and violence, which women still today endure throughout the world. By the same token, however, the crisis and emergency have also shined a light on their strength and their invaluable, irreplaceable role. This year we are celebrating an important anniversary: 25 years have passed since the fourth Beijing World Conference. This should be an opportunity to take stock of the successes, but also to forge ahead with more work that must be done to hold true to our shared commitments to realizing full, effective gender equality.\nMr President,\nIn many parts of the world, the pandemic has descended upon situations of conflict and severe crises, with potentially devastating consequences. This is why we have immediately supported the Appeal, launched by\nSecretary-General Guterres in March for a \u201cGlobal Ceasefire\u201d.\nItaly firmly believes that matters of peace and security should be tackled by way of prevention, mediation and consolidation of peace. Situations of conflict require a multi-dimensional approach comprising development, politics, culture, justice and human rights. We must give back primacy to politics, politics with a capital P, diplomacy, dialogue and \u2014 allow me to underscore, compelled by my legal background \u2014 international law over military options. We should do so not only to fulfill our natural aspirations toward peace, but because history \u2014 the most recent even more so than earlier chapters \u2014 shows that the recourse to arms is not sustainable nor lasting.\nWe thus stand without fail beside the United Nations in the promotion of stabilization processes, by investing all of our political capital, as well as by making a determined, concrete contribution to the SecretaryGeneral\u2019s peacekeeping initiatives. This action responds to the widespread instability that, unfortunately, continues to afflict the entirety of the Greater Mediterranean, stretching east to Afghanistan and increasingly affecting directly the Sahel and the Horn of Africa in the south. Across this vast and complex region, Italy will continue to make a proactive and multidimensional contribution to peace, security and development.\nToday we can look with hope to the timid but encouraging developments in the peace process in Libya. Its chances of success are tied to two factors: the respect of the Libyan people\u2019s ownership of an inclusive solution and the essential mediation role of the UN. We must stop external interferences and meddling.\nThe ceasefire, despite its fragility, has finally reopened a space for intra- Libyan dialogue and the recent talks in Montreux send a strong signal that we must heed and protect. There is no better way to sustain peace than to show its advantages to the very peoples touched by the conflict. For this reason, the next step to take in Libya will be to allow for a resumption of oil production, throughout the Country, promoting an equitable management of resources to the benefit of the entire, and I mean entire, Libyan population.\nThe humanitarian initiatives that, through the invaluable work of UN agencies and Italy\u2019s strong support, touch every part of the Country, must continue to be supported as they complement the path toward a political solution \u2014 the only solution that can guarantee lasting peace and stability for Libya.\nJust over two weeks ago, I visited Lebanon, to personally bear testament to Italy\u2019s solidarity to a people that \u2014 in the midst of a severe economic, political and health crisis \u2014 found itself grappling with the horrible tragedy that struck Beirut on 4 August. I also wished to encourage its institutions to continue to take heed of the Lebanese people\u2019s demand for reforms that can no longer wait.\nItaly immediately took to the front line in the collective effort, led by the United Nations, to overcome the current emergency and support future reconstruction. Italy will continue to do so, contributing to the stabilization efforts conducted by the UNIFIL mission currently under Italian command.\nAmong the negative effects the pandemic has caused in crisis areas is the worsening of the already dire vulnerabilities of migrants. Irregular migration flows are a global challenge, and as such, can be overcome only through a multilateral response of the international community. What is needed is action structured around the principles of solidarity and accountability, and founded on partnerships with the Countries of origin, transit and destination of flows.\nWe thus need collective action against the networks of traffickers of human beings. At the same time, we must nurture a long-term vision that starts with tracing back to the root causes of these movements. Italy, as a Country of entry into the European Union, is once again on the front line to support a change in perspective leading to a multilevel European governance based on genuine solidarity, and the development of secure channels for legal migration. Mr President,\nWe must ensure that the Organization fulfill its mandate in the best way possible, realizing the founding principles of its Charter, which are still today a vital point of reference for the international community, by rallying our efforts around the process of reform of the United Nations Security Council. We must make this process more democratic, more effective and more representative of the entire UN Membership.\nThe invisible enemy of today has yet to be defeated and is still causing victims and uncertainties. The pandemic has cast a light on our weaknesses, but also on our strength as an international community.\nIt has taught us that only together can we turn this dark page. It is, once again, time to embark on a new journey. It is time for courage; time for vision, as it was 75 years ago. Let us all, therefore, renew our commitment to work together to build the future of our children.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "His Excellency Antonio Guterres, Secretary General of the United Nations.\nHis Excellency Volkan Bozkir, President of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly\nYour Excellencies Heads of State and Government\nDistinguished Delegates\nLadies and Gentlemen.\nThere is no memory since the Organization\u2019s establishment of a situation in which the Heads of State and/or Government of the UN Member States, for reasons beyond their schedule, could not personally attend the General Assembly of the organization, which discusses the great topics about international relations and seeks to outline solutions aimed to resolve the main concerns of the mankind by ensuring peace, security and stability of our continent \u2014 our common home.\nToday, despite the current circumstances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, which imposes on all of us restrictions in movements and all other procedures that are appropriate for this juncture, it has been possible to communicate amongst ourselves with a virtual feeling of being together thanks to the almost unlimited possibilities brought about by new technologies to the service of mankind.\nMr. Secretary General, please allow me to congratulate you on having taken the opportune decision to maintain the dynamics of the functioning of the United Nations with the technological resources at our disposal.\nI also would like to highlight the exemplary manner how you have been tackling the problems resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, whose effects and consequences would have taken more dramatic proportions than those we are experiencing now, if the World Health Organization and other specialized agencies of the United Nations system did not act quickly and pass recommendations that have greatly helped control the spread of the disease.\nExcellencies,\nThis pandemic has come to show at global level the weakness of our health structure in responding to a problem of so high magnitude and severity.\nDespite this obvious evidence, through joint efforts, collaboration and cooperation amongst nations and exchanges among specialized scientific institutions we have managed to face the problem that was previously fully unknown, and that has obliged us to seek prompt response in order to alleviate the effects of the disease.\nThis global health problem has paralyzed all momentum that was built for the recovery of the world economy, which after the economic crisis that started in 2008, was already sending out encouraging signals for recovery and very specially in the developing countries, such as the case of Angola.\nOur hopes of starting to yield positive results following our endeavour for domestic economy reform, conducted in a context where we had to apply harsh measures, with very tough impact on the lives of people, will not come true soon due to the current constraints that have disrupted the production chain, affecting the prices of the main export commodities, and paralysed services and other vital sectors of the economy, giving rise to very high unemployment rates and an alarming social situation.\nOne should single out that the resources we had for the financing of the productive sectors for its recovery had to be diverted, given the current context, to serve the needs of biosafety and other necessities of urgent epidemiological nature brought about by the pandemic.\nIn this regard, we were obliged to rapidly build throughout the national territory centres to host people under the situation of official quarantine, to equip the country\u2019s hospitals with basic equipment for COVID-19-related medical emergencies and so on, to build hospital centres with capacity to treat possible outbreak of the pandemic and other related facilities.\nI should acknowledge that apart from our own efforts, we have also benefited the solidarity of other countries, international organization, companies, and local and international nongovernment organizations as well as individual citizens who have helped mitigate somehow the pandemic impact in Angola, to whom we would like to thank.\nExcellencies,\nThis human virtue that has always been useful at so critical moments such as the one that we are going through, helps immensely but it is not always enough to solve at grassroot the problems we are to face as a consequence of the very complex situations such as the one we are currently experiencing.\nI therefore would like to express my appreciation for the G-20 initiative which has demonstrated the great sensitivity to the need for a collective action with a view relieving the debt of the developing countries as means to cushion the burden or liability that fall upon this group of countries.\nWe think that it is fundamental to view direct investment in the economies of developing countries as a great equation for their economic growth and development.\nThis goal may be achieved if developed countries mobilize themselves to establish funds for investments aid in Africa to be used by those investors interested in doing business in the African continent, where they may produce goods and services for local consumption and export.\nExcellencies,\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has come to prove that when we act in coordination, responsibility is shared in a more efficient manner and thus more satisfactory results are achieved.\nThis vision supports the idea that multilateralism should always be present in any approach to be taken regarding the most pressing international issues facing the world.\nFor this reason, along its journey the United Nations has always advocated for multilateralism in resolving the intricate problems of Humanity.\nThus, we think within this spirit we should focus our endeavours in the search for fair and long lasting solutions to the problems of the Middle East, that have to do with Security Council pertinent resolutions on the matter, as well as those that are afflicting the African continent, where conflicts and instability still prevail, such as the case of Libya, the Sahel Region and others conflicts of minor scale in other regions of the continent.\nIt is worth to recognize that the nature of security problems in Africa, in many cases, is associated with the phenomenon of international terrorism, expansion of religious fundamentalism and post-election conflicts that require redoubled surveillance and attention by the United Nations, without forgetting the support to be rendered to those countries faced with these circumstances.\nIn light of the aforegoing, the United Nations should seek to interpret with impartiality the underlying factors of the domestic political tensions arising from election processes and assume a position that does not ignore the legitimately established Government, while strengthening their capacity to intervene in resolving the problems to ensure the normal functioning of institutions.\nExcellencies,\nThe United Nations, within the current world context, which portrays a reality totally different from the one that was on the basis of its establishment, should seek to reflect within its internal structures the characteristics of the geopolitical reality of nowadays in order to render it into an organization that is able to safeguard the balance of global interests.\nIn this regard, we once more reiterate the urgent need for reform of the organization so as to achieve a UN Security Council that attends better to representation of the peoples, nations and continents.\nExcellencies,\nI thank you for your attention and wish that this 75th Session of the United Nations may attain its goals.\nThank you very much"

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nAt the outset, I would like to thank His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad- Bande for his distinguished leadership of the previous session, and we look forward to working with the Office of the President of the General Assembly of this session.\nCoinciding with the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, the world is witnessing a critical turning point following the spread of the Coronavirus. While we celebrate the achievements that we have made since the foundation of the United Nations, we must reflect on the nature of the challenges we face. Today, some conflicts are becoming dangerously regionalized. There is also the growing influence of extremist groups. Threats of cyberwar are rising and the use of sophisticated weapons to attack strategic areas is increasing.\nDespite these mounting global threats, the UAE believes that we can transform unprecedented challenges into great opportunities by uniting our efforts and building international institutions capable of coping with current and emerging challenges. These past months have proven that confronting international threats requires taking collective action and wise leadership to forge a coordinated international response to address the implications of these threats.\nOne starting point should be continuing to focus on solving existing political crises and preventing new conflicts from emerging, especially during the spread of the pandemic. My country will continue to work with regional and international partners to restore security and stability while ensuring that affected countries take the lead in developing solutions that meet the legitimate aspirations of their peoples.\nMr. President,\nSolving crises, especially in our Arab region, requires taking a unified international position. A position that rejects the violation of the sovereignty of states and interference in their internal affairs. A position that seeks UN led political solutions and addresses threats posed by terrorist groups such as the Houthis, Da\u2019esh, al-Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood. In this context, the United Arab Emirates reiterates its support for the Secretary-General\u2019s appeal for a global ceasefire.\nIn this context, we must stress the importance of upholding the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations that continue to be the core of the UAE\u2019s foreign policy, particularly in our pursuit of restoring stability in our region. We have repeatedly warned against the expansionist ambitions of some states in the region, and we have consistently called upon the international community to end the interference in the internal affairs of states and to hold accountable those who finance it.\nThese warnings stemmed from our reality and experience. The tensions in Yemen, Syria, Libya, Iraq and other states are all related to blatant interference in Arab affairs made by states that incite strife and discord, or that have historical delusions of restoring their domination and colonial rule over the Arab region and the Horn of Africa. The result has been brutal wars. In this context, we recall our firm position of rejecting regional interference in Arab affairs, and request full respect for sovereignty, which is fully consistent with international law and international norms.\nAlthough illegal interference has destabilized Yemen\u2019s security for years, we strongly believe that stability in Yemen can be restored, especially within the current environment that could lead to a complete ceasefire and a permanent political solution under the auspices of the United Nations. In this regard, we affirm that the decision to pursue a political process in Yemen is a Yemeni decision. My country also commends the tremendous efforts made by the brotherly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We reiterate the UAE\u2019s support for the Riyadh Agreement and our call for a united Yemeni position in order to reach a sustainable solution.\nIn a similar context, my country expresses its deep concern regarding Turkey\u2019s military interference in Libya, which is an alarming part of the regional interference in Arab affairs that has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis, undermined efforts to reach a peaceful solution, and destabilized the entire region. Therefore, my country supports the repeated calls for an immediate ceasefire in Libya and calls upon all parties to commit to a political process under the auspices of the United Nations and to build on the outcomes of the Berlin Conference. Since the outbreak of the conflict in Libya, my country has called for a peaceful political solution to the crisis in order to achieve lasting security and stability.\nLikewise, my country calls for stopping all foreign interference in Syrian affairs and warns of the serious implications for Syria\u2019s unity and for Arab security. We also reiterate that a political process is the only way to end the Syrian crisis and protect the security of its people.\nWe also express our concern regarding the vulnerability of conflict areas to the Coronavirus pandemic, as these areas are the least prepared to address this danger.\nMr. President,\nMaintaining the progress achieved against Da\u2019esh in Syria and Iraq requires continuing the efforts to rebuild liberated areas, strengthen the rule of law in these areas, and protect communities against extremism and terrorism. Support and economic assistance should also be provided to Sudan. It is also important to prevent any interference in Sudan\u2019s internal affairs and to stop extremist groups from exploiting the situation and threaten the security of the Sudan and its neighboring states.\nThe call for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on the borders of 1967 with East Jerusalem as its capital in line with the relevant international resolutions and the Arab and international consensus will remain a firm demand. My country has made persistent efforts using all available diplomatic channels to affirm our total rejection of the annexation of Palestinian territory, and we have warned of its impact on all parties and on the security of the region.\nWith the signing of a historic peace accord with Israel, supported by American efforts, my country was able to freeze the annexation decision and opened broad prospects to achieve a comprehensive peace in the region. We hope this peace accord will provide the opportunity for the Palestinians and the Israelis to re-engage in negotiations to achieve peace. Our position towards supporting the Palestinian people and achieving the two-state solution is firm.\nWe will work to ensure that the peace accord will open new intellectual horizons in the region and create a prosperous path for future generations who deserve a stable region and a better reality than wars and poverty.\nMy country will also continue to call for peaceful settlement of disputes. In this context, we reiterate the UAE\u2019s firm position and its legitimate right of sovereignty over its three islands: Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb, and Abu Musa, which are occupied by Iran in flagrant violation of international law and the UN Charter, and in total disregard of all historical records that clearly affirm the UAE\u2019s ownership of these islands and that these islands have been under Arab rule since ancient times. Therefore, the UAE will not give up its demand that Iran return these islands to their rightful owners. My country has called on Iran to peacefully resolve this issue through direct negotiations, or through the International Court of Justice. However, Iran has not answered these calls.\nWe look forward to seeing Iran respect the principles of good-neighborliness and abide by Security Council resolutions by stopping the development of its ballistic missile programs and ceasing the arming of terrorist groups. In this context, my country is particularly concerned that the restrictions imposed on Iran under the nuclear agreement are soon due to expire. Since the nuclear agreement did not achieve its desired outcome, we hope that this experience will be useful in achieving a more comprehensive agreement that addresses the concerns of states in the region and that makes them key partners in drafting the terms of the agreement.\nMr. President,\nWe must continue focusing on coordinating our action to provide humanitarian and economic assistance to the states affected by conflicts or by other issues such as climate change and the pandemic. My country has been at the forefront of the countries responding to the impacts of the pandemic by providing assistance, supporting international institutions, and sending aid to communities around the world. During these critical times, states must set their differences aside and focus on strengthening their cooperation to develop and provide access to vaccines and treatment for all peoples. We also encourage starting planning now for the recovery phase and for revitalizing the global economy. We must ensure that supply chains will not be interrupted, as they are a key element in achieving global food security.\nMr. President,\nMy country adopted an effective, scientific program to contain the Novel Coronavirus Pandemic. We have committed to applying strict preventive measures to stop the spread of the virus, we have conducted the largest possible number of tests, and we have shared the results with our partners. The advanced digital infrastructure in the UAE facilitated the resumption of work and remote study to maintain the safety of our people. In addition to providing a local economic aid package, we were able to strengthen the capacity of our health system, support international research on the pandemic, and prepare for potential future pandemics.\nFuture preparedness is not new to my country, which has followed this approach since its establishment. Today, we look forward to the fiftieth anniversary of our union with confidence and optimism. Our efforts have culminated in the creation of a sustainable economy and other significant achievements, including the launching of a probe to Mars this year. The UAE will continue to encourage innovation, technology, and bridging knowledge gaps between peoples. The UAE will also continue to advocate the empowerment of youth and women and providing them with equal opportunities. Additionally, we need to continue building peaceful and secure communities by strengthening coexistence and dialogue among religions and cultures.\nSince its establishment, my country has been committed to international law, the UN Charter, and UN resolutions. In addressing the serious challenges in our region, my country has further embraced multilateralism as a tool to reduce escalation, resolve crises, and develop lasting and comprehensive political solutions. In this context, we are pleased to announce our candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the period 2022-2023. My country will follow the same steps and principles upon which it was founded to maintain international peace and security in cooperation with the members of the Council.\nWe recognize the significant responsibility associated with membership on the Security Council and the extensive challenges the Council faces, and we affirm that the UAE will work towards solving the important issues confronting states with resolve and determination. In doing so, we will be guided by our understanding of these crises, our experiences in the Arab region, and our close relationships with Member States. My country will continue its call for involving regional organizations in finding permanent solutions for crises, and we count on your support to achieve these goals.\nWe look forward to continuing work with all partners to achieve our shared vision of creating a peaceful and prosperous world \u2014 a world capable of meeting these challenges.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President;\nLadies and gentlemen Heads of State and delegations;\nMr. Secretary-General of the United Nations;\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nThe Field Marshal of Chad, Mr. Idriss Deby Into, President of the Republic, Head of State, who would have liked to address this august Assembly personally but was unable to do so, has instructed me to deliver the following message to you.\n\u201cI would like first of all to congratulate the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fifth session, His Excellency Ambassador Volkan Bozkir, whose election comes during this particularly difficult time of the COVID-19 pandemic, and assure him of my country\u2019s full support in carrying out his mandate.\n\u201cAt the same time, I would like to express my sincere thanks to His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, the outgoing President, who was able to carry out his mission successfully despite the unexpected outbreak of the pandemic, which must have impacted on his work agenda.\n\u201cAllow me to pay a glowing tribute to His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, for his wise leadership and management of the crisis throughout this challenging period.\n\u201cI would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Director- General of the World Health Organization, His Excellency Mr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and all his collaborators, for the remarkable work they are doing to fight this pandemic on a daily basis. The lessons learned from this pandemic provide us with an opportunity to rethink our health systems. Therefore, the WHO must adapt in terms of how to prevent and combat the occurrence of such pandemics in the future.\n\u201cI would like to acknowledge the leadership of His Excellency Mr. Matamela Cyril Ramaphosa, President of the Republic of South Africa and the Chairperson of the African Union, as well as the African Union Commission. They have been able to put a continental strategy in place to respond to the pandemic by taking timely measures aimed at pooling medical supplies for Member States, safeguarding the African economy and researching the vaccine against COVID-19, inter alia.\n\u201cExcellencies;\n\u201cLadies and Gentlemen,\n\u201cThe revised format of this year\u2019s general debate is a perfect illustration, if any were needed, of the scale of the upheaval in the world caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which unfortunately continues to rage. This invisible and relentless enemy has not only caused enormous human damage, but has also had a profound impact on all aspects of economic and social life, putting our national and global response capacities to the test.\n\u201cThe highly relevant theme of this session, \u2018The future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism \u2014 confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action\u2019, fully underlines the importance that we must all attach to international cooperation and multilateralism as an irreplaceable means to address major common challenges such as pandemics, climate change, terrorism, poverty and inequality, to name but a few.\n\u201cThe COVID-19 crisis has laid bare our common weaknesses and, at the same time, demonstrated the need for enhanced collective efforts to better understand and overcome global challenges for the benefit of each and every one of us. This is an opportunity for this great family of nations, at this celebration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of our Organization and in the current particular context, to reaffirm the central place of the United Nations and the primordial role of multilateralism in international relations.\n\u201cIt is also the occasion to underline the absolute urgency of strengthening multilateralism through the reform of global governance, which has been severely tested during this period, with a view to adapting it to today\u2019s world in order to better face up to and resolve current and future challenges.\n\u201cChad emphasizes the imperative need for increased international cooperation through meaningful solidarity with the most vulnerable countries, the least-developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States so that the promises of the Charter of the United Nations are fully realized and that the ultimate goal of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to leave no one behind becomes a reality \u2014 not just another broken promise.\n\u201cExcellencies;\n\u201cLadies and Gentlemen,\n\u201cThe whole world is currently experiencing the devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the ability to deal with it varies by country. Developing countries, particularly African ones, owing to their multiple structural weaknesses, are more exposed to the adverse consequences of the scourge.\n\u201cAs a landlocked Sahelian country, which is already confronting a number of crises, Chad is suffering full-on the many repercussions of the pandemic at the various levels of national life. Attending to the country\u2019s national priorities has been upended, and the State\u2019s limited resources have had to be redirected to deal first and foremost with health, humanitarian and socioeconomic emergencies.\n\u201cAs in other countries in the same situation, the socioeconomic situation in Chad is of concern. Growth for the current year has been revised to be negative; the budget deficit has increased; several hundred thousand workers have become officially unemployed; household life has been significantly affected; and the macroeconomic data for 2021 are not looking good. The Government\u2019s ability to implement the development activities emanating from the national development plan of Chad for the period from 2017 to 2021, as the main lever for implementing international agendas, in particular the first 10-year implementation plan of Agenda 2063 of the African Union and the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, has been eroded.\n\u201cChad\u2019s national development plan, which was firmly supported by donors at the round table held in Paris in 2017, has not seen the expected results owing to the low level of anticipated resources. Therefore, in order to support the Government in its efforts to promote sustainable development, honouring the pledges to finance that effort is crucial for Chad, which is currently preparing its second national development plan.\n\u201cExcellencies,\n\u201cLadies and Gentlemen,\nIt is worth recalling that, last year, at the General Assembly during its seventy-fourth session, we assessed the progress made and the enormous gaps that remained relative to fulfilling the commitments we made within the framework of the 2030 Agenda in terms of ending extreme poverty, ensuring access to quality education, combating climate change, reducing inequalities and ensuring inclusion.\n\u201cIn particular, in Africa the gap in financing sustainable development is enormous. The promises made in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda have not been fulfilled.\n\u201cThis is the moment to underscore that, without robust action taken by all stakeholders, it is highly likely that our shared goal of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda will not be met. That is why the Decade of Action is key to translating words into action to marshal the resources needed and ramp up the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.\n\u201cThe international community, in particular the UN, must increase momentum and double efforts to ensure that development on the African continent, where the greatest number of least developed countries are located, is placed at the centre of international priorities through concrete actions reflecting that commitment. Only the increased involvement of the UN, whose leadership is more crucial than ever and the renewed commitment of all stakeholders will make it possible to provide the decisive impetus required to mobilize the resources needed to achieve the promises of the 2030 Agenda and support those countries already on the path to achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\u201cIn that regard, it is fitting to recall that debt was already a major handicap that the pandemic has accentuated. As the African Development Bank has noted, nearly 50 million additional people could be at risk of falling into extreme poverty in Africa in 2020. Moreover, Africa\u2019s losses resulting from the pandemic will reach several hundred billion dollars for the period from 2020 to 2021. Many countries could then be forced to borrow, further aggravating the debt burden.\n\u201cIn view of the magnitude of the challenges to be met and the present and future multisectoral needs, Chad once again calls for the outright cancellation of the external debt of African countries so that they can successfully respond to the COVID-19 crisis and adequately commit to addressing the post- COVID-19 socioeconomic reconstruction on a firmer foundation.\n\u201cExcellencies,\n\u201cLadies and Gentlemen,\n\u201cAt the same time that the world is facing the coronavirus, terrorism continues to rage on the ground in Africa, particularly in the Lake Chad Basin and the Sahelo-Saharan region, while claiming innocent victims on a daily basis and seriously compromising the development efforts of countries in the region.\n\u201cSuch was the case with the deadly 23 March attack perpetrated by Boko Haram against the Chadian defence and security forces in Boma in the Lac province. A vigorous response was launched by our forces, which led to clearing the islands of Lake Chad of Boko Haram terrorist elements.\n\u201cBut we are under no illusions. The terrorist threat will not disappear overnight. We will continue to remain vigilant and engaged until security is finally restored in the affected areas through the eradication of the terrorist threat.\n\u201cIn this context, we emphasize once again that the responsibility to combat terrorism in the Sahel and the Lake Chad regions is also international, as our struggle is part of the global efforts to ensure international peace and security.\n\u201cWe therefore call once again on the international community for greater and sustained support for the Multinational Joint Task Force in the Lake Chad Basin and the G-5 Sahel joint force established by the countries of the region to combat Boko Haram and jihadist groups in the Sahel.\n\u201cIf the situation in the Sahel is not improving despite the many initiatives and commitments by partners, it is because the fault lies primarily with the failure to fulfil promises made in support of G-5 Sahel joint force and the G-5 Sahel Priority Investment Programme.\n\u201cThat is compounded by the low level of synergy among the various initiatives and forces present in the Sahel. We therefore believe that it is time to translate words into actions in the Sahel by honouring pledged contributions and marshalling additional resources to make the G-5 joint force fully operational and implement the development projects of the G-5 Sahel Priority Investment Programme.\n\u201cOur States have made considerable efforts of their own despite their modest resources. We have certainly benefited from the multifaceted support of bilateral and multilateral partners to whom we once again express our sincere gratitude. But given the magnitude of the challenges, continued and reliable international support is crucial.\n\u201cWe take this opportunity to call once again on the Security Council to place the G-5 Sahel joint force under Chapter VII of the UN Charter in order to ensure its sustainable and predictable financing.\n\u201cFurthermore, we welcome the launch of the Coalition for the Sahel, based on the agreement among the G-5 Sahel countries and their partners to pool efforts and resources to combat terrorism.\n\u201cIn that regard, it is important to continue working on strengthening the coherence of the goals and activities of all initiatives in support of the G-5 Sahel in order to respond more effectively to challenges and produce tangible results on the ground in terms of security and development.\n\u201cExcellencies,\n\u201cLadies and Gentlemen,\n\u201cConcerning the issue of climate change, Chad \u2014 a Sahelian country subject to the harmful effects of this existential threat, which strongly affects the sectors that make up the foundation of its economy \u2014 remains committed to the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\n\u201cIn that light, the urgent need to implement the measures adopted within the framework of financing the fight against climate change, particularly those aimed at marshalling substantial resources for developing countries, is no longer in doubt.\n\u201cExcellencies,\n\u201cLadies and Gentlemen,\n\u201cAt the international level, we welcome the ceasefire in Libya, declared simultaneously by the President of the Presidency Council of the Government of National Accord and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Chad reiterates its call on the Security Council to shoulder all its responsibilities to end external interference. It once again urges all Libyan stakeholders to respect the ceasefire and to resolutely engage in a process of inclusive negotiations leading to true national reconciliation.\n\u201cWith regard to the Sudan, Chad welcomes the signing of a peace agreement among Sudanese parties on 31 August in Juba thanks to the mediation efforts, in which Chad is a stakeholder, under the leadership of President Salva Kiir Mayardit of the Republic of South Sudan, whose personal involvement I commend.\n\u201cChad calls on the other armed movements to join the process in order to achieve a comprehensive and lasting peace, which the Sudanese people greatly need.\n\u201cConcerning the tension surrounding the Great Renaissance Dam in Ethiopia, Chad calls on the brotherly Governments of Egypt, Ethiopia and the Sudan to continue to prioritize dialogue in order to reach a negotiated solution under the aegis of the African Union.\n\u201cWith regard to the situation in Palestine, Chad welcomes the agreement reached between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, which provides, inter alia, for the suspension of the annexation of certain parts of the West Bank.\nIt also welcomes the agreement with the State of Bahrain. Chad reaffirms its commitment to the two-State solution within their pre-June 1967 borders, in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions and the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative.\n\u201cWith regard to the embargo imposed on Cuba, Chad reiterates its call for its definitive lifting.\n\u201cExcellencies,\n\u201cLadies and Gentlemen,\n\u201cThe UN we need must meet the aspirations of all Member States. Africa must have its full place in that decision-making organ of the United Nations. Disputes over UN and Security Council reform seem interminable to us while challenges urgently require our attention.\n\u201cIt is time for justice and equity to be restored for Africa. In that regard, Chad remains committed to the Common African Position articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus.\n\u201cI wish our work every success.\n\u201cThank you for your kind attention.\u201d"

        "file_text": "I\tIntroduction\nMr. President, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,\nI congratulate you, Mr. Bozkir, on assuming the post of President of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly.\nI assure you of Latvia\u2019s cooperation as you guide the work of this essential body in the coming year.\nII\tMultilateral response to Covidl9 pandemic\nMr. President,\nWe meet in virtual form because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused unprecedented global upheaval in our generation.\nWhile each country has taken measures to prevent and control the spread of the pandemic at home, no country can overcome it on its own.\nThe United Nations and its agencies, notably the World Health Organization, are crucial in coordinating and providing a global response. This role should be fulfilled effectively, and lessons must be learned to be better prepared for future challenges.\nLatvia quickly responded to the global appeal of the UN Secretary-General by contributing to the Global Humanitarian Response Plan for COVID-19 through the World Health Organization.\nFurthermore, Latvian scientists participate in the global efforts to develop an effective vaccine against the virus, so that we can return to normality.\nIII\tGlobal security\nMr President,\nEffective multilateralism remains the most essential tool for maintaining the international rules-based order and security.\nThe rules-based order is the foundation for global justice and peace. The main purpose of international law is to ensure respect for fundamental human rights and state sovereignty. The world will see fewer conflicts and threats to peace if people sense they are treated justly. Every state is responsible for respecting this order.\nThe United Nations, too, must make every effort to ensure that this order is respected, both by large and small states \u2014 nowadays not only in the analogue world, but also the virtual world created by modern technologies.\nTherefore, the United Nations should actively use all instruments, including diplomatic efforts and peace-keeping missions, to find just political solutions to today\u2019s complex and protracted conflicts throughout the world.\nConcerning one important aspect of justice, Latvia remains strong in its support of the Women, Peace and Security agenda, in recognition of the close link between global security and equal participation of women.\nThe substantial contribution of smaller countries to international peace and security is currently being demonstrated by our northern neighbour Estonia, as it holds a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Latvia, too, hopes to assume this honour and responsibility for the term 2026-2027.\nIV\tRecovery from the pandemic\nMr President,\nLatvia supports the UN Secretary-General\u2019s call to \u201cbuild back better\u201d from the pandemic. As a member of the UN Economic and Social Affairs Council (ECOSOC) Latvia will continue to advance the \u201crecover better\u201d agenda.\nThe implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement must remain at the centre of our recovery efforts. Faster recovery will require good governance and respect for human rights and gender equality.\nI am convinced that to \u201crecover better\u201d means a green, digital and inclusive recovery. We urgently need to strengthen our efforts to address climate change, to tackle the loss of biodiversity and to protect the environment. We should promote more sustainable consumption and production patterns. Latvia has joined the Group of Friends to combat marine plastic pollution. We stand ready to work together to address this challenge and to share the Baltic Sea region perspective.\nDuring the pandemic Latvia quickly introduced digital solutions and tools in order to continue education and all democratic processes remotely. Latvia was amongst the first countries to develop a national mobile application \u201cStopCovid\u201d, successfully balancing effectiveness of contact tracing with respect for privacy. Latvia was also among the first to introduce e-parliament, where a Parliament can fully function remotely \u2014 propose new legislation, debate and vote on laws - relying on the secure digital identity of every member of Parliament.\nMr President,\n\u201cRecover better\u201d also means that in going digital, we must take even greater care with data collection and use, especially in regard to privacy. When governments, international companies and other entities digitally collect more information about a person than he or she is aware, this creates a considerable threat to personal freedom. It also makes a person much more vulnerable to manipulation.\nTo be more concrete and direct - digital tracing and profiling, which are very difficult to evade, endanger a person\u2019s fundamental freedom. This is a serious challenge for society. By resolving the legal framework and investing in technologies that factor in respect for privacy, I believe we can create human-centred technologies with much bigger potential. We all need to address this challenge together, at the national, regional and global level, with full respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms.\nI want Latvia to be a global role model for a human-centred multilingual digital economy, to support developing economies in going digital, and at the same time to elaborate digital standards for the respect of privacy and to promote them internationally.\nV\tInfodemic\nMr President,\nLatvia is concerned that among other negative consequences, COVID-19 has created a breeding ground for misinformation, disinformation, fake news and hate speech. It is critical that states counter misinformation and provide access to free, reliable and science-based information through free media. This is a universal human right that we must respect and help each other to exercise.\nLatvia has credible expertise and can contribute to this end. In June at the United Nations, Latvia together with a cross-regional group of 130 countries called for action to fight misinformation and disinformation, or the so-called \u201cinfodemic\u201d, in the context of COVID-19.\nThe statement complements the \u201cVerified\u201d campaign announced by the UN Secretary-General, as well as the UNESCO response to this negative trend.\nFree, objective and pluralistic media play an indispensable role in informing the public during the ongoing pandemic.\nTechnology companies and social media platforms need to be more accountable for addressing online disinformation. Social media is not merely a platform where people and diverse information meets. The technology, the algorithms, the business models that drive the advertising market and attention economy all play a large part in the distribution of disinformation. Our priority must be to protect both privacy and freedom of expression in the digital domain.\nThe exponential increase of misinformation, disinformation, fake news and hate speech in recent years is dangerous not only in the context of the pandemic. It is a general threat to world peace, it is a general threat to efforts to solve global issues such as climate change and environmental pollution. In short \u2014 it is a general problem of humankind to find rational solutions to the challenges of our time. These threats should be taken seriously both on the national and international level.\nVI\tDistortion of history\nMr President,\nConcerning the wider phenomenon of disinformation, I would like to address one example. Russia\u2019s increasingly revisionist approach, especially in the context of World War II events, is unacceptable. Russia makes continuous attempts to turn history into a disinformation tool. This goes hand in hand with continuing restrictions on democracy and free speech. We call for an independent, international investigation into the recent poisoning of opposition leader Alexey Navalny. The perpetrators of this crime must be held accountable.\nVII\tBelarus\nWe also follow with great concern the events in Belarus, especially in view of the brutal repressions that followed the presidential elections on 9 August. We call for new, democratic and transparent elections and an end to the repression of peaceful demonstrators. Latvia is currently providing medical treatment to several victims of the repressions. We also call on Russia to desist from any further interference in Belarus, so that its people can decide for themselves the future of their state.\nThe women of Belarus especially have shown great strength and courage. Svetlana Alexievich, laureate of the 2015 Nobel Prize for literature, speaks of \u201cthirst for changes, thirst for new life, thirst for honesty\u201d. In Latvia we still remember such thirst 30 years ago. We are always ready to share our rich experience of regaining democracy and freedom.\nVIII\tConclusion\nMr President,\nI sincerely hope that this time next year we can all meet again in person. Until then, let us use this unusual time wisely. Mobilized by the shared suffering during this pandemic, let us make renewed efforts to forge peace and a sustainable way of life, for the good of all humanity.\nThank you!"

        "file_text": "Mr.\tPresident of the\tUnited Nations General Assembly,\nAmbassador Volkan Bozkir;\nSecretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Antonio Guterres; Excellencies,\nI greet all participants, with the hope that this sui generis meeting will be one more decisive step in the search for a more humane world, with international peace and security, in an environment of fair and balanced relationship between all nations.\nI congratulate you Mr. President, on your election. I wish you success during your term.\nI appreciate Ambassador Tijjani Muhammad-Bande\u2019s successful mandate during these difficult times. My fellow countryman, Emanuel Tilman, had the opportunity to work in your office. The experience he gained working with the President will be precious for his life.\nThe topic chosen by the President is a challenge. For my country, this is a real commitment. On behalf of my People, I thank and pay homage to all who are on the front line and express condolences to those who have lost their loved ones.\nTo the fear and insecurity that have seized people, health systems have been weakened and the socio-economic fabric has been totally shaken, causing the loss of millions of jobs. On March 21, the first positive case was confirmed in my country. Before the first State of Emergency was decreed, our citizens already took action.\nIn preventing and combating COVID-19, the Government worked in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO).\nThe borders were closed, quarantine and isolation units were created, and teams were formed to sensitize our people.\nThe establishment of an Integrated Crisis Management Center allowed a coordinated work between all sectors involved in this fight.\nAlso important was the support of other partners such as China, Australia, Cuba, the United States of America and the European Union, with support in human resources and the donation of equipment, needed for this fight. Timor-Leste has recorded, since March, 27 positive cases, of which 26 have been recovered. To date, no one has gone into intensive care.\nAs President of the Republic, and in strict agreement with the Government, we took advantage of the impact of COVID-19 to establish an Economic Recovery Plan, centered on people, which will reactivate the national economy, with measures in the short, medium and long term. It is a means of stopping the loss of jobs and income.\nWe take it as an opportunity to correct and address structural weaknesses.\nMay the vaccine to be produced become a global public good. Also, in the spirit of collective and solidarity action, the Secretary General, my dear friend Antonio Guterres\u2019s Response Plan to COVID-19, and the various initiatives to alleviate the burden of debt and the financing for development are worth mentioning. I am deeply convinced that together in a genuine spirit of solidarity, the Humankind will overcome this challenge.\nDespite the cruelty, the pandemic has given us the opportunity to be increasingly aware of the importance of the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda.\nGlobal cooperation and partnerships, both at the regional and national levels, are crucial to build a resilient, sustainable and inclusive world.\nIn the spirit that no one will be left behind, we must pay attention to the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and, moreover, to the most vulnerable, fragile countries and to the Small Island Developing States (SIDS). We are a post-conflict country and under the spirit of solidarity, Timor-Leste was the basis for the establishment of a coalition of Fragile States, known as the g7+, whose Secretariat is based in Dili.\nIt is also in the spirit of contributing to peace and stability in the Region, and in the context of the challenges that any State faces and that concerns its insertion in the region in which it finds itself, that my country is committed to the process of joining ASEAN, regional block with more than 600 million inhabitants.\nMr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nThe disrespect for Nature has caused climate changes with negative impact on Humankind. The destruction of ecosystems and biodiversity is linked to the new diseases of which COVID-19 is an illustration.\nThus, Timor-Leste believes that the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Sustainable Development Goals embody essential means and issues on the road to the reconstruction of our countries. The development of family farming, the rational and planned use of natural resources, the fight against pollution and intelligent policies to protect the environment, with the engagement of citizens are crucial issues that must be respected so that Life can be possible on our planet.\nAs Head of State, I develop in my country the program \u201cA citizen, a tree\u201d which is progressively being implemented. To the citizens who contributed to the well-being of the communities, the Presidency of the Republic awards, annually, the Sergio Vieira de Mello award. In 2019, the prize was awarded to a civil society organization that reforested affected mangrove areas, In order to reduce plastic waste pollution, the country has adopted a recycling policy and we already have a small unit for processing and treating plastic bottles in order to produce relevant application material (brick for building houses and chairs for domestic use).\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nThe Indonesian invasion and occupation resulted in a prolonged conflict that seemed untractable. The UN\u2019s engagement was very relevant, and it became a success story. Allow me to emphasize the fact that the process of reconciliation between Indonesia and my country is an example of good neighborhood and cooperation, despite the painful and tragedy past.\nWe have been a full member of the United Nations for eighteen (18) years.\nAs an internationally recognized sovereign State, we are giving our contribution to shape a more updated and needed UN. One of our distinguished citizens, the former President, Jose Ramos Horta, chaired the High-Level Panel for peace operations. The panel aimed to reinforce the effectiveness of peace operations.\nAs an active member of the United Nations, we made our contribution to reinforcing the awareness on the Sustainable Development Goals. Our own experience pointed to the need for States to have strong institutions capable of facing the challenges and threats of modern times. We are convinced that international conflicts must be resolved through negotiation and dialogue. These tools allow the promotion of the peace that is so necessary for humankind. We are concerned by the recent increase in tension over the maritime dispute in the South China Sea. I proudly say that we were the first country to use the compulsory conciliation mechanism, advocated by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We call on all parties involved to resolve their differences through dialogue and negotiations in order to achieve a peaceful solution.\nWe feel that it is just, to call for an end to the embargo suffered by the People and the Government of Cuba. The solidarity of Cuban scientists, doctors and health professionals, in the fight against COVID-19, deserves our respect and admiration.\nHistory and language ties us to the countries and peoples that make up the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries, the CPLP. We were honored to preside over this Community for 2 years. We are concerned about the terrorist violence that befalls the north of Mozambique, a brother country.\nTime and again, we are all faced with racial and sexual violence. We strongly defend gender equality and the rights of minorities and indigenous peoples. Racism is unacceptable and absolutely abominable.\nMr. President,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nThis year of 2020 is the last year of the third international decade for the eradication of colonialism. In Western Sahara, the United Nations Mission \u2014 MINURSO \u2014 has been in the territory for almost three decades, but we have not yet seen satisfactory progress. It is urgent to appoint a Special Envoy of the Secretary General for Western Sahara in order to speed up the process of negotiations between the parties in conflict and find a solution that guarantees the Saharawi People the exercise of the right to self-determination, according to the United Nations Charter and other relevant Resolutions.\nWe have established diplomatic relations with both the Israeli and the Palestinian States. We are for the peaceful solution and the coexistence of two States in that so prone conflict region.\nMr. President,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nIt is with humility that I say to you: I myself have experience of suffering and adversity however I am deeply convinced that together we will come out stronger and we will win as humankind."

        "file_text": "President of the General Assembly, Volkan Bozkir,\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres,\nExcellencies, Heads of State and Permanent Representatives,\nIt is once again an honour for me to stand before the General Assembly on behalf of the People of Colombia, especially this year as we commemorate the United Nations seventy-fifth anniversary, which marks a milestone in the decision made by sisterly democratic nations to seek out and create space for common growth.\nMy country has understood the importance of dialogue to overcome obstacles and the urgent need for frank discussion to find common ground. That is why we exemplify a long tradition of participation in multilateral settings.\nFor example, we became the thirty-seventh member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and will become pro tempore President of the Forum for the Progress and Development of South America and the Pacific Alliance. That demonstrates our commitment to multilateralism and regional commitment to finding joint solutions that, in accordance with the United Nations call on us, will help us ensure that no one is left behind.\nThe increase in the loss of biodiversity is currently one of the major global issues. The current situation has shown us the close relationship between human health and that of ecosystems, the declining state of which is putting our survival as a species at risk.\nColombia stands out as the second most biodiverse country in the world with the greatest biodiversity per square kilometre. Colombia enjoys the fact that it accounts for 50 per cent of the world\u2019s paramos within a country that is 30 per cent Amazon rainforest.\nColombia has achieved an overall reduction of 30.9 million tons of carbon dioxide, while we have been waging an unprecedented battle against deforestation in our country\u2019s history. We therefore consider defending the environment as part of our national security.\nThat is how we have reduced deforestation by 19 per cent in the past two years and continue to do so. Through the Artemis project, we are making our decision to turn diversity into a strategic asset a reality, and, accordingly, we have recovered more than 6,000 hectares of our Parques Nacionales Naturales and prevented 23,000 hectares of forest from deforestation, while, at the same time, we are planting more than 35 million trees to bring us closer to our goal of planting 180 million by 2022.\nWe have also made progress in the area of capacity-building to produce renewable energy in the fight against climate change. Whereas in 2018 we had 30 megawatts of capacity connected to the national grid, today we have expanded that capacity almost five-fold, reaching an additional 140 megawatts, with the goal of continuing to increasing it 20-fold, in contrast to 2018, so that in 2022, our country will exceed 2,200 megawatts.\nWe reaffirm our commitment to making the Minamata Convention on Mercury a reality, and we declare our progress as a nation in the adoption of a law banning the use of asbestos and in promoting the use of electric vehicles. Likewise, we are waiting for the Congress of the Republic to adopt the Regional Agreement on Access to Information, Public Participation and Justice in Environmental Matters in Latin America and the Caribbean, known as the Escazu Agreement, which we signed at the end of last year.\nThe Leticia Pact, which I announced a year ago within the context of the General Assembly, has seen the realization of part of the call made by the Colombian Government, around which we have united seven States to implement a concrete action plan, which currently involves 52 specific actions for the conservation and sustainable development of the Amazon, while recognizing its importance as a strategic ecosystem for the planet.\nColombia has succeeded in getting more than 2,800 families from the Amazon region to participate in livestock restructuring projects and the production of nontimber products. In addition, more than 17,000 indigenous families are benefiting from governance and sustainable economy projects, and 15,000 of them are beneficiaries of payment for environmental services mechanisms involving nearly 219,000 hectares. That demonstrates what we are achieving in imagining the future.\nAnd just as we have led actions to protect the Amazon, the rainforests and the oceans, we call on all the nations of the planet to protect high-mountain ecosystems.\nColombia is home to half of the world\u2019s paramos, and today I call on the members of the General Assembly to join us in creating a global strategy for safeguarding the high-altitude ecosystems to ensure their survival and the sustainability of the communities that inhabit them. The paramos are veritable drinking-water factories and the source of the watersheds that irrigate much of our country.\nTherefore, we also call on the nations of the world to contribute resources and understand that the protection of the paramos is a universal duty.\nColombia is a magnificent country inhabited by men and women as diverse as its nature. We have lived through the onslaught of violence and poverty and are therefore committed to building a sustainable future based on equity.\nAchieving true peace is the social decision to build prosperity based on truth, solidarity, respect for law and the firm rejection of all forms of violence.\nThe Government has developed its Peace with Legality policy based on social stabilization and the institutional consolidation of the territories most historically affected by violence and poverty.\nThe Peace with Legality policy is benefiting more than 6 million fellow citizens in their territories, with an investment of more than $780 million, supporting the more than 13,500 former combatants, as well as changing their lives \u2014 with a sense of legal purpose and guarantees of non-repetition for more than 9 million victims.\nI would like to take the opportunity of being in this Hall to honour the victims of violence in my country. Likewise, I praise the work of those who every day make the million needed efforts into a reality \u2014 the social leaders who are building a more dignified and generous society, and who, despite the difficulties, are ceaseless in their efforts to build a country for all. We recognize their and all Colombians\u2019 vocation to build a future by bridging and healing wounds, while, at the same time, ensuring that brotherhood under a reliable legal system gives us reason for pride.\nToday in Colombia there are no conflicts between the friends and the enemies of peace. Today we are one country on the path moving forward regardless of whether the wind is with or against us.\nMultilateral tools have been key to the international community\u2019s contribution to that end, especially in terms of reparations for victims, strengthening rural development and formalizing property ownership in the remote corners of our country. I underscore and am grateful for the support of the United Nations Verification Mission in Colombia, which can exceptionally attest to the Government\u2019s outstanding progress in achieving peace with legality, that is, real peace.\nUnfortunately, all our efforts face a common threat \u2014 drug trafficking and the illicit economies it generates. For my country, the fight against drug trafficking is an ethical imperative, as it produces all forms of corruption, comprises a ubiquitous link in crime and is the source of social decay.\nDrug trafficking fuels human trafficking, arms trafficking, illegal mining, deforestation and smuggling. Drug trafficking tears families apart, breaches social values, constantly puts at risk the lives of millions of people around the world and fosters inequality, sowing hatred, violence and death in peaceful areas.\nDrug trafficking transcends borders, and my country has suffered as a victim because of this horrible fact. The transnational crime demands the joint action of all States, with a sense shared responsibility. In such shared challenges, we must act together, resolutely, energetically and unhesitatingly as a duty to future generations.\nThe situation caused by the coronavirus disease has also become a threat owing to the fissures caused by social inequalities.\nThe global crisis has highlighted both the strengths and weaknesses of multilateral tools. For instance, it showed that the need remains to define better cooperation mechanisms in circumstances of crisis, while those same tools have led to the search for joint solutions to overcome it, for example, in terms of finding a vaccine.\nWorking together with organizations such as the Pan-American Health Organization and the World Health Organization has been crucial throughout 2020 and will continue to be while we search for possible solutions to the crisis. Mechanisms, such as Vaccine Global Access, in which Colombia is actively participating, are essential to various nations\u2019 collaboration in the search for and distribution of an eventual vaccine. Solidarity and sustained cooperation among nations are essential if we are to successfully weather the storm of the pandemic.\nThe pandemic is proving to be a turning point in thinking about a sustainable and just future. Now that we are looking to revive our economies and restart leading productive lives, environmental sustainability needs to be the rallying point for building a more sustainable and responsible world.\nWithin that framework, the protection of regional democracy is a fundamental element. The threats to democracy we see today are putting at risk the freedom of nations, as well as preventing regional integration and cooperation to overcome challenges like those currently facing humankind.\nThe Maduro regime is sustained by resources from drug trafficking, harbours terrorists and poses a constant threat to the democracies of the region and the world.\nThe constant violations of human rights by the Maduro dictatorship, which we have condemned in our country and in international forums, including the International Criminal Court, have recently been confirmed by the United Nations.\nWhy? The goal sought in Venezuela together with crimes against humanity is to perpetuate the tyranny. And the entire international community without exception must reject the situation, and we need to stridently call on all the nations of the world to raise their voices to demand truly free elections \u2014 not the staged electoral performance to which the Venezuelan people will be taken to in December only to perpetuate the dictatorship. We must, therefore, reject the process, which is seeking to legitimize Maduro\u2019s dictatorship.\nColombia says to the world today that it looks to the future with optimism, with its head held high, and calls on its leaders to unite more so than ever, since the founding of the Organization, so that together we can overcome the unprecedented difficulties that these times have placed before us.\nI am certain that our greatest strength lies in our own humanity. I am convinced that when we look back on these months, we will see resilient peoples, who stood up to the challenges of their time and navigated the storms wisely.\nPresidents and Permanent Representatives, the future is in our hands.\nMany thanks."

        "file_text": "Mr President,\nExcellencies,\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\u201cThe survivors were immune, the others dead.\u201d\nThis is the rather pithy description of the end of the Spanish flu one hundred years ago by a German medical historian.\nSo pithy in fact that we recoil when we consider the pandemic that has a firm grip on our world today.\nThirty million people have already been infected by coronavirus.\nAlmost one million people have died.\nAnd its longer-term impacts \u2014 hunger, poverty, displacement and conflicts \u2014 are beginning to reach us only now.\nAnd yet 2020 isn\u2019t 1920.\nHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself \u2014 at least, if we don\u2019t allow it to.\nWe have a choice, ladies and gentlemen, and few things illustrate this more clearly than the experiences that we have made during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn the one hand, they show that a lack of transparency, coupled with disinformation and conspiracy theories, can kill.\nOn the other, they point to a path out of the crisis.\nIt is the path of reason that is founded on scientific expertise.\nThe path of cooperation that is based on common rules.\nRules all of us have to abide by. And that is why I\u2019m speaking to you today from quarantine at my home, having come into contact a few days ago with someone who tested positive for the virus.\nAnd I hope that the technology works and that you can understand what I\u2019m saying nonetheless.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nAs long as the virus is out there, it can affect each and every one of us.\nThat is why only when we get the pandemic under control throughout the world will we be able to overcome it in the long term.\nThose affected by it must be at the centre of all of our efforts. And the search for vaccines and medicines must not be a competition or a beauty contest.\nThis is why Germany has set aside more than three billion euro this year for global crisis management \u2014 with a particular focus on the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.\nAnd, as the biggest exporter of pharmaceutical products, we have expressed a clear commitment to distributing potential vaccines and medicines against COVID-19 in a fair way \u2014 as a global public good.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nThis crisis also shows that international cooperation is neither an ideology nor an end in itself.\nOn the contrary, it delivers results.\nFar beyond the actual pandemic.\nSuch as in Ukraine, where the negotiations between Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany have helped to bring about the longest ceasefire since the beginning of the conflict.\nHundreds of thousands of people in the east of the country are currently no longer living under the permanent spectre of war. This is grounds for hope for a genuinely permanent solution to the conflict.\nWe will take this hope as the basis for intensive engagement in the Normandy format in the coming months, including at high-ranking political level.\nIn Libya, too, we are focusing on cooperation with the United Nations in order to implement the decisions of the January Berlin Conference to the letter.\nThe rapprochement between the government in Tripoli and the forces in the east of the country that has taken place in recent weeks is a major step forward. However, forces outside the country must also fall into line at long last in order to achieve a solution. They must cease sending weapons and mercenaries, thus exacerbating the conflict.\nThis is what we will aim to achieve when Antonio Guterres and I gather together the supporters of the Berlin Process once again in early October in order to make them honour their commitments.\nThe latest developments in relations between Israel and the Arab countries in the Gulf are likewise grounds for hope \u2014 this is also the result of courageous cooperation.\nI have been in close dialogue with my counterparts from Jordan, Egypt and France in recent weeks, and we agreed that this new dynamic should be seized by the parties for fresh, credible negotiations on a two-state solution that alone holds the promise of lasting peace. For this, both sides must make compromises and refrain from violence, but also from unilateral steps such as annexation and settlement construction. Wherever we Europeans are able to support this \u2014 politically or economically \u2014 we will do so.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nDespite all the progress made in recent weeks, we\u2019re still a very long way from a new global attitude. The Secretary-General\u2019s call for a global ceasefire, which was adopted in the Security Council under Germany\u2019s Presidency in July, is falling on deaf ears in many places.\nThis is not only a problem as far as credibility of the Security Council is concerned.\nIt is, first and foremost, a disaster for millions of people in war and crisis areas who are utterly defenceless in the face of the pandemic.\n\u2022We need still greater efforts in the fight against violence and terrorism in the Sahel, and above all closer dialogue between the countries of the region, regional organisations and the international community.\nThis is what the Sahel Alliance, the Partnership for Security and Stability in the Sahel and the International Coalition for the Sahel are seeking to achieve.\nAnd we\u2019re supporting the efforts made by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to help Mali return to a constitutional order as swiftly as possible \u2014 as peace, stability and development are what the people there are calling for.\nFurthermore, ladies and gentlemen, a new, international effort is also needed in order to bring peace to Syria at long last.\nA nationwide ceasefire and a comprehensive, genuine constitutional process, as envisaged by Resolution 2254 (2015), are prerequisites before we can talk about reconstruction of the country.\nAnd until that time, we stand firmly by the side of the Syrian people \u2014 with humanitarian assistance, which must continue to be provided across borders.\nThere\u2019s another thing that is necessary for lasting peace, namely justice.\nThis is why we will continue to ensure that those responsible for the worst crimes against humanity \u2014 for murder, torture and rape \u2014 are held to account before German courts and why we will support the UN mechanisms for investigating these crimes with all our might.\nThis is by no means just about Syria, however. Those who don\u2019t clearly distinguish between perpetrators and victims, who blur the line between right and wrong, shake the very foundations of our rules-based order. Such people jeopardise our peaceful coexistence itself.\nThis applies to those who stand in the way of the work of institutions such as the International Criminal Court.\nThis applies to those who block the Security Council with one veto after another and who prevent its urgently needed reform with constantly new delay tactics.\nAnd this especially applies to those who contravene international law, although, as permanent members of the Security Council, they bear particular responsibility for upholding it.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that we have been confronted by a violation of an existential principle of international cooperation, namely the banning of chemical weapons.\nA violation of this \u2014 as we have been able to prove together with our partners in the poisoning of Alexei Navalny \u2014 is a problem for the entire international community.\nI call on Russia to do more to investigate this case. A case such as this must have consequences. The EU therefore reserves the right to impose sanctions.\nAnd we\u2019re grateful to our partners around the world fortheir unequivocal support.\nWe need this same determination, this same will to cooperate also with respect to other existential issues facing humanity.\nHere, once again, we have a choice.\nWe can continue to watch as our forests burn \u2014 and yet still deny the existence of human-induced climate change.\nOr we can listen to the voice of scientists and treat climate change as what it is, namely the biggest threat to security, prosperity and development on our planet.\nThis is also why we have firmly enshrined the issue of climate and security on the Security Council\u2019s agenda in recent months.\nAnd we\u2019re delighted that Norway, Ireland, Kenya, Mexico and others will continue to work on this when they are members of the Security Council next year.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nWe can continue to violate arms control treaties \u2014 thereby destroying trust that has been built up over many decades.\nOr we can put nuclear disarmament and non proliferation back on the international agenda \u2014 as we have done in recent months, not least with a view to the upcoming Review Conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\nEurope\u2019s efforts to promote the nuclear agreement with Iran must also be seen in this context.\nYes, we share the concerns about the end of the arms embargo as long as Iran threatens Israel and destabilises the entire region from Lebanon to Syria to Yemen.\nHowever, the destruction of the JCPOA doesn\u2019t get us any closer to an arms embargo. On the contrary, at best, the JCPOA\u2019s demise brings Iran closer to getting the atomic bomb.\nAnd this is why we, as JCPOA participants, continue to stand by its full applicability and call on Iran to likewise fully comply with the agreement.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nWe can watch human rights being hollowed out and trampled underfoot, even though all of us have committed to uphold them.\nOr we can stand by the side of those who are suppressed, abused and persecuted \u2014 such as the peaceful protesters in Belarus.\nWe have called on Lukashenko time and again to support a national dialogue, mediated by the OSCE. However, he has rejected all offers and is continuing to tread the path of violence and suppression.\nAnd this must also have consequences if we are serious about our values and our international agreements. We\u2019re discussing this in the European Union.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nCourageous decisions are needed especially in times of crisis.\nSeventy-five years ago \u2014 following the devastation of the Second World War that was unleashed by Germany \u2014 the international community decided:\nTo oppose war and to promote international cooperation.\nAnd to oppose the law of the strong and to promote the strength of the law.\nAnd so the United Nations was born. Thirty years ago \u2014 after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain \u2014 this decision was underpinned by the Charter of Paris. The Charter proclaimed that the \u201cera of confrontation and division of Europe\u201d had ended and that a \u201cnew era of democracy, peace and unity\u201d had begun.\nToday, in the midst of the pandemic, it is our generation that faces a choice.\nEither we go it alone, without taking others into consideration, and throw this multilateral legacy to the winds.\nOr we renew this legacy and show that the right response to the crises of our age is \u201cmore solidarity\u201d \u2014 \u201cmore cooperation\u201d and \u201cmore justice\u201d.\nGermany is prepared to do just this.\nTogether with you \u2014 as genuinely united nations.\nThank you very much \u2014 and stay healthy!"

        "file_text": "Mr. President of the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Secretary-General of the United Nations, ladies and gentlemen, Heads of State and Government, dear delegates,\nEach generation has faced its own problems and challenges. It is up to our generation to face especially difficult and demanding problems and challenges. Some have emerged unexpectedly, such as the coronavirus pandemic and the global economic recession. Others already existed but have manifested themselves with greater force, such as climate change and global warming.\nThe challenges of our generation are the mothers of all battles, because they are battles to ensure our survival.\nCOVID-19\nA year ago, nobody could have imagined that an invisible and microscopic virus was going to cause the worst health, social and economic catastrophe in 100 years. No country was prepared to face it, and, so long as there is no effective and safe vaccine, we will have to learn to live with this virus, which has changed our ways of working, studying, obtaining supplies and interacting \u2014 in short, the way we live our lives fully.\nThis means a tremendous challenge and a great opportunity.\nHow has Chile faced this formidable challenge?\nOur first priority and task is to protect the health and lives of all, especially those of our elderly and of at-risk groups. That is why we launched a Health Protection Plan that has made it possible to triple the capacity of our health system and carry out more than 3 million PCR tests, covering about 15 per cent of our population.\nBut this task does not end with health protection. That is certainly necessary but not sufficient.\nProtecting the health and lives of our compatriots also requires ensuring that families have supplies of basic goods and services and protecting jobs, incomes, small and medium-sized enterprises and the functioning of our economy.\nChileans have faced very tough and difficult months. For that reason, our Government developed a Social Protection Plan to protect the income and jobs of middle-class and vulnerable families that today covers more than 14 million Chileans. That means that almost three of every four Chileans are protected by this Special Social Protection Network, which we have built in these six months of emergency.\nBut it is not enough to protect our compatriots only during this emergency. We must be able to look to the future and move towards lasting protection. To that end it is vital to recover the almost 2 million jobs we have lost, relaunch our economy and get our country back on track. Therefore, two weeks after the first coronavirus contagion in Chile, we promoted an Economic Recovery Plan that mobilizes about 12 per cent of GDP.\nWe must prevent this transitory health crisis from turning into a serious economic and social crisis of a more permanent nature.\nWhat must the world do to confront this pandemic effectively and emerge stronger? Only collaborative and multilateral solutions will allow us to overcome this crisis and emerge stronger.\nThis pandemic, which does not recognize or respect borders, nationality or ethnicity, has shown us the need to strengthen international collaboration and governance as well as the tremendous interdependence of the international community.\nIt is in these times of crisis that we most need leadership and multilateral cooperation. The great Powers, instead of permanently confronting each other in the economic and health fields, should lead the fight against this pandemic and global recession and not create a large and worrisome leadership vacuum.\nWith respect to health issues, this includes sharing diagnoses and knowledge, coordinating border closures and openings, joining forces for the development and availability of an effective and safe vaccine, and cooperating with the most vulnerable countries.\nThe trade war we are experiencing today has led to stagnation in international trade and investment, the weakening of free trade, sources of protectionism and a deadlock in the World Trade Organization. To promote free trade and integration, combat protectionism, eliminate non-tariff barriers to trade, harmonize regulations and rules, and prevent and sanction unilateral behaviour that contravenes the international order, we need to rebuild a multilateral economic order that is respected by all and rules-based.\nFurthermore, we must unite to prevent this global pandemic and recession from strengthening the authoritarianism and populism promoted by those who have tried to take advantage of this crisis. We cannot sacrifice the freedoms that we have won at so great a price, as this would pose a tremendous threat to democracy and to the development of our countries.\nWhat lessons and opportunities has this pandemic offered us?\nFirst, to be more humble. Despite all the scientific and technological advances made, this virus has taught us the vulnerability and precariousness of human life and our societies.\nSecondly, to learn to listen more attentively to the voices of science, local authorities and civil society, and always be ready to change course when necessary.\nThirdly, the value of the family, which has been the main sustenance in facing and overcoming the consequences of this time of adversity.\nCLIMATE CHANGE AND GLOBAL WARMING\nThe coronavirus pandemic and global economic recession have shifted the spotlight away from climate change and global warming. But these serious threats continue to increase, and our best option is without a doubt to confront them simultaneously.\nHuman beings are the most intelligent and ingenious creatures on planet Earth. But they are also the only creatures capable of destroying their own planet.\nLet us tell it as it is. The threat of global warming is real and imminent. Science has spoken loud and clear. Citizenship demands a change of course as a moral imperative, technology provides us with the necessary tools, and common sense urges us to action.\nThe scientific evidence is categorical \u2014 the concentration of greenhouse gases and the current average temperature are the highest in the past 800,000 years. We are being ravaged by intense heat waves, large floods, intense periods of drought and powerful hurricanes. In addition, we are suffering from severe landslides and melting ice at the poles, ocean pollution, sea-level increases, fires and forest destruction and many other worrisome phenomena. And the most serious thing is that these changes used to take millions of years. Now they occur in just decades. The time for diagnoses is over. The time for action is here.\nChile is fully committed to fighting climate change, which has inspired and mobilized millions of citizens. We were one of the first 10 countries to significantly enhance our nationally determined contribution, thereby fulfilling the commitments we undertook in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. We are moving forward with a framework law on climate change, already unanimously approved by the Senate, which sets the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 and lays out strategies, plans and instruments to meet that goal.\nWe have assumed the commitment to transforming Chile into a carbon-neutral country by 2050, with zero net emissions, which we will accomplish through several actions. The first is the total closure of coal-fired plants before 2040. Today, 44 per cent of our energy sources are clean and renewable, and by 2030 we will reach 70 per cent. Secondly, we will focus on electromobility. We are replacing the fossil fuels in our transportation system with electricity or other clean fuels. By 2040, 100 per cent of our urban public transport will be electric. Outside of China, our capital city now has the most electric buses in the world. Thirdly, we will promote energy efficiency in all sectors and special tariffs to gradually replace wood heating with electric heating. Lastly, we will ensure the protection of our forests and promote biodiversity and reforestation, favouring native species and nature-based solutions. In order to successfully fulfil that mission we are building a true Climate Ambition Alliance, incorporating the State, the private sector, civil society and our citizens.\nWe are also replacing throwaway culture with the culture of recycling and are moving from a linear to a circular economy. We have eliminated plastic bags and have already prevented the production of 5 billion bags \u2014 used for only minutes \u2014 from polluting our planet for centuries.\nThis is the great challenge of our generation \u2014 to make up for lost time and change the course of history to ensure the survival and quality of life of human beings on planet Earth.\nI want to share with the Assembly some reflections on our region of Latin America, which has all it needs to be a developed region \u2014 vast and generous territories and abundant and multiple natural resources. We have not seen the wars that destroyed Europe last century or the religious conflicts that have caused so much damage throughout history. And yet, despite the important progress made in many fields, we remain an underdeveloped continent, with almost one-third of our population living in poverty \u2014 a scourge that the coronavirus crisis will significantly worsen.\nWe have not been able to take full advantage of the talents and opportunities of our people. We have not been able to move towards true regional integration. And we are behind in joining the technological and digital revolution, which has ushered in the knowledge and information society.\nWe are undoubtedly making efforts to make up for lost time. Eight years ago, we created the Pacific Alliance, which is a regional benchmark for economic integration. A year ago, we created the Forum for the Progress and Development of South America, a body for coordination and collaboration among the democratic countries of South America, which has been very helpful in responding to the coronavirus pandemic.\nHowever, we have also had setbacks that threaten freedom, human rights, democracy, the rule of law and our quality of life. One example of where those principles are constantly violated is the tragic situation in Venezuela \u2014 a country suffering the most serious political, social, economic and humanitarian crisis in its history. The best solution to the Venezuelan crisis is the establishment of a transitional Government and the holding of free and democratic elections so that the Venezuelan people may freely choose their rulers and the path to follow.\nThe whole world is being threatened by populism and irresponsibility, which always means the easy way \u2014 the path of rights without duties and achievements without effort, of progress without work, of asserting one\u2019s rights without respecting those of others, and of promises of easy solutions to difficult problems. Democracies are founded on freedom, and freedom demands responsibility. That freedom and responsibility are especially needed in times of crisis, which tend to foment populism.\nIn recent times, our region, too, has seen social outbreaks and waves of violence. Chile is no exception. Thirty years ago, with the firm will and commitment of our people, we peacefully regained our democracy and gave life to a new and modern republic based on three basic agreements: first, a deep commitment to democracy, the rule of law and the protection of human rights; secondly, a strong commitment to a free, open and competitive market economy; and thirdly, the firm determination to defeat poverty and promote equal opportunity.\nThe facts show that these commitments were productive. During this period, we increased our per capita income fivefold. We reduced poverty from more than 60 per cent to less than 10 per cent, saving 8 million Chileans, more than half of our population, from the clutches of poverty. A large and diverse middle class emerged. Life expectancy increased, infant mortality decreased and the coverage, quality and access to education at all levels rose from 230,000 to 1.2 million students in higher education, most of them first generation.\nThese achievements are the result of the work of many Governments and various political movements, which committed themselves to the mission of defeating poverty and achieving development in democracy and peace.\nHowever, over the past 30 years, we have not been able to leverage our growth potential to reduce inequalities, stop abuses, move towards equal opportunity or improve services in such important areas as education, welfare and health.\nLate last year, important social movements emerged in Chile and in other countries of our region and the world. In Chile, citizens of all ages and sectors took to the streets to demand better pensions, better health and better education. They also demanded fewer inequalities, improved and more affordable public services, greater equality before the law and better control of abusive behaviour. Despite certain progress, those demands had been accumulating for decades.\nThe Government listened to those demands carefully, with sensitivity and with a sense of urgency, and quickly put in place a new social agenda to address them and promote solutions.\nUnfortunately, alongside demonstrations, our country also experienced a huge and unexpected outbreak of violence, fires, riots, destruction and crime, which respected nothing and no one, and gravely harmed Chile\u2019s body and soul.\nIn a democracy, we cannot tolerate any form of violence, be it physical or through social networks. Violence, threats and intolerance are incompatible with a democratic society, which must always be based on respect, dialogue and the peaceful resolution of disputes.\nDuring these difficult and violent months, while exercising our duty to restore public order and safeguard citizen security, for which we had to resort to the States of Constitutional Exception provided for in our Constitution, our Government took all possible and necessary measures and precautions to guarantee respect for the human rights of all. We applied strict norms to regulate the use of force by the police, in full compliance with international human rights standards. We adopted a policy of full transparency to our citizens in terms of human rights-related information, and we strengthened the public defender system. To support and facilitate their task of autonomously protecting human rights, we granted our National Human Rights Institute and the Office of the Children\u2019s Ombudsperson full logistical support and access, upon their request, to all police, hospital and prison facilities, inter alia. We invited the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Inter- American Commission on Human Rights to monitor the situation in the country.\nAll evidence of abuse or excessive use of force was placed at the disposal of the Office of the Prosecutor, which by constitutional mandate has the duty to investigate the facts and bring them, when appropriate, to the Courts of Justice so that they may be judged and sanctioned in accordance with the law, as befits a democracy and the rule of law. We will make every effort to ensure that there is no impunity in Chile, neither for those who violate human rights nor for the violators who attack society.\nIn these difficult times, when our democracy has been threatened, our Government proposed \u2014 and Chile opted for \u2014 an institutional and peaceful solution to the conflict through constitutional reform that gave rise to a process that will begin this 25 October with a citizen plebiscite. I am convinced that the immense majority of Chileans want to perfect, modernize or change our Constitution. In the 25 October plebiscite, the citizens will democratically choose the way forward.\nThis crisis is an opportunity to reach a constitutional agreement that will allow our Constitution to be a great framework of unity and stability and of projection into the future. It is also an opportunity to better connect with our citizens and move forward with greater strength and urgency towards a freer and more just society, with greater equality of opportunity, where everyone is equal in dignity and equal before the law, and where progress and development are more inclusive and sustainable.\nWe must learn from the lessons of the past that have taught us the value of unity, dialogue, collaboration and agreement. After all, a house divided cannot prevail. We must also act with a sense of urgency because we have no time to lose and because there will be no social justice without growth and development, and no growth and development without social justice.\nChile is a country proud of its history, traditions and identity. It is a country with a strong vocation for collaboration and international integration, a country where we always ask ourselves how we can, together with other nations, contribute to making the world a home with greater freedom, peace, prosperity and justice and where the environment is protected. That is why Chile contributes to the international community in many ways.\nFirst, Chile contributes by caring for and protecting the Antarctic, which is the largest freshwater reserve in the world and plays a fundamental role in combating climate change and mitigating temperature increase and ice melt. It is also a true natural laboratory for science.\nSecondly, Chile contributes to the development of astronomy. The unique combination of high peaks, low humidity and clear skies has meant that 70 per cent of the world\u2019s astronomical observation capacity is located in our country.\nThirdly, we are creating marine protected areas. With pride and effort, more than 42 per cent of Chile\u2019s sea is protected. Further, 21 per cent of our land areas is protected, through parks, reserves and national monuments.\nFourthly, we are developing the energies of the future. Chile was poor in fossil fuels and the pollutants of the past, but we are immensely rich in the clean and renewable energies of the future. The high solar radiation of our deserts gives them gigantic potential for generating solar energy. The intensity and regularity of the winds allow for high capacity in generating wind energy. In addition, we are making progress in the energies of tomorrow, developing green hydrogen, which, as a fuel that does not generate greenhouse-gas emissions, will benefit the whole world. The abundance of copper and lithium gives us great potential in terms of electromobility.\nFifthly, Chile is connecting South America with Oceania and Asia through the trans-Pacific fibre-optic cable, which will promote regional integration, innovation and digital society.\nSixthly, we are producing healthy and safe food to supply tables around the world with multiple products.\nChile and the rest of the world have just lived through the hardest and most challenging months in recent history. I am sure that Chile will once again manifest the noble and supportive soul of our country and prove the resilience and mettle of its people. Together we will continue to build a country where it is good to be born, grow, study, work, raise a family and age \u2014 a common home, the home of all Chileans, where we can think differently, respect each other and together build a country and a better future that we can leave with pride and hope to successive generations."

        "file_text": "It is a distinct honour for me, on behalf of His Majesty\u2019s Government, and the people of the Kingdom of Tonga, to address the United Nations General Assembly, for the first time, as Prime Minister. I thank the God Almighty for enabling us the opportunity to meet virtually in the midst of this global pandemic.\nI warmly congratulate Your Excellency on the assumption of your presidency at this historical milestone, where the United Nations commemorate the 75th anniversary of its founding.\nTonga pledges our unwavering support towards the success of your term, and we welcome the theme for this session \u201cThe Future We Want, the UN We Need: Reaffirming our Collective Commitment to Multilateralism\u201d.\nAllow me to also pay tribute to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Tijjani MuhammadBande, in successfully spearheading the 74th session of the General Assembly during these unprecedented and most difficult times.\nI applaud the oversight and dynamic leadership of His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres in safely navigating the operations of the United Nations in coordination with Member States in the fight against the pandemic.\nMr. President,\nIn the context of the defining health crisis of our time, Tonga stands in solidarity with all Member States, who have been affected by the deleterious impact of the global outbreak, resulting in the loss of precious lives and loved ones. I express our sincere sympathy and heartfelt condolences to those Member States.\nWhile the virus has not arrived on our shores, Tonga is not immune to the overwhelming global challenges that beset us at this juncture. We have activated emergency measures to that effect while undertaking risk assessments and prioritizing the procurement of medical equipment to strengthen our health system preparedness and response.\nIn that connection, I express gratitude to all of our Development Partners and the international community for their generous financial and humanitarian assistance, in addition to logistical support, which have aptly facilitated Tonga\u2019s response to remain vigilant amidst this global pandemic.\nThe economic impacts are affecting different sectors of our economy. According to the Asia Development Bank (ADB), Tonga will encounter a zero economic growth in 2020, however, the situation is astutely managed within, through activation of financial stimulus while priority is given to health-related activities. In regard to education, digital divide is made more evident by COVID-19, requiring accelerated solutions for the new norm of teaching via internet, radio and television considering thousands of students in Tonga that will be affected if education is disrupted by COVID-19 or a similar pandemic in the future.\nGiven the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Pacific Island Forum Leaders invoked the Biketawa and Boe Declaration, pronouncing the pandemic a major crisis to our Pacific peoples and economies. The activation of this declaration has expedited assistance and cooperation between member countries as well as cooperation with the international community in response to the COVID-19, including facilitating the timely repatriation of our stranded Tongan people abroad.\nMr. President,\nWhile Small Island Developing States, including Tonga, contribute to no more than one percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, it is unfortunate that we continue to bear the brunt of this climate injustice. As a result, the Pacific Island countries continue to be imperiled by many tropical cyclones of unprecedented magnitudes and destructive in nature. The most recent one was Tropical Cyclone Harold in April of this year which wreaked havoc on four Pacific Island nations, namely, Fiji, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and my own country, Tonga. This is while we grapple with the distressing effect of the COVID-19 outbreak.\nOur Pacific Island Forum Leaders have consistently echoed the need for urgent climate action in their communique, every year, for at least the last 30 years. This year marks the fifth-year anniversary of the adoption of the Paris Agreement. And it is only befitting for us to capture this historic moment through reaffirming our commitment to achieving the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. Tonga is currently reviewing its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and its Enhanced NDCs will be submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat this year.\nThough the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) to the UNFCCC that was to be held in Glasgow, United Kingdom, has been postponed to 2021, Tonga remains committed to prepare its Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategies (LT-LEDS) which will be communicated to the Secretariat of the UNFCCC at COP 26.\nWhile 2020 is marked as the \u201cYear of Delivery\u201d for powering the sustainable development for our Kingdom through the attainment of 50 per cent Renewable Energy penetration, the project delays caused by the global pandemic, through the sudden halt to the market supply chains, has led to a major disruption on Tonga\u2019s NDCs in the achievement of this target.\nHowever, agreements have been signed for grant funding, by way of public private partnership and the fervent support of Development Partners, will continue to drive Tonga\u2019s SDG7 and its objectives through the composition of innovative technologies such as Solar, Wind, Battery Energy Storage Systems coupled with the Network Rehabilitation and increase accessibility of electricity to the furthest most islands of Tonga.\nMr. President,\nTonga continues to recognize the importance of the ocean-climate nexus, and further continues to note with grave concern the detrimental impacts of climate change on our marine environment.\nWe endeavour to achieve SDG 14 through advancing our commitment to conserve and sustainably use the world\u2019s ocean, seas and marine resources through measures taken to establish Special Management Areas (SMAs) initiatives, and the implementation of the Tonga Marine Spatial Planning Project. Government has approved the inclusion of a network of 30 per cent Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) for the Kingdom. Tonga progresses well in relation to improved fisheries management and the fight against illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing to secure oceans contribution to food security and the well-being of the country\u2019s economy.\nIn the fight against plastic pollution, it is worrisome for Tonga to note the alarming 12 million tonnes of plastic wastes that are leaked into our oceans annually. We place great interest in addressing this threat by beginning the process to ban single-use plastics. While this is not only a national and a regional problem, it is also a global problem, requiring a global solution.\nMr. President,\nWhile countries around the world are enforcing lockdowns and restrictions in varying degrees in the fight against the COVID-19, it may not occur to many that the \u201cocean\u201d plays a pivotal role in this context. According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (or UNESCO), the bacteria used to detect the presence of COVID-19 is found in the depths of the ocean.\nWe cannot overemphasize the urgency for action to protect and sustainably use the world\u2019s ocean, seas and marine resources. However, actions can only be meaningful and effective if derived from science-based and innovative information and data. We support the proclamation by the United Nations of the Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development from 2021-2030 which provides an overarching framework that will allow ocean science to support countries in their sustainable development of the ocean.\nMr. President,\nTonga maintains that the baselines which presently determine our territorial boundaries, once established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, should remain unchanged despite effects of sea level rise and any climate change modification that might ensue. Our Sovereignty must not be compromised to that effect. We continue to support the work of the International Law Commission in the Sixth Committee.\nThe much anticipated Fourth Session of the Inter-Governmental Conference on an international legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction has been postponed to March 2021, tentatively, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We look forward to participating in this very important process.\nTonga is greatly invested in engaging as a State Party to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea in the International Seabed Authority and its continuing work on the draft exploitation regulations with other State Parties and stakeholders to ensure agreement on the appropriate balance between the need to conserve, protect and replenish the environment, and to mine the seabed for minerals that will contribute to the sustainable development of Tonga as a Small Island Developing State in the Pacific.\nMr. President,\nTonga is pleased to have ratified and become a State Party to the following conventions this year: (1) the United Nations Convention against Corruption; (2) the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards; and (3) the International Labour Organization Convention No. 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labour.\nFollowing Tonga\u2019s presentation of its first national review at the High-Level Political Forum in July 2019, it made good progress in the implementation of its SDG targets, however, the intervening devastating impacts of the COVID-19 have impeded progress going forward. These have intensified the vulnerabilities of our country and affected the implementation of some of Tonga\u2019s national outcomes under the Strategic Development Framework, which are ultimately linked to the achievement of the priority areas of the SAMOA Pathway and our SDG targets. Tonga is committed to engaging with the High-Level Political Forum which remains an integral platform, even more so, as we brace to embark on this much anticipated Decade of Action from 2021-2030, geared for accelerated solutions to achieve the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nWe acknowledge with gratitude the positive engagement of our Development Partners and all United Nations agencies including the UN Office of the High Representative for Least Developing Countries (LDCs), LLDCs and Small Islands Developing Countries (SIDS); the World Health Organization (WHO); the UN Department for Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA); the UNDP; the UN ESCAP; the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, as well as the Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs).\nMr. President,\nAllow me to conclude by reaffirming our commitment to a revitalized post COVID-19 multilateralism in support of the theme for this session. A multilateralism comprised of global solidarity and cooperation, empathy, inclusivity and resilience, noting the importance of protecting vulnerable individuals, addressing inequalities and ensuring universal access to affordable COVID-19 medical vaccine, while building back better, and leaving no one behind."

        "file_text": "Excellences, Ladies and Gentlemen, dear Friends, Mr. President\nWe are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the United Nations. 75 years ago, our predecessors were able to utilize their experience of a devastating world war and took the lead to building a vision of a better world.\nA world of prosperity and peace.\nA world of global wellbeing.\nA world of global cooperation serving future generations.\nThey established the United Nations.\nAnd here we are today, Dear Friends, a family of nations facing no less devastating threats: a global health and economic crisis, degradation of environment \u2014 all that threaten the wellbeing of our kind and our home \u2014 our Planet.\nThe best means of addressing the current global threats is effective multilateralism. Less multilateral cooperation would only magnify problems and challenges we are facing in all our societies.\nTo face the threats to Humanity nowadays, to build our common resilience, Ladies and Gentlemen, no one can be strong enough alone; we need to be vigilant, active, responsible, brave and wise \u2014 TOGETHER.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nIn a rapidly changing global environment, we increasingly depend on new technologies and digital infrastructure.\nNew technologies and artificial intelligence have already become the backbone of our daily lives that keep businesses and essential public services running.\nWe need to frame them in service of humankind. Slovenia makes an effort in this direction with the very first UNESCO global center for artificial intelligence established in Ljubljana last November.\nOne of the main challenges is cybersecurity. According to our view, cyberspace should be secure, global, open, free and inclusive.\nThe fragmentation and weakening of international security regimes is worrying. This should only strengthen our commitment for effective, treaty-based international arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation.\nAll pressing proliferation issues should be solved by diplomatic and peaceful means.\nPrecondition for achieving sustainable peace and reconciliation, is to deal with grave violations of Human rights. We therefore support International Criminal Court as a central institution to fight impunity.\nWe will continue to engage in partnership and cooperation in the UN and other fora.\nSlovenia is especially active in landmines clearance efforts, affecting the lives of civilians, in particular children. I am glad to report that ITF Enhancing Human Security, a Slovenian non-profit organization, managed to maintain its operational capacity and presence in the field in the midst of the pandemic.\nMr President,\nSustainable Development Goals are a clear roadmap for green and healthy planet. Slovenia as the EU Presidency in second half of 2021 will put environmental protection very high on the agenda. The COP26 next year should be a real game-changer.\nRecently and for the first time, Slovenia contributed one million Euros to the UN Green Climate Fund.\nExcellences,\nSlovenia shares the awareness of biodiversity loss as an urgent global challenge.\nWe put the right to clean drinking water in our constitution. We recognize preservation of water resources as a key element to protect biodiversity.\nOn Slovenia\u2019s initiative, the UN proclaimed a World Bee Day, celebrated on 20th of May, recognizing the importance of bees and other pollinators for food security, biodiversity and sustainable development.\nMy personal advocacy to environmental protection is both global and local, based on introducing public debates on climate change, establishing committee for climate policy and supporting youth movements.\nI would like to reaffirm Slovenia\u2019s and my personal commitment to stop an unprecedented rate of biodiversity loss and halt climate change effects.\nThis is why I join the \u201cLeaders Pledge for nature\u201d.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nThe COVID-19 crisis brought about a stark realization of the importance of solidarity and cooperation \u2014 among ourselves and within multilateral organizations, such as the World Health Organization.\nCOVID-19 pandemic has left devastating social and economic consequences. Lives depend on accurate and timely information. A full exercise of the rights to freedom of expression, access to public information and the protection of journalists are key to wellbeing of our societies.\nMy country, Slovenia, came into being, inspired by the quest for democracy and fundamental rights. We know \u2014 and the current COVID-19 crisis has confirmed \u2014 that human rights can never been taken for granted.\nThe situation of the most vulnerable groups \u2014 those without sufficient health care and those that are prosecuted and historically marginalized, has further worsened.\nWe need to stress once again that there is no place for discrimination based on any personal status in modern societies.\nNobody should be left behind.\nAs we mark 25 years of adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action we celebrate gains in gender equality and women empowerment.\nDear Friends,\n75 years ago our mothers and fathers said \u201cnever again\u201d. They said \u201cNO\u201d to another total war, pointless deaths and suffering, no to nationalistic and extremist tendencies, no to a life in uncertainty and fear.\nI \u2014 as well as many of you, grew up in peace and prosperity, in a world, built on the values and ideas of the UN founders. Yes, the UN has failed to prevent all the conflicts, could and should oftentimes react quicker, better, more determined. Nevertheless, we have to agree that the world has been a better place since 24 October 1945 because of the United Nations.\nHowever, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nThe world today is a very different place than 75 years ago. Today\u2019s world is less predictable and less secure than it was yesterday.\nAmidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the very fact that we are celebrating this important anniversary in this unprecedented way \u2014 each of us from her/his different part of the world, clearly indicates that we are capable to adapt. Adapt to do our joint work for the one humanity and the one planet that we all share.\nLet me therefore take this opportunity to reaffirm Slovenia\u2019s commitment to the multilateral cooperation in the framework of the UN and other international and regional organizations, including within the scope of its EU membership and presidency in 2021.\nWith this in mind, it is vital that progress is made on respect for human rights, international law and the rule of law and on a comprehensive, inclusive, and sustainable development of our societies.\nThe world is increasingly connected and interdependent. The COVID-19 crisis has undoubtedly shown that.\nWe, and the UN as an institution, have to change and grow with it. I am convinced we can best address global challenges through our joint action.\n75 years ago, our predecessors have built the first bridge. Today our world is a tight network of bridges, and I ask you, for the sake of the present and future generations, for the sake of your loved ones and yourself, do not tear them down.\nI wish to congratulate all of us.\nI wish to congratulate and thank our predecessors, who were brave and visionary enough to start it all.\nI wish to congratulate generation of our parents and our own generation to keep it going despite all the obstacles.\nAnd I wish our youth, who is slowly taking over, the courage and wisdom to do better than us.\nI would like to give the final word to the eminent Slovenian novelist Boris Pahor, also known as the oldest known survivor of the Nazi concentration camps, and who is at its 107 years of age still outspoken fighter against all totalitarianisms.\nHe says: \u201cHumanity has enough wisdom and power to find a path to lead us out of the crises, towards becoming a more ethical human being.\u201d I believe him.\nHVALA! Thank you!\u201c"

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nI am honored to address the seventy-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly.\nOne year ago, nobody could have imagined that this anniversary would be marked by a global challenge unseen since the very foundation of this Organization. But here we are, unable to meet face to face, and yet ready to make our contributions to solving the most pressing global issues.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has swept through every part of the world, leaving a devastating cost. We have paid not only in human lives, but also in a deepened social inequality.\nThat was a colossal wake-up call for multilateralism. No country can tackle the pandemic and overcome the profound economic and social impact alone. Our fight against COVID-19 requires better international cooperation and solidarity. Multilateral institutions are crucial to our peace, security and well-being.\nAs I offer condolences to all those who have lost their loved ones, I reiterate Lithuania\u2019s commitment to help others. My country has already assisted the countries most affected by the coronavirus pandemic in Africa, Central and East Asia, Europe and the Middle East. We will continue to do so in the nearest future!\nMr. President,\nAt the time when global insecurity is rapidly growing, peace should remain our top priority. We must show respect to the international law, effectively protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, and promote economic and social cohesion on a global scale.\nWithout security there can be no better future for all. My country, Lithuania, knows this perfectly well. Together with two other Baltic States we have experienced the worst terrors of the 20th century. The end of the Second World War did not bring us freedom. The very moment one totalitarian regime fell, it was replaced by another \u2014 all three Baltic States were forcefully annexed by the Soviet Union.\nThis experience helped to create our special relationship with the Charter of the United Nations. We have learned to cherish and respect the fundamental principles of the international order. We learned to dream about freedom, democracy, the rule of law, human rights, the rules-based international order, and multilateral cooperation. This is what we value up to this day. This is who we are. This is what we offer to the world.\nThe century-old mistakes must not be repeated. Our security and stability depend on a proper assessment of the troublesome past. We must defend objective historical narratives that are increasingly under attack by the revisionist forces.\nHistory should not be a tool for manipulation, disinformation and propaganda. It shall not be used to whitewash the past crimes or to serve the current political agenda.\nTherefore, we reject the outdated worldview that the powerful can divide the world into spheres of interests. Secret agreements like those in Moscow in 1939 or in Yalta in 1945 must never be signed again. It should be clear to everyone that all countries are full members of the international community \u2014 with equal rights and obligations!\nMr. President,\nIt is highly unfortunate that today we witness attempts to undermine the values of the United Nations. The ongoing violations of the international law and human rights, as well as the abuse of power against own citizens, sadly, remain part of our collective reality.\nThe ongoing crisis in Belarus is a prime example of this worrying trend. The fraudulent presidential elections on 9 August led to massive unprecedented protests of the peaceful and brave Belarusian people who flooded the country\u2019s streets. The illegitimate regime willfully uses brutal force against the participants of peaceful protests. The released detainees report inhumane conditions in the detention facilities. There are clear indications that individuals are beaten and tortured in cold blood by special police teams.\nAll this is happening in Europe at the time when we all mark the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations and its founding document. We should treat this offense against justice and the rule of law with aversion and contempt. Allowing it to go unnoticed and without response would only foster a climate of impunity and undermine the rule of law on a global scale.\nThe very fundamentals of democratic societies \u2014 the basic freedoms of speech and expression, as well as the right for self-determination \u2014 are under attack in Belarus. The time has clearly come to defend the values of the international community. The United Nations and its institutions should closely monitor the situation in Belarus and insistently call on its authorities to refrain from the use of force, to ensure adherence to the principles of international law and human rights and to finally start a peaceful transition of power.\nI believe the international community must send a strong message to the current authorities of Belarus. All unlawfully detained people and political prisoners must be released, and those responsible for the use of force and tortures must be held accountable. It is imperative that the Human Rights Council monitors and evaluates the human rights situation in Belarus on a permanent basis. All crimes against humanity and massive violations of human rights must be investigated without delay! Mr. President, the true power of the United Nations Charter relies on our readiness to defend its core principles, including the firm faith in fundamental human rights.\nMy country remains committed to upholding human rights at home and abroad. We will not stand aside while witnessing rising global challenges to fundamental freedoms. We are deeply worried that the deteriorating security situation, worsening media climate and the shrinking space for civil society and human rights defenders might slowly become a new norm.\nSeeking to make a lasting contribution and support human rights, Lithuania for the first time presented its candidacy for membership in the United Nations Human Rights Council.\nIf elected for the term starting in 2022, Lithuania would pay close attention to the safety of journalists and the protection of human rights defenders, as well as the rights of women and girls, the rights of the child, the rights of persons with disabilities, freedoms of expression, assembly and association.\nMr. President,\nThese are the troubled times. The ongoing conflicts continue to devastate many regions around the world. Millions of people are still suffering, some of them \u2014 in Lithuania\u2019s immediate neighborhood. As the recent case of Alexey Navalny\u2019s poisoning shows, in some countries the pressure directed against opposition voices quickly turns into a deadly physical action.\nIf we honestly seek to maintain international order, we must be prepared to investigate the crimes against humanity and punish the perpetrators by all the available means.\nThis principle should also apply to those who intentionally break the international norms. More than a decade has passed since Russia invaded Georgia. One fifth of Georgian territory remains occupied by Russian forces in an evident violation of the international law. The situation in the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia is worsening due to renewed \u2018borderization\u2019 activities, restricted movement and illegal detentions of local people.\nFurthermore, for the sixth-year Russian forces are occupying Ukrainian Crimea and continuing military actions in Eastern Ukraine. Lithuania welcomes Ukraine\u2019s efforts to negotiate an end to the war and calls on Russia to move closer to a sustainable political resolution. Any future agreement should fully respect Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity \u2014 no other solution is possible.\nMy country continues to support Georgian and Ukrainian independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within the internationally recognized borders. No occupation, be it Crimea and Sevastopol, or Abkhazia and South Ossetia, will be forgotten or forgiven! Restoring justice is the only way forward.\nAt the same time, we are witnessing a deteriorating security situation in the Middle East and Africa. It comes with lower respect for human rights and democratic standards, loss of life, social unrest and largescale migration flows. Despite all the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General, including his global ceasefire call, no major war or conflict has seen a credible halt in fighting. Libya suffers upticks in violence; Yemen, as well as parts of Syria, rebel-held areas and camps for the displaced, face the worst humanitarian disaster; in Sahel, people encounter the many dangers of terrorism. It is our common responsibility to stop this worrying trend!\nMr. President,\nAs a responsible member of the international community, Lithuania remains loyal to the commitments of the United Nations Goals for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. In the face of accelerating climate change and biodiversity loss, driven in large part by unsustainable production and consumption, urgent action is needed. We need to preserve the Planet Earth for our children and grandchildren.\nGreen energy is one of the measures that need to be developed globally. I am proud to say that Lithuania is firmly on the green course since 2010. My country is among the leaders in the development of renewable energy and is among five most ambitious countries in the European Union in terms of renewable energy targets for 2030. Those will be achieved by building interconnections with the Western European electricity system, converting district heating systems to use biomass, approving additional auctions for solar and wind generated electricity, and promoting prosumer policy.\nUnfortunately, safe and secure energy is not everyone\u2019s goal. In Lithuania\u2019s immediate neighborhood, unsafe nuclear energy has been chosen as a way forward without much thought about a clean and sustainable future. We see the new nuclear power plant in Belarus as a geopolitical project aimed at maintaining Russian sphere of influence. Built without proper risk assessment and necessary consultations just 40 kilometers from our capital city, it challenges regional nuclear and environmental safety, as well as the functioning of the Baltic States electricity systems and the overall security of whole Europe.\nNuclear accidents respect no borders. Even the best technology can fail, if an unsuitable location is chosen or the basic construction and operational requirements are not followed. Any irresponsible cost cutting might have disastrous effects.\nTherefore, Lithuania urges the international community to seek the implementation of the highest nuclear and environmental standards for all nuclear objects around the world. The global security depends on our efforts to ensure nuclear safety.\nMr. President,\nLet me stress that nothing in the global world comes without effort and difficulty. Be it a resolution of conflicts, ensuring peace and security, fight against poverty or climate change, securing education, social inclusion for all, or fighting global pandemics \u2014 in all cases we need reliable tools.\nWe need the eyes that see and the hearts that dare. We need to defend the powerless and to fight the impunity of the powerful. We need to uphold multilateralism and the rules-based international order at any cost.\nThere are no alternatives. There is no other way but to work together with ever stronger resolve. Let the renewed sense of international community guide us!\nThank you."

        "file_text": "Your Excellency, President of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly,\nYour Excellency, Secretary-General of the United Nations,\nDistinguished Heads of State and Government,\nEsteemed Delegates,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nRarely have the United Nations and multilateralism been tested as they are being tested during this year of the UN\u2019s 75th anniversary, the year where the world is grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRarely, has there been a more pressing time for creative thinking and innovation to respond to modern challenges.\nThe painful lessons learned since the outbreak of the pandemic underscores the urgent need for continued collective approaches.\nTo be effective, our joint efforts need to be coordinated and delivered through a revitalised and more inclusive multilateral system, comprising of the voices of all stakeholders, including the youth, civil society and the private sector to ensure a global all-of-society approach.\nI say revitalised because the existing set-up has, despite the lessons of past outbreaks of viruses, failed to respond adequately to COVID-19 with devastating consequences.\nSeychelles stepped up to the challenge despite being faced with an economy crippled by the collapse of tourism, our primary industry.\nWe introduced a series of unprecedented measures to save the lives of our people and mitigate the economic destruction,minimising unemployment and securing workers\u2019 incomes. To ensure an inclusive approach that factors in the specific needs of different stakeholders in Seychelles, we consulted with the private sector, trade unions, civil society and inter-faith organisations as required.\nWe were joined in this undertaking by the tourism businesses, a key driver of Seychelles\u2019 economy and who continue to play an instrumental role in drafting Seychelles\u2019 tourism comeback together with Government. However, everything Seychelles has done to date to minimise the impact of COVID-19 will not be sustainable in the longterm because of the depletion in our foreign exchange reserves.\nIt took us 44 years since Seychelles\u2019 independence to attain the quality of life we enjoyed before COVID-19, and just 4 months for COVID-19 to paralyse our tourism industry and with it much of our economy.\nWe foresee a 14 per cent budgetary deficit for this year instead of the 4 per cent surplus we projected before COVID-19. The Seychelles economy was set to grow by 3.9 per cent this year but will now end 2020 at -15.2 per cent.\nWe estimate it will take at least five years for Seychelles to return to where we were before COVID-19, assuming the world gets a vaccine that ensures the novel coronavirus is no longer a global public health threat.\nI turn to the multilateralism theme for this debate; a multilateralism which we recognise as crucial to a globally-coordinated response to COVID-19 and to us emerging from the pandemic more resilient, and hopefully, more compassionate.\nSIDS have made heroic efforts to shore up jobs as unemployment grows and provide social safety nets for our people in response to COVID-19 with the limited capacity and resources that we have.\nHowever, we cannot maintain these in the long term, often at the cost of worsening our debt burdens as part of a looming global debt crisis.\nThe shortage of effective global solutions for SIDS as the United Nations celebrates its 75th anniversary is alarming.The ultimate test of multilateralism lies in the way we assist vulnerable economies today, for it ultimately decides whether we attain the future we want.\nWe call on all relevant stakeholders to take immediate, substantial and tailored actions to allow us to manage the crisis and address its grave socio-economic impacts while preserving our development achievements and reinforcing our resilience to future shocks.\nSuch actions should include building capacity for small island developing states to cope with and recover from external shocks such as pandemics like COVID-19, other forms of disasters, and impacts of climate change.\nInternational financial institutions should re-examine their eligibility criteria to tailor SIDS\u2019 access to concessional financing to take into account our extreme vulnerability to economic, climate and now public health shocks that put us at particular risk and disadvantage.\nSeychelles backs AOSIS, the Alliance of Small Island States, in its call for a SIDS Compact, which caters for our specific and persistent constraints and vulnerabilities.\nSuch a compact will require the design of new, and enhancement of existing financial instruments to guide SIDS economies through the current crisis, create a responsive system where we maintain our gains, reinforce resilience to climate change and achieve sustainable development.\nThe massive global economic restructuring now underway presents the world with a unique opportunity to pursue a holistic and transformational approach to address the numerous escalating global crises we face while making the most efficient use of our resources.\nOur recovery efforts should aim to take us to a more sustainable and resilient future which requires a recognition that economic recovery depends on ecological health. Reviving economic activity should not be at the expense of environmental sustainability.\nOne of the jobs Seychelles has offered workers made redundant by COVID-19, for example, is the planting of hundreds of thousands of trees across our islands. This measure is in keeping with the call by the world\u2019s scientists to protect our natural environment at all costs. This is how we can restore planetary health and the balance between human and ecological wellbeing.\nWe cannot have a healthy recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic if we do not heal our poor relationship with our natural environment. As the saying goes human health depends on nature\u2019s health.\nWe understand this well in Seychelles where the two main pillars of our economy, tourism and fishing, depend on the state of our natural, and especially our ocean, environment.\nSo, on March 26 this year as the pandemic raged across the world, Seychelles went ahead and delivered on our 2012 Rio+20 commitment to protect 30 per cent of our giant exclusive economic zone of 1.34 million square kilometres by 2020.\nIt was a recognition that even while we dealt with a public health emergency, we cherished the importance of nature to our people\u2019s physical, economic and social wellbeing.\nWe should adopt a similar approach to climate action to maintain and increase climate ambition in the context of the pandemic and prevent a post-COVID rebound in greenhouse gas emissions.\nWhile the effects of climate breakdown will continue to impact us long after we\u2019ve dealt with the pandemic, COVID-19 presents a new opportunity to take action on climate change as countries make drastic changes to infrastructure, jobs and investment.\nAchieving the 1.5-degree Celsius goal remains critical if we are to leave no country behind.The drop in greenhouse gas emissions and improvement in air quality during the pandemic is only temporary, and research shows it will have a negligible impact on the climate crisis.\nWe do not know how long the COVID-19 pandemic will last, but we know we are heading towards a temperature increase of approximately 3 degrees Celsius if business continues as usual. This will have devastating consequences for us all, especially SIDS and other vulnerable countries.\nCOVID-19 is not the biggest global challenge of our time. Climate change is the number one threat to humanity.\nThe postponement of COP26 to November 2021 does not mean a postponement of climate action and of urgently-needed efforts to raise climate ambitions.\nSeychelles\u2019 updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) or climate pledge to the Paris Agreement will accordingly have a whole chapter on harnessing the ocean that surrounds our islands for nature-based climate action.\nSeychelles\u2019 NDC will champion blue carbon ecosystems such as mangroves and the vast expanses of seagrass meadows, which form part of our new marine protected areas.\nIt will enable us as a big ocean state to contribute to the global fight against climate change far more than when we relied solely on land-based actions.\nSeychelles\u2019 protection of nearly a third of our EEZ for ocean conservation, sustainability and climate action shows that countries\u2019 responses to the health and financial crisis caused by COVID19 do not need to be at the expense of nature and climate.\nSeychelles agrees that we need international solidarity and cooperation more than ever in the face of the worst human and economic crisis of our lifetime, a multilateralism that works for both developed and developing countries.\nMany argue that society is unwilling to make the behavioural changes necessary to address climate change effectively. Countries\u2019 responses to COVID-19 show otherwise; we have changed in previously unthinkable ways.\nWe must not lose sight of the fact that the stimulus packages aimed at rescuing economies from the coronavirus crisis will determine the shape of the global economy \u2014 a more financially stable, socially inclusive and low-carbon economy \u2014 for years to come.\nIf we are going to talk about a multilateralism that counts for everyone, it must deliver an equitable recovery that prioritises innovation, science, health, wellbeing, opportunity and a liveable environment for all countries and societies.\nThe future of multilateralism depends on a transformative global response to the COVID 19 pandemic.\nA transformation which will take us all, the most vulnerable countries and fragile economies included, into a more sustainable and resilient post-COVID world better equipped to meet the goals of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement on climate change, and for small island developing states.\nI thank you all."

        "file_text": "President of the General Assembly,\nSecretary-General,\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nFirst of all, Mr. President, we wish you every success at the seventy-fifth session of the General Assembly. You can count on Peru\u2019s firm support of the General Assembly in fulfilling your tasks in such a noble leadership role.\nIn such difficult times for humankind, on behalf of the Government and the people of Peru, let me convey our unequivocal solidarity and sympathy to the people who, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, have lost loved ones, relatives, friends and co-workers, and the front-line actors \u2014 doctors, nurses and police and military personnel \u2014 who have sacrificed everything, including their own lives. I also pay tribute to and am grateful for those who, far from their families, continue to fight every day to save lives at the risk of losing their own. And we reaffirm our commitment to continue in the joint and unrelenting effort to combat this unprecedented health crisis.\nThe severity and magnitude of the pandemic and the highly contagious and unknown nature of COVID-10 will not allow for anyone to be safe until we are all safe. I therefore encourage all of us to join the struggle in a concerted and effective manner by recognizing the vaccine and treatment against this virus as global public goods and ensuring timely and equitable access to the medicines and equipment needed to address the pandemic.\nIt is therefore urgent to reach global agreements on those basic goals. That will strengthen the foundation of the multilateral system and ensure that the commitment we made in 2015 to leave no one behind is fulfilled.\nMr. President,\nTwo and a half years ago I assumed the Presidency of Peru in accordance the Constitution after my predecessor submitted his resignation before the Congress of the Republic.\nSince then, the Peruvian people and my Government have faced together various crises. We have had to combat organized corruption to safeguard democratic governance, and now we are combating the unforeseen and devastating COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addressing the latter, our responses have been based on constitutional principles in strict respect for the law and fundamental rights, while taking into account the sense of urgency and the determination of the people.\nWe have been fighting the scourge of corruption head-on with a set of national reforms to transform the institutions in need of them. In order to support that effort and owing to the transnational nature of the scourge of corruption, together with the Heads of State and Government of countries in the hemisphere at the 2018 Summit of the Americas, we resolutely adopted the declaration, entitled \u201cLima Commitment: democratic governance against corruption\u201d to expand our obligations and strengthen cooperation on our continent.\nLikewise we have promoted together with Colombia and other friendly countries, the convening of a special session of the General Assembly against corruption to be held in June 2021. We advocate the adoption at that session of a clear and action- oriented political declaration that will make international judicial cooperation and assistance more effective, especially with regard to corruption involving large assets, which, among other measures, will encourage the criminalization of corruption in the private sector and among legal entities, among others.\nMr. President,\nAny serious governance crisis could be overcome within the constitutional framework by dissolving Congress and calling for elections within the time limits established by law so that citizens could renew their congressional representation in a democratic and transparent manner. Democracy and the separation of powers have been preserved and strengthened through this mechanism in my country.\nWith the same commitment to the rule of law, national general elections have been called for in April 2021. I will therefore complete my term within the time frame provided for in the Constitution and will hand over my Office to my successor on 28 July 2021 \u2014 the date on which Peru will celebrate the bicentennial of its independence.\nThe lessons learned from this crisis have led my Government to commit to dialogue under the Peru Pact \u2014 a democratic space for reflection within the National Agreement forum \u2014 to reach consensus among political actors and citizens on five specific issues that will promote a renewed governance agenda in view of our bicentennial of republican life: establishing a unified health system; guaranteeing quality education; promoting economic growth; reforming the justice administration systems; and combating poverty and extreme poverty.\nMr. President,\nAs it is aware of the historical social gaps and weaknesses in the health-care system, my Government was one of the first in the region to take robust measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. They have saved thousands of lives despite elevated and distressing rates of death and contagion, while allowing for reversing decades of shortfalls with regard to infrastructure and investment in public health. We have fought to contain the disease while, at the same time, strengthening our response capacity.\nSix months after the struggle began, the number of people who have been infected with and died from COVID-19 is beginning to drop sharply in Peru, and we are firmly committed to stay the course until the end.\nDespite Peru\u2019s macroeconomic strength, the pandemic has deepened inequalities and exposed structural weaknesses caused by the disruption. We are therefore implementing the largest economic containment and recovery plan in our Republic\u2019s history, as well as one of the largest in the region, with an investment equivalent to 20 per cent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP).\nThe plan includes bonds, subsidies, liquidity and tax relief measures to sustain family spending, as well as to safeguard employment and the payments chain, thereby benefiting 8.5 million homes and more than 700,000 businesses, 98 per cent of which are micro-, small- and medium-sized businesses.\nWe have also developed public spending measures to create work to produce and restore 1 million jobs. In addition, we are stepping up various infrastructure projects through Government-to-Government contracting.\nThose measures have been decisive in addressing COVID-19 and will support a rapid and safe recovery, with GDP growth estimated at 10 per cent in 2021 and a return to prepandemic levels in 2022.\nMr. President,\nIn addressing this multidimensional crisis, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development remains the road map, which guides our decisions to overcome challenges made more complex by the pandemic. Such is the case with regard to increasing levels of poverty.\nPeru maintains its commitment to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, as stated in the second Voluntary National Review presented here in July, in which we reported on the progress and difficulties in implementing the 2030 Agenda.\nMr. President,\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest global challenge that humankind has faced since the end of the Second World War. I am convinced that we must strengthen multilateralism through the United Nations (UN) and WHO, based on lessons learned. That will benefit global health governance and international cooperation to make universal health coverage a reality, as an objective of sustainable development.\nIn keeping with that commitment, Peru supports the COVAX Facility initiative, the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator Facilitation Council, the Vaccine Alliance (GAVI) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). We encourage competition in the areas of vaccine and treatment discovery, which will involve researchers, academics, Governments, the pharmaceutical industry, philanthropists, and volunteers, to yield results that will collectively benefit us as global public goods serving all of humankind.\nAs it is committed to democracy and respect for human rights, Peru will continue to make regional diplomatic efforts with other stakeholders to support the peaceful restoration of democracy and the rule of law in Venezuela, as the first step to overcoming the multidimensional crisis affecting the country. Through its political mechanisms, the United Nations can provide its extremely valuable humanitarian support to contribute to the political resolution of the regional crisis before it becomes a chronic issue, which no one wants to see, especially the Venezuelan people who are suffering from the crisis.\nMr. President,\nPeru is particularly vulnerable to climate change. That is why my Government adopted the Framework Law on Climate Change in 2018 and is committed to the national implementation of the Paris Agreement, establishing road maps for 91 adaptation measures and 62 mitigation measures.\nThe conservation and sustainable use of the Amazon is another priority for my country, including strengthening its resilience and adaptive capacity in addressing climate change and safeguarding the country\u2019s vast biological diversity.\nAccordingly, in December 2019, we promoted the presidential summit at which the Leticia Pact was signed, and, a few weeks ago, together with leaders of the Amazon, we adopted the regional plan of action, with an integral vision for combating deforestation and illegal activities, strengthening capacities and including indigenous peoples and local communities in its development.\nMr. President,\nAs a founding member of the United Nations, Peru has an unwavering commitment to the maintenance of international peace and security, which guided its recent and constructive membership in the Security Council for the period from 2018 to 2019. Accordingly, we support the Secretary-General\u2019s Action for Peacekeeping initiative and his call for a global ceasefire.\nOur commitment to the general and complete disarmament of weapons of mass destruction is equally strong. We are part of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons regime and a member of the major international regimes on conventional arms control and nuclear non-proliferation. We are in the process of ratifying the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, as we are convinced that the prohibition of nuclear weapons and tests remains a moral imperative for the planet and humankind.\nMr. President,\nLet me conclude on the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations by remembering Ambassador Javier Perez de Cuellar, an illustrious Peruvian, who left us in March. We are filled with pride that this emblem of international diplomacy served as Secretary-General of the Organization for two consecutive terms, which were characterized by a constructive thaw in bipolarity and the resolution of numerous conflicts.\nWe remember his calls for us to fulfil our obligations based on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and work collectively for the resolution of our differences. His Pilgrimage For Peace, the title of his memoirs of his leadership in the House, will continue to inspire all to promote peace, sustainable development, protection of the environment, safeguarding human rights and the international rules-based system.\nStrengthened multilateralism aimed at sustainable development \u2014 as we agreed in the 2030 Agenda \u2014 aimed at giving future generations a better world for all will certainly be the best tribute we will be able to pay him.\nMany thanks."

Mr. Antonio Guterres, Secretary General\nLadies and Gentlemen, Heads and Members of delegations,\nI wondered while preparing this statement what more could I tell you, after all that I have said in previous statements, about the perpetual tragedy and suffering being endured by my people \u2014 which the world is witness to daily \u2014 and about their legitimate aspirations \u2014 which are yet to be fulfilled \u2014 to freedom, independence and human dignity, as enjoyed by the peoples of the world.\nUntil when, ladies and gentlemen, will the question of Palestine remain without a just solution as enshrined in United Nations resolutions? Until when will the Palestinian people remain under Israeli occupation and will the question of millions of Palestine refugees remain without a just solution in accordance with what the United Nations has determined over 70 years ago?\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nThe Palestinian people have been present in their homeland, Palestine, the land of their ancestors, for over 6000 years, and they will continue living on this land, steadfast in the face of occupation, aggression and the disappointments and betrayals, until the fulfilment of their rights.\nDespite all they have endured and continue to endure, despite the unjust blockade that targets our national decision, we will not kneel or surrender and we will not deviate from our fundamental positions, and we shall overcome, God willing.\nWe have accepted the rule of international law and UN resolutions, and we have done so in spite of the historic injustice that we have borne from 1917 to the present day, and even though these resolutions only acknowledged as Palestinian the territories occupied in 1967. Yet, the Israeli occupying Power, with the support of the present US administration, wants to substitute this basis for a just solution with the US \u2018Deal of the Century\u2019 and the planned annexation of over 33% of the land of the State of Palestine, in addition to the annexation of occupied East Jerusalem, including Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. We have rejected this deal, as did the international community, as it contravenes international law and UN resolutions, which recognized, inter alia, the existence of the State of Palestine in 2012 as part of the international order.\nWe have always sought a just, comprehensive and lasting peace, and we have agreed to all the initiatives presented to us. I have personally dedicated my life to achieving this desired peace, notably since 1988, followed by the Madrid Conference and the Oslo Accords in 1993, and to this very day. We accepted and remained committed to the Arab Peace Initiative, as it provides for peace, security and coexistence once the occupation ends. We did all of this for peace.\nWhat did Israel, the occupying Power, do in return? It violated all agreements signed with us, undermined the two-State solution through its oppressive practices of killing and maiming, arrests, home demolitions, asphyxiating our economy, and systematically acting to alter the character and identity of occupied Jerusalem, attacking its Muslim and Christian holy sites, notably Al-Aqsa Mosque, and pursuing its settler colonialism on our land and against our people, ignoring the Arab Peace Initiative for peace and actively attempting now to kill another opportunity for peace through reckless unilateral measures.\nFinally, it announces normalization agreements with both the UAE and Bahrain, in violation of the Arab Peace Initiative, and the terms of reference of a comprehensive, lasting and just solution in accordance with international law. The Palestine Liberation Organization has not given a mandate to anyone to speak or negotiate on behalf of the Palestinian people and the only path to lasting, comprehensive and just peace in our region requires ending the occupation and securing the independence of the State of Palestine on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital.\nIn this regard, I call on the Secretary-General of the United Nations to undertake, in cooperation with the Quartet and the Security Council, preparations to convene an international conference with full authority and with the participation of all concerned parties, early next year, to engage in a genuine peace process, based on international law, UN resolutions and the relevant terms of reference, leading to an end the occupation and the achievement by the Palestinian people of their freedom and independence within their State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, on the 1967 borders, and resolving all final status issues, notably the question of the refugees, based on resolution 194.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nThose who believe the Palestinian people can coexist with the occupation or be subdued by pressure and diktats are under an illusion, as are those who are being misled to believe that they can circumvent our people, who bear this struggle and are its only address. Let everyone know there will be no peace, no security, no stability and no coexistence in our region while this occupation continues and a just, comprehensive solution to the question of Palestine, the core of the conflict, remains denied.\nIn Palestine, ladies and gentlemen, there is a living nation, creative, civilized, peace-loving, aspiring passionately to freedom. A nation that has been able \u2014 despite the occupation that besieges our lives \u2014 to build an active and modern society, that believes in democracy and the rule of law and has been able to preserve its national existence and identity despite all the political and philosophical differences between its diverse components. Here we are, despite all the obstacles that you know too well, preparing ourselves to hold parliamentary elections, followed by presidential elections, with the participation of all factions and political parties.\nWe will continue creating life and hope under the flag of national unity and democracy. We will continue resisting all attempts and plans to erase us, and we will secure our rightful and natural place among nations and exercise the rights granted to us by international legitimacy, including our right to resist this occupation in accordance with international law.\nWe will continue building the institutions of our State and consolidating them on the basis of the rule of law. We will continue combating international terrorism, as we have done for years past. We will remain faithful to peace, justice, human and national dignity under all circumstances.\nI salute the great Palestinian people that bravely pursues the struggle for freedom and independence. I salute our martyrs, prisoners and wounded. I salute Jerusalem and our people who remain steadfast in its holy sites. I salute our people in the besieged Gaza Strip. I salute our people in the refugee camps everywhere. I salute all those who stand with us and with our rights from all countries, nations and organizations.\nPeace be upon you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, Distinguished members of the General Assembly, Ladies and Gentlemen, Introduction\nOn behalf of the Government of Tuvalu, I congratulate you on your election as President of the 75th United Nations General Assembly. Tuvalu has full confidence in your leadership. Let me also take this opportunity to thank the president of our 74th session, Professor Mohammed-Bande for a successful session under his leadership, despite the challengesto the work of the general assembly due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nI also want to express Tuvalu\u2019s solidarity with all countries in the fight against the covid19 pandemic.\nMr. President,\nTheme of UNGA75: Multilateralism\nWe acknowledge the international cooperation and solidarity that is underway to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. My country has benefitted from these assistances and I wish to thank our bilateral and multilateral development partners who are continuing to help us through these difficult times.\nThe social and economic impacts of the pandemic will be felt for many years to come. Recovering will be a long and costly process, especially for the most vulnerable. Global solidarity, effective international cooperation and political commitment are critical to sustain our response to recover and to build back better.\nWe therefore congratulate you for the priority you have given to multilateralism in the theme of our 75th UNGA, \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism \u2014 confronting the COVID-19 through effective multilateral action\u201d.\nMr. President,\nThe COVID19 Challenge\nThe advent of COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated our social and economic vulnerabilities and costs of development as a SIDS and an LDC. It came at the time when my country was still trying to recover from the aftermaths of tropical cyclone Tino in January and tropical cyclone Harold in April of this year.\nWhile Tuvalu is still COVID-19 free, the ripple effects of this deadliest virus has come at a huge cost to our economy. Unemployment in our fisheries and tourism sectors has soared and remittances dropped significantly. Food security was affected as supply chains were disrupted. We have to reallocate domestic resources to roll out economic stimulus assistance and limited social protection payments.\nConcretizing the Multilateral response in a UN we need and a future we want.\nCentral to our global recovery is a vaccine to save lives and stop transmission. We acknowledged the important work on developing a vaccine for the covid19 and welcome the efforts to ensure that it is available and affordable to the most vulnerable. In this respect I applaud the important work by the COVAX Facility Advance Market Commitment to accelerate the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines and to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in the world.\nCOVID-19 has significantly disrupted economies and societies right across the world. Indeed, COVID-19 has reshaped the contours of the normal way of things, placing us on a \u201cnew normal\u201d. Therefore, we must not only think outside the box, but we must also work outside the box. The UN members must work collaboratively together to build back better countries and economies that:\n(i)\tare inclusive and leave no one behind;\n(ii)\tprotect the health and wellbeing of all;\n(iii)\tpreserve our natural and marine environment;\n(iv)\tare low emissions and climate smart; and\n(v)\tbuild our resilience to future crisis\nMr. President,\nOur United Nations has in place systems and processes that should and can place us well to face both health and economic crisis. We have the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development and the SDGs. We have the Paris Agreement. We have the SAMOA Pathway for SIDS. We have the Istanbul Plan of Action for LDCs. We have the resources and the technology that we need. But it requires strong political commitment and immediate and ambitious action.\nAs we enter the Decade of Action, the world is off tracked to achieving the SDGs by 2030. We need to recommit ourselves to these mandates and build a genuine and durable partnerships we need to achieve them.\nThe digital economy is essential to support transformation to sustainable development. Many countries are yet to realise the full economic potential of a digital economy which in many ways will ensure the development and self-sufficiency of people at all levels.\nAt the centre of our development is people. Substantial advances in human capacity are needed through improvements of education and healthcare. This should result in productive societies with higher income and better standard of living.\nResponsible consumption and production will allow us to do more with fewer resources. We need to adopt a circular economy approach and reduce demand on depleting global resources.\nWhile COVID-19 is our immediate crisis, climate change remained the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the Pacific and its peoples in the long run. Pacific Islands Forum Leaders last year reaffirmed this commitment in the Kainaki II Declaration for Urgent Climate Change Action Now. The shared prosperity and security of our Blue Pacific can only safely exist if the international community pursues efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C.\nThe transformation and investment response to the COVID-19 pandemic must also serve to build our resilience to the impacts of climate change. If we failed this, then we are putting additional debt into our already exhausted capacities, which can further exacerbate climate crises going forward.\nDecarbonization remains central to our effort to combat the impacts of climate change, and help build the resilient of small and vulnerable economies and societies. We need clean and affordable energy for all through energy efficiency, more renewables and electrification. The Paris Agreement\u2019s 2020 commitments to update NDCs and to develop low emissions development strategies remain critical. They should be synergized with covid19 recovery efforts that accelerate transition to decarbonization and build resilience.\nInvesting in building resilience to natural disaster is important for our region. In 2019, our Pacific Islands Forum Leaders endorsed the establishment of the Pacific Resilience Facility whose purpose is to finance small disasters resilience projects in our local communities. The facility will be initially capitalized by donor funding after which the fund will be self-sustained providing small grants to fund projectsto enhance resilience. The facility replicates the number of successful national trust funds in some of our Pacific Island countries. The facility invites interested development partners to contribute to and to form the basis of development partnership on resilient building with our pacific region.\nCOVID-19 exposed the vulnerability of our food security systems. For atoll nations like Tuvalu, agriculture is difficult with rising sea levels. For the last few years, with the assistance of our development partners, we have invested on new agricultural food production systems that are more resilient to climate change and sea level rise. We acknowledge the recent work of the Peacebuilding Fund in this area and would encourage further assistance to scale up of this initiative to develop food security on atoll nations.\nAccess to grant financing and debt relief initiatives are crucial aspect of overcoming poverty and fulfillment of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. It is critical to provide fiscal space for the LDCs and SIDS to recover from the pandemic.\nMr. President,\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is a global problem that needs a global response. We believed that we need a UN that is networked, inclusive, with effective multilateralism that would aid efforts for a recovery and the continued implementation of the SDGs.\nIt is regrettable however that the Republic of China (Taiwan), with its exemplary response to the pandemic continues to be kept out of the UN system. Taiwan has managed the pandemic well and has reached a level comparable to OECD countries on several SDG indicators. Taiwan is in a much better position than most to help the international community build back better.\nTuvalu strongly supports the ROC\u2019s readmission into the UN as a founding member of the UN, and its active participation in UN specialized agencies including the WHO and ICAO.\nIt is also regrettable that the people of Cuba continued to face the economic burden of the long unilateral economic embargo. Keeping these measures in place robbed Cuba of the international collaborations and assistance to recover and build back better. It neglected the human rights and the spirit of cooperation espoused in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nMr. President,\nTuvalu remains committed to multilateralism. Working together as a global family with the full respect of human rights, together we can build a future that is responsive and resilient to health, economic and environment crises.\nI thank you Mr. President\nTUVALU MO TEATUA"

        "file_text": "Mr. Secretary-General,\nExcellencies,\nDistinguished delegates,\nThis year we commemorate the 75th anniversary of the United Nations in both dramatic and critical time.\nThe greatest challenge of our age \u2014 the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 continues to cause deep suffering among the people around the world and has seriously affected the global economy.\nIn the wake of this unprecedented human tragedy, on behalf of my country- fellows I extend the profound gratitude to all medical professionals and frontline staff-members who work very hard to protect us.\nThe current global emergency is a stress test for all of us that has triggered health, humanitarian and socio-economic turbulence. COVID-19 has exposed our past mistakes and failures.\nWe have witnessed a critical collapse of global cooperation in response to this crisis, trade protectionism and political nationalism, coming close to what some have already called a state of \u201cglobal dysfunction\u201d.\nThe whole world is on the verge of dramatic upheavals that may lead to irreversible consequences. Lack of mutual confidence, misunderstanding of international competition, trade wars and sanctions really undermine the prospects and hopes for a better world.\nLet us be frank \u2014 in the post-Cold War world we largely missed the chance to build a truly just, people-centered international system. The fate of our future generations depends on the understanding of this reality, primarily by us, the leaders of states.\nTherefore, it is our moral obligation to reflect on the paradigm of building a \u201cNew World\u201d. Now we are in a make-or-break moment for the humankind. Born a century before the UN establishment, a great Kazakh poet and philosopher Abai proposed his own formula on global interaction: \u201c\u0410\u0434\u0430\u043c\u0437\u0430\u0442\u049b\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u043a\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043a: \u0441\u04af\u0439\u043c\u0435\u043a, \u0441\u0435\u0437\u0431\u0435\u043a, \u043a\u0435\u0439\u0456\u043c\u0435\u043a, \u049b\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0435\u0442 \u049b\u044b\u043b\u043c\u0430\u049b, \u0436\u04af\u0433\u0456\u0440\u043c\u0435\u043a, \u0430\u049b\u044b\u043b\u043c\u0435\u043d \u043e\u0439\u043b\u0430\u043f \u0441\u04e9\u0439\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043a\u201d. Which means: \u201cAll that the humanity needs \u2014 love, compassion, bold actions, deeds and thoughtfulness\u201d.\nIn this context, allow me to share some points on our collective response to current challenges.\nMr. President,\nRight after the coronavirus outbreak, the UN\u2019s various funds, programmes and agencies have stepped forward to combat the crisis. However, the international\ncommunity obviously needs to do more. Firstly, to build a strong global health system priority must be given to upgrading national health institutions through timely and coordinated support from developed countries and UN agencies.\nSecondly, we must take the politics out of the vaccine. It is not too late for reaching a COVID-19 vaccine trade and investment agreement that would protect global production and supply chains.\nThirdly, it may be necessary to revise the International Health Regulations to increase the World Health Organization\u2019s capacity, and to develop national capabilities in preventing and responding to diseases.\nFourthly, we suggest that the idea of a network of Regional Centers for Disease Control and Biosafety under the UN auspices be closely examined. Kazakhstan stands ready to host such a regional center.\nLast but not least, in light of the global pandemic, launching of a biological weapons control system is becoming more acute than ever. Kazakhstan proposes to establish a special multilateral body \u2014 the International Agency for Biological Safety \u2014 based on the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention and accountable to the UN Security Council.\nDistinguished delegates,\nWe need urgent concerted efforts for a truly global economic recovery. I join the Secretary-General\u2019s call on rescue package amounting to 10 per cent of the world economy and share his view that the response to the pandemic should be based on a New Global Deal to create equal and broader opportunities for all.\nWe believe that the suspension of debt repayments by the poorest countries will help reduce uncertainty. International financial institutions need to implement innovative solutions like debt-to-health system swaps.\nI hope that the upcoming High-Level Meeting on Financing for Development will produce concrete measures.\nLandlocked developing countries have been particularly hard-hit by COVID-19 which has severely damaged trade and supply chains.\nAs the current Chair of the LLDC Group, Kazakhstan has proposed a UN Roadmap to reinvigorate implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action. The highest expectation of our people is practical deliverables within Agenda 2030.\nWe need prompt and well- coordinated steps to get back on track for an accelerated SDG Decade of Action \u2014 probably the most critical decade of our generation.\nThe very basic target, zero hunger is to be provided unconditionally. In this context, we note the importance of convening a Food Systems Summit in 2021.\nThe Islamic Organization for Food Security, initiated by Kazakhstan is ready to assist the international humanitarian campaign through the creation of food reserves.\nWe should renew our commitment to leave no one behind, especially women, youth, children, elders, persons with disabilities, disproportionately affected by the crisis.\nThe largest disruption of education systems in history should be stopped from becoming a generational catastrophe.\nCivic engagement and private sector involvement are also critical for solving current pressing problems.\nDuring past months we have witnessed strong solidarity all over the world through volunteering.\nTo acknowledge the role of volunteers, I propose the United Nations to proclaim an International Year of Mobilizing Volunteers for Development. In Kazakhstan I announced the current year as a Year of Volunteers.\nMr. President,\nThere are two more crises that are looming right behind the pandemic. One of them is the nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament crisis. Kazakhstan has been the role model of a responsible state by willingly abandoning its nuclear arsenal and shutting down world\u2019s biggest nuclear test site.\nHowever, continuous erosion of the non-proliferation regime leaves us in a dangerous position.\nKazakhstan, therefore, expects all Member States to join its appeal to nuclear powers to take necessary and urgent measures to save the humankind from a nuclear disaster.\nIn this respect we appreciate an active role played by relevant UN institutions including the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization.\nWe believe that legally-binding negative security assurances should be given to every non-nuclear-weapon state. That is why we urge all P5 countries to ratify the respective Protocols to the Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone Treaties, including Semipalatinsk Treaty.\nAnother existential crisis for our civilization is the climate change. It is not only a dangerous problem in itself, but is also a \u201cthreat multiplier\u201d. The climate emergency is a race we are losing. But the post-COVID recovery gives us unique opportunity to put environmental protection at the forefront of international agenda. We must unite around the UN\u2019s six climate positive actions.\nKazakhstan is very vulnerable to the various effects of the climate change. The tragedies of Aral Sea and Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site, the rapid melting of glaciers, and desertification threaten not only Kazakhstan and Central Asian region, but also the entire world.\nAlthough Kazakhstan is highly dependent on fossil fuels and has a long way to go to meet Paris 2030 targets, our commitment to develop a decarbonized economy has no alternative.\nWe will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 15 per cent by 2030 through economic overhaul and industrial modernization.\nAnd yet, in next five years we will plant more than two billion trees. To address these global crises, we need to restore an atmosphere of trust between Member States and strengthen multilateral institutions. Lack of trust between nations has become toxic for international relations.\nIt is a moral duty to demonstrate our commitment to the basic purposes and principles of the UN Charter.\nDue to the immensely growing demand for confidence-building, Kazakhstan aims to transform Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia into a full-fledged organization for security and development in Asia.\nThe world community should increasingly promote an ideology of tolerance, mutual understanding and cultural diversity. It is a key to countering hatred and intolerance.\nWe once again stress the need for creating a unified coalition to counter another global challenge \u2014 international terrorism.\nWe invite all countries to join the Code of Conduct for Achieving a World Free of Terrorism.\nKazakhstan was among the first to repatriate our women and children from war-torn Syria and Iraq. It was not an easy decision, but absolutely necessary one.\nIt is our strong belief that the United Nations must lead the global effort to overcome the pandemic, accelerate recovery and improve prospects for global governance.\nTherefore, each and every UN agency should reinstate its efficiency and relevance to the tasks ahead of us.\nWe have no alternative but to live up to the great challenge of building a more robust and forward-oriented UN.\nThe criticism of the United Nations is not always fair. The UN does exactly as much as the political will of the Member States allows.\nExcellencies,\nThough different, each of these three crises is in fact a governance challenge. To achieve truly just and people-centered world, measures at the international stage should be accompanied by the dedicated efforts at the national level.\nKazakhstan is determined to build an economically strong, democratically advanced and human-oriented \u201cListening State\u201d. Therefore, we conduct political and economic reforms that are expected to give a boost to the development of our society to meet up the expectations of our people.\nWe have decriminalized defamation, adopted new laws on political parties and on the peaceful mass meetings.\nTo fulfill a fundamental right to life and human dignity we decided to join the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on the abolition of the death penalty.\nAnother priority is ensuring equal opportunities for women and youth, protection of children.\nWe have reduced our Gender Inequality Index value by two times and have introduced a mandatory 30% quota for women and youth in election party lists.\nWe have helped 4.5 million fellow-citizens who temporarily lost their income during pandemic having allocated for this goal $1.1 billion. Over a million people have received food and household packages. It was an unprecedented measure in our part of the world.\nRegional cooperation has always been our main focus and commitment. Central Asia is undergoing rapid transformation through significant expansion of regional cooperation in various fields.\nNo doubt that a prosperous, strong and united Central Asia is beneficial both for regional and global stakeholders.\nAs to regional stability, the rational use of transboundary water resources is instrumental. We thus propose the establishment of a Regional water and energy consortium.\nTo coordinate development agenda in the region we intend to institutionalize a UN-led regional SDGs Center in Almaty.\nMr. President,\nWe must remember that in crisis comes an opportunity. We can build back for a better, greener, more efficient, fair and inclusive world. The emphasis must be shifted on the root causes, preventive measures, and increasing the efficiency of our limited resources.\nAll the efforts should be guided by the moral imperative \u2014 to Put People First.\nKazakhstan will always remain a strong supporter of the UN and will actively participate in fulfilling our collective aspiration for a better and happier future.\nThank you for your attention."

        "file_text": "The Kingdom\u2019s Statement in the UN General Assembly 75th Session\nYour Majesties, Your Highnesses, Your Excellencies, Mr. President of the General Assembly, Mr. Secretary General\nDistinguished Attendees,\nMay God\u2019s peace be upon you,\nAt the outset, I would like to extend my sincerest congratulations to Mr. Volkan Bozkir for having been elected President of the 75th session of UN General Assembly, wishing him success in fulfilling his duties.\nI also would like to extend my thanks to his predecessor Dr. Tijjani Muhammad- Bande, president of the previous session for the great efforts he exerted. I also would like to note and commend the distinguished work undertaken by the Secretary General Mr. Antonio Guterres to improve the performance of the UN institutions in a manner that achieves its objectives and meets the purpose of its charter.\nDistinguished Attendees,\nToday, I speak to you from the birthplace of Islam; the home of its revelation, and the Qibla for Muslims. I share with you a message in which we rely on the teachings of our noble religion, our Arab culture, and our common human values, which call for coexistence, peace, moderation, and solidarity among the nations and peoples of the world to confront the extraordinary challenges to humanity.\nToday, the world is facing a tremendous challenge in the form of COVID-19 pandemic and its health, humanitarian, and economic repercussions which compel all of us to stand together in order to face the common challenges to our world. As president of the G20, the Kingdom has coordinated international efforts by holding a Leaders\u2019 summit last March to coordinate the global efforts to combat this pandemic and curb its humanitarian and economic impacts. During the summit, the Kingdom announced its pledge of $500 million to support the efforts of combating the pandemic, and reinforce emergency preparedness and responses. The Kingdom continues to promote global response efforts to confront this pandemic and address its repercussions.\nThe Kingdom is one of the largest donors in the field of humanitarian and developmental aid. The Kingdom provides this support to the peoples of the world irrespective of their political, ethnic, or religious affiliation. During the past three decades, the Kingdom provided more than $86 billion in humanitarian aid benefiting 81 countries.\nDistinguished Attendees,\nMy country, ever since the foundation of this organization, has been in the forefront among the nations working to achieve international peace and security. It has been consistently working to mediate and reach peaceful solutions to disputes, as well as seeking to prevent conflict and support security, stability, development, and prosperity.\nHowever, the Middle East has been afflicted with major security and political challenges that undermine the security of its peoples and the stability of its countries.\nOur region has been suffering for many decades by attempts of the forces of extremism and chaos which seek to impose their malign views and policies in order to hijack these countries\u2019 present and future, paying no heed to the aspirations of the peoples of the region for development, prosperity, and peace. In the Kingdom, we chose a path for the future through our Vision 2030 which aspires to create a robust economy and a community which interacts with its surrounding and contributes actively to the progress and civilization of humankind.\nIn its regional and international spheres, the Kingdom advocates a policy that relies on respect for international laws and principles, and continues working to achieve security, stability, and prosperity in its region, while supporting political solutions to conflicts and combating extremism in all of its forms and manifestations.\nDistinguished Attendees,\nThe Kingdom\u2019s hands were extended to Iran in peace with a positive and open attitude over the past decades, but to no avail. The Kingdom received several of Iran\u2019s presidents and other senior officials, among the Kingdom\u2019s efforts to seek ways to build relations based on good neighborliness and mutual respect. The Kingdom welcomed the international efforts to deal with Iran\u2019s nuclear program, but time and again, the entire world witnessed how the Iranian regime exploited these efforts in order to intensify its expansionist activities, create its terrorist networks, and use terrorism, and in the process squandering the resources and wealth of the Iranian people for the purpose of its expansionist projects which produced nothing but chaos, extremism, and sectarianism.\nThe Iranian regime, in line with its hostile attitude, targeted oil facilities in the Kingdom last year in blatant violation of international laws. By doing so, it assaulted international peace and security and proved its disregard for the stability of the global economy and the security of oil supplies to the international markets. The Iranian regime also continues, through its surrogates, to target the Kingdom, launching, to date, over 300 ballistic missiles and more than 400 armed drones (UAVs) in a stark violation to UNSC resolutions 2216 (2015) and 2231 (2015). Our experience with the Iranian regime has taught us that partial solutions and appeasement did not stop its threats to international peace and security. A comprehensive solution and a firm international position are required to ensure fundamental solutions to the Iranian regime\u2019s attempt to obtain weapons of mass destruction, and its ballistic missile program, and its interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and its sponsorship of terrorism.\nDistinguished Attendees,\nThe Iranian regime interfered in Yemen by supporting the coup carried out by its surrogate, the Houthi militia, against the legitimate government. This has led to a political, economic, and humanitarian crisis from which the fraternal people of Yemen are suffering. This coup is a threat to the security of the countries of the region and the sea lanes vital to the global economy. Furthermore, the Houthi militias impeded the flow of humanitarian aid to the Yemeni people. They also obstructed the efforts to reach a political solution in Yemen and rejected efforts to deescalate the situation, the latest of which was the ceasefire announcement made by the Coalition to Support Legitimacy in Yemen last April in response to the UN\u2019s request, and in order to allow the efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in Yemen to proceed. Instead, they continue to target civilians in Yemen and in the Kingdom.\nThe Kingdom will not hesitate to defend its national security, nor will it abandon the fraternal people of Yemen until they regain their complete sovereignty and independence from Iranian hegemony. The Kingdom will continue to provide humanitarian support for the people of Yemen, and it will continue to support the efforts of the UN Secretary General\u2019s Special Envoy for Yemen in accord with the GCC Initiative, the outcomes of the Comprehensive Yemeni National Dialogue, and UNSC resolution 2216.\nDistinguished Attendees,\nTerrorism and extremist ideology pose a major threat to the entire world. Together, we have made remarkable progress in the past few years in combating extremist organizations, including substantially rolling back ISIS strongholds in Iraq and Syria through the efforts of the global coalition. Similarly, the forces of the Coalition to Support Legitimacy in Yemen were able to deliver important strikes against Al-Qaeda and ISIS in Yemen.\nTo achieve success in our battle against terrorism and extremism, we must intensify our joint efforts by facing this challenge comprehensively. This includes combating the financing of terrorism and extremism. The Kingdom has supported many international entities that contribute to reinforcing the joint efforts to combat this challenge. The Kingdom supported the UN Counter-Terrorism Center with a contribution of $110 million and established the Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology (Etidal) in Riyadh. The Kingdom also hosts the International Terrorist Financing Targeting Center.\nDistinguished Attendees,\nWe in the Kingdom, due to our position in the Muslim World, bear a special and historical responsibility to protect our tolerant Islamic faith from attempts by terrorist organizations and extremist groups to pervert it. Islam that equates the killing of an individual with the killing of all people is undoubtedly innocent of all the crimes and atrocities committed in its name by the forces of terrorism and extremism.\nThe terrorist and extremist organizations find fertile ground to sprout and spread in countries where there are sectarian divisions and weakness or collapse of state institutions. If we intend to win in our battle against terrorism, we must not waiver in facing the countries that sponsor terrorism and sectarianism, and we must stand firmly in the face of these countries that promote transnational extremist ideologies, which rely on false political slogans to hide their extremist, chaotic, and destructive nature.\nDistinguished Attendees,\nPeace in the Middle East is our strategic option. Our duty is to spare no effort to work together towards achieving a bright future where peace, stability, prosperity, and coexistence among all the region\u2019s peoples prevail. The Kingdom supports all efforts to advance the peace process. The Kingdom introduced peace initiatives since 1981. The 2002 Arab Peace Initiative provides the basis for a comprehensive and just solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict that ensures that the fraternal Palestinian people obtain their legitimate rights, at the forefront of which is establishing their independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital. We support the efforts of the current U.S. administration to achieve peace in the Middle East by bringing the Palestinians and the Israelis to the negotiation table to reach a fair and comprehensive agreement.\nWhile we follow with concern the developments in Libya, and while we call all of our Libyan brothers to sit at the negotiation table and unite to preserve the territorial integrity and safety of Libya, we condemn the foreign interventions in Libya. We also support a peaceful solution in Syria that maintains its territorial integrity and call for the departure of militias and mercenaries from it.\nWe also stand by the fraternal people of Lebanon who are experiencing a humanitarian catastrophe as a result of the explosion at the Port of Beirut, which occurred as a result of the hegemony of Hizbollah, a terrorist organization affiliated with Iran, over the decision making process in Lebanon by force of arms. This led to disabling the constitutional state institutions in Lebanon. In order for the fraternal people of Lebanon to achieve their aspirations of security, stability, and prosperity, this terrorist organization must be disarmed.\nMr. President, Distinguished Attendees,\nFrom this podium we call for the intensification of global efforts to confront the great challenges facing humanity in the areas of climate change, poverty, organized crime, the spread of epidemics, and other challenges which require that we strengthen our cooperation to work for a bright future so generations to come may live in stability, peace, and security.\nMay God\u2019s peace be upon you.\nThank you Mr. President."

        "file_text": "Mr President, Secretary-General, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and\nGentlemen,\nLet me congratulate Mr. Volkan Bozkir for the election as the President of the seventy-fifth session of the General Assembly. You can count on Finland\u2019s support, as you lead this important body during these exceptional times.\nAnd the times are exceptional indeed. At the start of this year, nobody could have foreseen that we are not able to gather in New York this September. The COVID-19 pandemic has hit all of us hard. Extending around the globe, it is affecting every continent and state, all people, and all areas of life.\nA pandemic is by definition a global challenge. It requires a global response. No country is able to combat this common enemy alone. No one is safe, until all are safe.\nAn effective global response can only come from all of us together. From the United Nations. I would like to reiterate our unwavering support for the UN system in general, and the World Health Organization in particular, for their efforts to manage the fight against the pandemic. I also would like to express my appreciation for the strong leadership Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has shown during this crisis.\nMr. President,\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over, it has already taught us a number of important lessons. Firstly, it has shown that we have to take health security much more seriously. Before the next pandemic emerges, we need better prevention and better preparedness. In this work, the Global Health Security Agenda can provide the WHO with valuable support.\nSecondly, it has unfortunately revealed how we are tempted to react to immediate threats \u2014 nationally, not internationally. When this pandemic broke out, our initial reaction was not to unite behind multilateral efforts. Instead of a much- needed global response, we witnessed a series of national responses. Faced with a completely new situation, this may have been understandable. But it does raise concerns on how we will be able to combat other global challenges.\nThirdly, however, and this is more encouraging: the past six months have also proven our capability to radical measures when needed. In order to contain the pandemic, governments, societies and individuals were suddenly prepared to change their behavior. As soon as the magnitude of the threat was perceived, unconventional solutions were sought.\nThis gives us hope. Where there is a will, there is a way.\nWe must not lose sight of the even more persistent existential threat to humanity. Climate change. Our lives may have been on lockdown this year, but climate change has not stopped for a moment. The urgency of bold and swift climate action is growing by the day. Our commitments to the Paris Agreement must prevail. We must redouble our efforts for their implementation.\nWe must make a virtue out of necessity. As the entire world now needs a recovery strategy, we have to make sure that we choose a road towards a sustainable future. Instead of returning to our unsustainable habits, we truly have to \u201cBuild Back Better and Greener\u201d. The Secretary-General\u2019s six principles for \u201cBuilding Back Better\u201d have our full support. All recovery measures must be assessed from the perspective of their climate and environment impacts. The Paris Agreement, the 2030 Agenda and the Convention on Biological Diversity need to guide our way forward.\nFinland is ready to do its share. The Finnish Government stands firmly behind its aim to make Finland climate neutral by 2035, and thus the world's first fossil-free welfare society. We will continue to integrate sustainable development into our state budget. We are determined to transform Finland into a socially, economically and ecologically sustainable society during this decade.\nAnd we continue to work actively in international partnerships. The Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action, led by Finland and Chile, has grown to include more than 50 countries. This cooperation helps countries to integrate climate considerations into economic, fiscal and financial policies.\nMr President,\nPrecisely when the demand for global solutions is rising, our ability to provide them is weakening. Multilateralism suffers from inward-looking nationalism and great-power competition alike. The institutions we have built together over decades are under growing pressure. International agreements, norms and principles are increasingly challenged and interpreted in ways which weaken both their potential and their legitimacy. Ultimately, if respect for the commonly agreed rules disappears, there will be not much left of a rules-based order.\nWe need to reverse this trend. More than ever, we need effective multilateral cooperation. More than ever, we need the United Nations. It is not only the common responsibility of all of us \u2014 the member states \u2014 to make it stronger. It should be obvious that it is our common interest, too.\nIt is equally obvious that all international institutions need to adapt to changing circumstances. New actors and new technologies create new kinds of challenges. Old structures and old instruments alone will not be sufficient to respond to them. But discarding existing frameworks would create a dangerous vacuum.\nNuclear weapons are becoming a particularly worrying example. With one agreement after the other lapsing, we soon risk losing even the last elements of nuclear arms control. It would be of fundamental importance for the nuclear weapons states to find a way to build mutual understanding and trust. Also in this regard, we support the idea of a closer dialogue between the permanent members of the Security Council. And it does not stop at arms control. At the end of the day, the entire UN system cannot function unless the P5 countries are able to work together.\nExcellencies,\nAs any global crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, too, can have negative effects on peace and security across the world. It can intensify existing conflicts, stall peace processes and wake up dormant tensions. But it can also offer opportunities for peace. The Secretary-General\u2019s call for a global ceasefire was a strong appeal for conflict parties to lay down their weapons. And as this year marks the 20th anniversary of resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security, we should further emphasize an inclusive approach to peacebuilding.\nIn addition to conflict resolution, we must invest more in conflict prevention. Every conflict avoided is one conflict less to be resolved in the future. Finland advocates the use of mediation for both purposes. We are ready and willing to offer our good services in this regard. Finland also remains committed to the peacekeeping operations and special political missions of the UN.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nFor the rules-based order, the rule of law is essential. All steps towards its consolidation in international relations have meant progress for humanity. Silence and looking away only empower perpetrators and let them escape justice. We need to end impunity for the gravest crimes. This should apply to all, including the strong and the powerful.\nNo government should use the crisis as a pretext to violate human rights or to limit democratic and civic space. No government should adopt measures that undermine the respect of the rule of law and of international commitments.\nThe Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the most progressive document ever on the rights of women and girls, was adopted twenty-five years ago. Unfortunately, this anniversary is not the only reason why it is so topical this year. The pandemic has hit women particularly hard.\nThe harsh economic and social implications for women have reversed the progress achieved during the last decades. The attempts to undermine women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights, especially sexual and reproductive health and rights, continue.\nIn order to get back on the right track, we must live up to the commitments we have made. In addition to the Beijing Declaration, this also applies to the Istanbul Convention, a ground-breaking legal instrument addressing violence against women.\nFor Finland, advancing women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights and gender equality is of fundamental importance. In the Generation Equality process, Finland has a leading role in bridging the digital divide between genders.\nIn the broad value base of Finland\u2019s foreign and security policy, human rights are at the forefront. This, and our long-term commitment to promoting human rights, is why my country is seeking a seat at the Human Rights Council from 2022 to 2024.\nSecretary-General, Mr. President,\nAt 75 years of age, the Charter of the United Nations remains a remarkable blueprint for the future \u2014 for a more peaceful, more sustainable and more just world. But the promise comes with an important condition.\nIn its Article 2, the Charter states: \u201cAll Members, in order to ensure to all of them the rights and benefits resulting from membership, shall fulfil in good faith the obligations assumed by them\u201d.\nAs much as our environment has changed over time, this principle continues to be true. Only fulfilled obligations lead to rights and benefits. Pacta sunt servanda. Agreements must be kept."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nMr. Secretary-General,\nEsteemed Colleagues,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nIt is a great honor to have this opportunity to address you and share what our country, Georgia, has to say looking back at the past year.\nThis year, the United Nations is celebrating its 75th anniversary and, for the first time in its history, the General Assembly is being held remotely. This format is unusual and, one might even say, historic because the reason behind it unites us all: today, the whole world is fighting against a common invisible enemy, the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHuman lives, irrespective of the region or level of living, are facing a common threat and the fight against this threat has eclipsed some of the challenges that have been on the UN agenda for decades; though, in some cases, it has brought some of the problems further to the fore.\nAll of us, states of different capacities, have found ourselves facing a completely new and more complex challenge.\nDespite the difficulties, we have succeeded in dealing with the onslaught of the pandemic in Georgia, as seen and unanimously acknowledged by the whole world. Thanks to proactive decisions in the fight against COVID-19, the selfless efforts of the authorities, doctors and epidemiologists, and, most importantly, our citizens\u2019 high social responsibility, as well as correct management, we have kept Georgia on the list of green zones. I am proud that despite the pandemic, the 112th Session of the Executive Council of the World Tourism Organization was held in our country just a few days ago. I would like to thank our friend countries \u2014 the United States, the European Union, and international financial institutions whose assistance proved to be of paramount importance in tackling the first wave of the pandemic.\nOf course, the calamity is still here and the virus continues to attack us but the knowledge accumulated by us allows us to manage the situation consistently and share Georgia\u2019s successful experience with everyone.\nBeyond this new challenge, for years Georgia has been facing a different, even more difficult one: the occupation of our territories.\nIt is universally known that in 2008, Russia carried out open, large-scale military aggression against Georgia, containing which became possible as a result of the unwavering support of the international community, primarily the United States and the European Union.\nHere, at the UN Headquarters, everyone is well aware that 20 per cent of Georgia\u2019s integral territories \u2014 Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali Region \u2014 are occupied by Russia.\nEven today, as the whole world wages war on the coronavirus pandemic, the Russian Federation continues the process of illegal borderization and provocations in the occupied territories; hybrid warfare tools are being used extensively, including disinformation attacks on the main facility of the national infrastructure for pandemic control \u2014 the Richard Lugar Center for Public Health Research.\nUnfortunately, Russia has yet to fulfill the August 12, 2008 Ceasefire Agreement brokered by the European Union; it continues to disregard Georgia\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty and the fundamental norms and principles of international law.\nWith illegal military training exercises and borderization, the installation of barbed wire fences and other artificial barriers, the occupation is taking a heavy toll primarily on the conflict-affected population, which is in a state of humanitarian crisis: they are deprived of access to their own homes and lands, forced to live in a reality in which passages are closed and families are further torn apart on a daily basis, with their freedom of movement, property rights, education rights, and access to basic medical services taken away. Local residents have been kidnapped, tortured, and killed.\nWe must remind you the names of our fellow citizens: Giga Otkhozoria, Archil Tatunashvili, and Davit Basharuli, whose lives were cut short by representatives of the occupation regime.\nGeorgia will never accept occupation!\nOn behalf of every Georgian citizen, I call on the international community to adequately assess Russia\u2019s illegal actions so that we, through our joint efforts, may force it to comply with international norms and fulfill assumed obligations, including the August 12 agreement. We urge Russia to adopt a constructive position within the framework of the Geneva International Discussions, where, with the participation of the UN, OSCE, the European Union, and the United States of America, we discuss the security and humanitarian issues related to Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali Region, such as Russia\u2019s non-use of force against Georgia, the withdrawal of troops, the creation of international security mechanisms, and the return of IDPs and refugees to their homes.\nFor their part, Georgia\u2019s authorities are sparing no effort to assist their fellow citizens in need as much as it is possible, even under the conditions of closed occupation lines.\nThe policy chosen by the Government of Georgia seeks to achieve peace through dialogue and resolve the conflict peacefully. This involves ensuring the implementation of the 12 August 2008 Ceasefire Agreement on the one hand, and reconciliation, confidence-building, and restoration of relations between the war- torn communities on the other.\nThe Georgian Government\u2019s peace initiative A Step to a Better Future clearly demonstrates that Georgia is interested in dialogue with the residents of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali regions. We are concerned about their fate, and we take an interest in improving the social and economic conditions on the ground, as well as in restoring direct ties between the communities on either side of the boundary line. Our goal is to develop said regions and improve the living conditions of their residents, to share with them every benefit and achievement available to us, including life in a peaceful, free, democratic, and corruption-free society as well as the opportunities offered by our ever closer relations with the European Union, such as free trade and visa-free travel.\nI address our fellow citizens on the other side of the occupation lines: Georgia is willing and able to share all this with you. Together, we can secure a better future for you and your children, while also preserving the unique culture and identity constituting our common heritage.\nAt this point, I would like to express deep gratitude to all our partners and friends for continuously standing by our side, for supporting Georgia\u2019s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the policy of non-recognition.\nIt is important to us that just a few weeks ago, under the conditions of the global pandemic, an unprecedented number of countries voiced support for the humanitarian resolution initiated by Georgia and 54 states concerning the status of internally displaced persons and refugees from Abkhazia, Georgia, and the Tskhinvali region/South Ossetia, Georgia, which confirms their right to a dignified return to their ancestral homes.\nColleagues,\nThe Georgian nation is a strong and freedom-loving one. Georgia has an ancient history, and our country is a future-oriented democracy. Today, Georgia is positioning itself in the world as a country with one of the highest democratic standards in the region, and one that is never complacent with achievements and always strives for development. We have always been \u2014 and remain to this day \u2014 a nation committed to Western values, which naturally harmonized Western and Eastern cultures and civilizations on Georgian soil.\nWe have implemented a historic constitutional reform resulting in Georgia\u2019s switchover to European parliamentary governance in 2020, and the parliamentary elections scheduled for 2024 will be held in line with a fully proportional electoral system. Said constitutional amendment will create a brand new analogue characteristic of Western parliamentary democratic systems, which will further accelerate our country\u2019s democratic development. With these changes, the ruling political team has succeeded in what many political forces have declared throughout our state\u2019s 30-year-long history but have never actually dared to implement.\nThe Georgian Government does and will do everything to ensure a free, impartial, transparent, and democratic environment for these crucially important elections amid the pandemic, where all Georgian citizens will have the opportunity to express their political will freely, against the backdrop of maximal attendance from international observers.\nColleagues,\nGeorgia is part of European civilization, which is why the path of our country\u2019s development remains unchanged, aiming at European and Euro-Atlantic integration, which is enshrined in the country\u2019s Constitution and is not subject to revision. Georgia has signed an Association Agreement with the European Union, with visa-free travel and a Free Trade Agreement also being in force. All this enables us to strengthen our European institutions, develop highest standard infrastructure, empower small and medium-sized businesses, foster the adoption of modern technologies, and stand by Europe in dealing with challenges.\nGeorgia has been participating in international peacekeeping missions in various countries for years. Our soldiers are steadfastly keeping guard over global peace and stability. The Georgian Armed Forces are exemplary in the fulfillment of their duties at all locations. Thirty-two of them have fallen while accomplishing this honorable and difficult mission.\nToday, we are an important player in ensuring global security as Georgia\u2019s security is inseparable from global security; therefore, our contribution to the strengthening of EuroAtlantic security is directly reflected on the strength and protection of our country.\nColleagues,\nGeorgia\u2019s transformation into a developed economy is our main goal, and we boast some impressive achievements on this path. For the time being, however, we are focused on leading our country out of the pandemic-induced global economic crisis as quickly as possible and with minimal losses. Our hopes in this regard are nourished by the fact that Georgia is a land of new opportunities, a place capable of offering that which is not offered elsewhere, including its strategic location with cultural and linguistic barriers simply nonexistent, with minimal taxes and every opportunity present for business development. Georgia holds one of the leading positions in the world in terms of the ease of doing business.\nGeorgia is presently positioned as a multifunctional regional hub of education, medicine, logistics, tourism, and business in general, yet we are not complacent and keep pressing on.\nToday, in the 21st century, we are introducing Georgia to the world as a gateway of progress, knowledge, and culture linking Europe to Asia and vice versa, a gateway with Western values that has stood for centuries on the crossroads of ancient civilizations.\nOur main value is the people, for whom tolerance \u2014 the core Western value \u2014 is an integral part of their identity.\nColleagues,\nUnfortunately, as we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, we continue to live in a world where the key principles of international law enshrined in the UN Charter are violated on a daily basis. Today, I would like to reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the UN Charter for the benefit of ensuring international peace and security.\nIt has been voiced repeatedly here that all UN member states are equal, and the pandemic has made this clear; it showed us that in the face of common adversity, we must unite and use the unique capabilities of each state. Unfortunately, COVID-19 is not the only international challenge. There are many others, such as armed conflicts, poverty, climate change, natural and technogenic disasters, terrorism and international crime, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and many others.\nGeorgia\u2019s millennia-old history has taught us the importance of unity. Our country\u2019s coat of arms reads Strength is in Unity! And it is in this unity that we have been standing by our strategic partners over the years; this unity has enabled us to overcome the first wave of COVID-19, our invisible foe. And it is with this unity that we must defeat the global pandemic because no country can deal with this challenge on its own.\nOnly thus can we face our future generations \u2014 who will assess this period as one of the most difficult ones \u2014 with dignity.\nTherefore, we must find our strength and, despite the difficulties involved, turn this grave crisis into an opportunity for development.\nThank you very much!"

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nMr. Secretary-General,\nYour Majesties,\nExcellencies, Distinguished Heads of State and Government, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nOn behalf of my delegation, I bring you warm greetings from the people of The Gambia on the occasion of the 75th Anniversary of the founding of United Nations (UN), which unfortunately coincides with the global COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we convey our sincere condolences to all those who have lost loved ones to the pandemic.\nMr. President,\nWe welcome the theme for the 75th Session of the UNGA: \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism \u2014 confronting Covid-19 through effective multilateral action\u201d.\nAs humankind, our future is closely linked, and the Covid-19 global pandemic has made this evident. It demonstrates the wisdom and need to craft collective strategies, approaches and solutions to mitigate global challenges.\nMr. President,\nThe need is pressing to defend our multilateral institutions by taking legitimate action on issues brought to the attention of the UN. It will result to establishing and maintaining peace and cooperation in a tranquil world order.\nMr. President,\nTo achieve this goal, space must be created to adequately and justly address the concerns and interests of all Member States. For small States like The Gambia, the UN has always provided a platform for negotiation, discussion, cooperation and collaboration for collective global action. Therefore, we reaffirm our commitment to the Charter and Principles of the United Nations.\nMr. President,\nThe Charter has empowered institutions to deal with all forms of crises, such as the outbreak of the pandemic, which threatens our existence. Earnestly, the response to the pandemic must equal the magnitude of the challenge. The devastation is already immense in terms of loss of human lives, economic loss and its social and emotional impact on nations, communities and individuals. A multilateral solution stands to be the surest path to safety and recovery for all of us.\nMr. President,\nHealthcare systems across the world are struggling to cope with the crisis, compelling many nations, including The Gambia, to adopt unusual measures that require huge and varied resources.\nWe admit, however, that our efforts have been significantly boosted by support from international friends and partners, such as the UN, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the European Union and bilateral friends.\nThis underscores the importance and relevance of international cooperation and solidarity in the search for solutions to global challenges.\nMr. President,\nSmall and developing nations have been struggling to manage their debt burdens, while trying to develop their economies. The outbreak of the pandemic has reversed our gains, with low revenue earnings and high public expenditure becoming the norm.\nThe Gambia\u2019s economy has shrunk to 2 per cent of GDP, and it continues to contract. Our tourism sector, which is a major employer and foreign exchange earner, is devastated, and unemployment is increasing rapidly.\nIn this complex situation, my Government has, with the support of partners, instituted social protection programmes to ease the adverse impact on our people. These interventions are not sustainable without external support.\nImplementation of our National Development Plan, 2018-2021 has been hampered by the pandemic. As the UN Decade of Action for the implementation of Agenda 2030 has been undermined by the outbreak of the pandemic, it is essential and most urgent to accelerate the implementation of our global commitments on Financing for Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\nMr. President,\nDeveloping countries, such as The Gambia, will continue to require support packages or bailouts from the United Nations and the international community in order to survive the ongoing economic decline.\nIn this light, The Gambia reiterates the strong call by the African Union for debt relief or debt cancellation, enhanced access to global finance, reduction of transaction costs on remittances and increased global solidarity and partnership.\nWe hope that the unique circumstances and challenges of the Least Developed Countries, especially countries in transition like The Gambia, will be accorded special and speedy consideration.\nMr. President,\nAside from the economies, it is quite urgent to rebuild and strengthen our weak healthcare systems and infrastructure and, through humanitarian action, the shattered and broken lives and homes.\nThis is an opportunity also to overhaul national health care systems and the international health and disease surveillance systems to make them better prepared for such pandemics.\nMr. President, we appreciate the role of the World Health Organization in guiding global healthcare action for all. Nonetheless, The Gambia craves for additional support to develop recovery strategies and programmes for the post-pandemic period.\nAs a country in transition, the pandemic is undermining the gains we made in restoring democracy and forging reconciliation and peace-building in the country. I assure the international community, however, that we are committed to all our transition tasks and programmes supported by the UN Peace-building Fund and the international community. We cherish your invaluable support, and urge for its continuation and expansion to help us nurture our democracy in a healthy environment.\nMr. President,\nWe equally applaud the frontline workers and scientific community for striving to save lives and to find a vaccine and cure for COVID-19. We hope that, if achieved, all safe and effective remedies will be made accessible and affordable to all.\nMr. President,\nThe pandemic has exposed and worsen the disadvantages of the digital divide in the world, especially in the field of education delivery.\nMillions of people around the world cannot access virtual classrooms due to the persistent inability to access the Internet.\nAccess to cyberspace has become the defining feature at work and in education. Through enhanced partnerships in the implementation of SDG 4, developing countries need support to overcome the digital gap, and create equal opportunities to access information and quality education, including vocational and ICT skills.\nMr. President,\nInsecurity continues to pose a serious challenge for countries of the Sahel. There are random attacks on communities, mass killings of innocent people and terrorist acts that displace populations with untold suffering and crises.\nWe acknowledge the efforts of the United Nations, the African Union, ECOWAS and other international partners to bring security and development to the region.\nThe implementation of the United Nations Integrated Strategy for the Sahel is important for maintaining lasting peace in the region. We commend UNOWAS, therefore, for its role in pacifying the region.\nMr. President,\nThe Gambia subscribes to the UN-AU Partnership on Peace and Security in Africa. In spite of its troubles, Africa contributes to global peace and security, thus deserving the support of the international community, particularly the UN. I assure this Body that The Gambia will continue to meet its commitments under the Secretary General\u2019s Action for Peacekeeping (A4P) Initiative.\nMr. President,\nThe international community must not relent in its efforts to restore peace and stability in Mali, Somalia, South Sudan, the Central African Republic and other trouble spots.\nI submit that The United Nations and regional organisations should do more to disrupt the activities of all armed terrorist and criminal networks. In addition, the African Union\u2019s efforts to silence the guns on the continent deserve continued international support for greater peace and stability on the African continent.\nMr. President,\nOn the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we call on the international community to take into account the Arab Peace Initiative, and undertake peaceful and genuine dialogue on a two-state solution.\nMr. President,\nWe endorse the work of the International Criminal Court, and call on the United States to revoke the sanctions imposed on the Court and its officials. Respect for the rule of law benefits all democratic states.\nFurthermore, we renew our interest in the case filed at the International Court of Justice on the plight of the Rohingya people in Myanmar. In this endeavour, we count on the support and efforts of the Organisation for Islamic Cooperation and all genuine partners to ensure that justice is served in Myanmar.\nMr. President,\nTo promote friendly relations between States, The Gambia calls for the normalisation of relations between Cuba and the United States. In the same vein, we fully endorse the one-China policy, and look forward to stronger, mutually beneficial international cooperation with the Peoples\u2019 Republic of China.\nMr. President,\nAs we celebrate seventy-five years of the existence of this democratic Organisation, it is a paradox that Africa is still negotiating for representation on the Security Council. Yet, much of its agenda affect the African continent. Certainly, Africa\u2019s voice on the Council will build confidence and reinforce the legitimacy of its decisions.\nMr. President,\nWe put on record our unwavering support for your Presidency during the 75th session of UNGA, and look forward to your strong leadership in these unusual and challenging times.\nAlso, we express profound gratitude to our Brother and Friend, Professor Tijjani Muhammad-Bande of Nigeria, and his excellent team for the excellent leadership skills and dynamism during his tenure as President.\nTo conclude, I wish all Members a happy and productive 75th Anniversary."

        "file_text": "I bid greetings to all the peoples of the world and express my solidarity with regard to the times we are all going through, which are of a momentous and historical scale and more challenging than we have ever experienced.\nThe pandemic has already claimed more than 1 million lives \u2014 millions of lost dreams, millions of people who are mourning the death of loved ones and millions of lives that will have forever been changed. We must continue working for them and prevent those numbers from increasing. God grant that my prayers be with them.\nThis turning point for humankind has significantly heightened our responsibility. The fate of generations will depend on the actions we take or fail to take in the days to come. And here we are in the General Assembly 75 years after the founding of the United Nations, one of humankind\u2019s great ideas.\nI thank all those listening to me, who could be doing something else with their time, which is a commodity that is becoming increasingly precious and scarce. I especially thank the Salvadorans both outside and inside our country for allowing me to be here me and work for them. And, above all, I thank God, as all that happens is because of Him.\nA year ago in the same General Assembly, I mentioned the urgent need for it to change its format and said that if it failed to do so, the Assembly would become irrelevant. Subsequently, the format of the General Assembly has changed slightly, but it has changed. The change was caused by a historic pandemic, but it has changed. What are the results of the change? The Assembly has become even more irrelevant. This year it has become so irrelevant that its relevance has not even been discussed.\nFor the vast majority of the world\u2019s population, it is as if it did not exist. Not only do most people not watch these speeches, they do not even recall that the General Assembly exists. And depending on their age, some may be unaware that it ever existed. In order to test that theory, over the past several days, I asked people of every walk of life and age questions about the General Assembly. Most of them did not even know the Assembly was in session, and the minority of people, who did know, did not even know the theme or who was going to speak. If you do not believe the results of my experiment, ask the first person you see after watching this speech.\nI say this as a proponent of self-criticism, given the fact that, as President of El Salvador, I am a member of the General Assembly and, as a human being, I am a firm believer in the potential for this tool to do good.\nHowever, as I warned the General Assembly last year, the world has already changed and continues to change increasingly rapidly, and whoever fails to change runs the risk of disappearing. Today\u2019s world is very different from the world of just a few years ago. In no moment in recorded history, has society changed and continued to change to such an extent in such a short time.\nAnd what have we the General Assembly done? We merely send video-recorded statements, as we have been forced to make a change in response to the pandemic instead of a courageous change to build the future we want. That change alone is insufficient, and the world will continue to change, whether we do or not. To some, these word may sound harsh, but it is my high regard for the founding principles of the United Nations and the Assembly that compels me speak them.\nI want it to change so that it survives. I want it to change so that we as humankind can use this great tool. I want it to change so that all of us together have a hand in changing the world and our shared destiny, not only the General Assembly, which risks becoming irrelevant.\nAs the year comes to an end, we continue to reel from the effects of one of the greatest crises in the modern history of humankind. And what have we the United Nations done? Let us perform the same experiment once again: ask the first person you see what the United Nations has done during the pandemic. It is in this connection that I would like to thank the countries and organizations that have helped and continue to help us survive the crisis.\nI thank the Government and the people of the United States, who helped us transform a public system with 31 intensive care units into one with more than 1,000 multifunctional units, while sending us about 600 respirators, at a time when they were in short supply in the world.\nI also thank the State and the people of Japan, without whose help we would never have been able to establish the largest hospital of the region and one of the most advanced and largest hospitals to treat the coronavirus disease in the world. I will forever be grateful to and in deep admiration of the Government and the great people of Japan, who as a society exemplify giving service to the world.\nOn behalf of the people of El Salvador I also express my heartfelt thanks to all the countries, representatives of private enterprise and volunteers throughout the world who have helped and continue to help us. All the help has enabled us to continue saving thousands of lives, not only in terms of the pandemic, but also the future. Every life that we have saved and will save together represents generations saved \u2014 hundreds of thousands of future lives and stories that will have been preserved thanks to our recent action. I thank God for giving us the opportunity and everyone who has helped us to do that.\nSuch help, however, has mostly been bilateral work, not necessarily owing to the United Nations system. Despite the fact that it was established mainly to deal with events such as the current existential threat facing humankind, there has been a lack of leadership on the part of the Organization to unite the world to counter the virus together.\nBut crying over what could have been is counterproductive. We must see this as an opportunity and wake-up call so that we are prepared for a similar, or even more powerful, blow \u2014 the next global threat \u2014 and, more important, so that we take advantage of this unique historic opportunity to build and create our future.\nWhen I was a child \u2014 and I like to believe that it was not long ago \u2014 we thought about the future and our minds were carried away by the possibilities \u2014 flying cars and humans devoting their lives to the arts and humanities while robots would do the work that they did not want to do. The world we imagined speaks in a multifaced way to the future of humankind\u2019s collective consciousness in a multicultural world, free of war, channelling its efforts to explore the stars and place them within humankind\u2019s reach.\nWhat do young people imagine now, as they look towards the future? The answer is natural disasters, pandemics, wars, apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic scenarios and dystopian societies. If you do not believe me, try the experiment once again, and ask the first young person you see: How do you imagine planet Earth in the future?\nBut certain aspects of the future that many of us imagined as children are today realities. Technology has reached levels that even the most daring futurologists could not have imagined. Almost everyone listening to me has a supercomputer in their pocket. Moreover, your mother may be listening to me with such a supercomputer.\nAny smartphone today has millions of times more computing power than the supercomputer that took us to the moon. The latest iPhone is far more powerful than the supercomputer of the 1970s, 1980s and even 1990s. There are also billions of these supercomputers scattered throughout the globe, connected to one another by the largest network in human history.\nA year ago, in this Hall, I mentioned the potential of this network, and, since then, it has become much larger and more powerful. In a year, it will be even more so. How do we manage it? I believe that we have yet to understand its potential and the potential of all the tools we have available both individually and collectively to us through it.\nNever in human history have we had so many opportunities to be able to do what we want to do, be honest with ourselves and create what we want to create. This network allows us to instantly connect with the best minds anywhere in the world. This network enables us to connect with people with the same interests, aspirations and vision of the world. I am speaking from the individual\u2019s perspective. Imagine what we humankind can do.\nThere is something wrong with this world when millions of people have supercomputers in their pockets and the problems remain the same \u2014 historical problems like hunger, homelessness, deaths from curable diseases, which are all relatively easy for humankind to resolve. If the whole world decided to resolve every one of them, they would be solved in a matter of months or even sooner.\nWe have only marginally tested that ability to change the world in recent months. Yet the results have been incredible at both the international and local levels. We are seeing that in the race for a vaccine and collaboration involving treatments of the virus at the global level. In that regard, I very warmly thank the members of the Italian medical community, in particular, whose research led to the initial treatment that saved thousands of lives in El Salvador, not to mention the entire world, at their own great personal risk, at a time when we knew little about the virus. I thank them on behalf of the people of El Salvador. The applause of the world would fall short of justly singing their praise.\nAt the local level, in El Salvador we have seen how in a matter of months we have put an extremely precarious human health-care system on track to becoming a first-world system. Although progress remains to be made, we have realized that, if we try, we can achieve much more faster than we ever imagined. Every day that we fail to work together in order to solve the world and humankind\u2019s problems represents lives that will be lost forever. We will lose those opportunities forever.\nIn El Salvador, we are trying at the same time that we are cleaning house with regard to problems that lie ahead, but, thanks to God, we are seeing tangible results. With the help of friendly countries, we have succeeded in drastically lowering all insecurity indicators, including homicides, extortion and robberies, among others. In our Administration, we have saved an average of nine lives a day from being murdered \u2014 and nine families from mourning the death of a loved one. I thank God that we have achieved that much faster than we thought possible.\nI pray to God that this trend continues and that we will soon be able to transform El Salvador into one of the safest places in the continent \u2014 a country that, until only two years ago, many considered as the most insecure country in the world. Much remains to be done. There are several issues that we have to resolve, but if we use the tools that we humankind have created, we can accelerate the process that all developed countries have had to go through.\nWe are doing it. We are beginning to educate and build a new country. Our idea is to begin building a model society for the world, already embodied by several societies with their own particularities, as examples of what we can achieve as part of humankind. In advocating our vision of what can be accomplished as an interconnected society, I therefore call on all the thinkers and doers of the world who want to participate in the development and consolidation of a country to work with us to build the miracle sovereign State of El Salvador.\nEl Salvador is a country where the political will exists to take the leap that is so urgently needed by the General Assembly. In El Salvador, members will enjoy the availability of a Government with the desire, ideas and the mission of a forward-looking people striving to create their own future, while, at the same time, contributing to humankind \u2014 as well as excellent weather and waves every month of the year.\nWe are a country that is in the process of being built, which is extremely exciting, but we would like to speed up the process. That is why we are entreating the pioneers of the world to help us in both the public and private spheres in which we are almost completely connected throughout the world where with a few key strokes I can reach them in everywhere so that they can answer me, collaborate and build. That tool is there in order to move humankind at least a little bit in the right direction.\nWe are counting on the creative human imagination, which differentiates and will continue to differentiate us from other species. The human species will live thousands of years longer and always have something to invent. The possibilities of our \u2014humankind\u2019s \u2014 future are almost limitless. But we have to take control of our destiny. Humankind must always seek its path, and the purpose of certain pioneers is to ensure the consciousness and the courage to do so. If we unite and succeed in achieving that goal, we may even live to see ourselves as the architects of one of the golden ages in humankind\u2019s history.\nMay God enlighten us all and allow us to rebuild the future together as brothers.\nThank you very much."

        "file_text": "Mr President of the General Assembly,\nMr Secretary-General,\nDistinguished Heads of State and government,\nExcellencies,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nThere are moments that leave their mark for generations. The founding of the United Nations seventy-five years ago was one such moment. For this, we can be grateful to our parents.\nAre we nevertheless permitted to take a critical look at the UN today? \u2014 Yes, we are... We even have to.\nIn fact, seventy-five years on and there are still wars, there are more refugees and displaced people than ever before, there is a climate crisis currently without a solution, millions are going hungry and we haven\u2019t achieved gender equality.\nWe could criticise the UN for this \u2014 but who are we really talking about, when we blame \u201cthe UN\u201d? We are in fact talking about ourselves, because the UN is its Member States. And it is often Member States that stand in the way of the UN\u2019s work. They block decisions or refuse to implement them, undermine resolutions or flout their principles.\nThis weakens the UN. And it weakens all of us, too. If we want a strong UN, then we \u2014 Member States \u2014 must strongly support the organisation and work together to pursue its objectives. Because the goals of the UN are our goals.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nWe live in an era marked by geopolitical tensions. Many States are also increasingly polarised in their internal affairs.\nMore than ever, the UN is indispensable for the promotion of peace and security in the world. It embodies the causes of human rights, sustainable development and a world governed by the rule of law. We would do well to work together to achieve the goals of the UN because they benefit all of us and they make us stronger.\nMy country is proud to contribute to the achievement of the UN\u2019s goals, even if it is not always easy. It is difficult to translate the goals we have set ourselves - on climate or gender equality for example - into national policy. But that is why all of us politicians are elected: to offer our respective populations and humanity as a whole a decent life in freedom and security.\nMy country also advocates for an international order regulated by the rule of law. We are committed to international humanitarian law and to the prevention of conflicts, and we provide good offices wherever they are desired. My country is prepared to take on more responsibilities, which is why for the first time, Switzerland is a candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the period 2023-2024.\nSwitzerland of course wholeheartedly supports the Secretary General\u2019s appeal for a global ceasefire. But beyond such an appeal, is there anything else we can do?\nWe must put even more effort into preventing conflicts. Here too, human rights must remain at the centre of our action. \u201cInternational Geneva\u201d also contributes to conflict prevention, for example by hosting the Human Rights Council and the Arms Trade Treaty Secretariat.\nBy prosecuting the worst crimes, the International Criminal Court is contributing to uphold international humanitarian law. We reaffirm here our support for the International Criminal Court as an integral part of a rules-based international order. To facilitate debate on the best ways to adhere to these humanitarian norms, Switzerland was one of the first countries to publish a voluntary report on its national implementation. My country would welcome it if other countries followed.\nWhile it is right to try to prevent conflicts and to seek to mitigate their worst humanitarian consequences, it is also crucial to find lasting solutions to the conflicts that are ongoing. As the capital of peace, \u201cInternational Geneva\u201d contributes to this by providing a space for dialogue between the parties to a conflict.\nSwitzerland\u2019s peace policy draws on essential characteristics of my country\u2019s political culture, such as power-sharing, openness to dialogue, tolerance and consideration of everyone\u2019s interests. In the future, Switzerland intends to further step up its capacities and expertise in mediation and facilitation in order to support those who wish to end conflicts through dialogue.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nWhile \u201cInternational Geneva\u201d contributes to peace and security in the world, it is also the seat of the World Health Organization, which has played such a crucial role since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe current health crisis has caused untold suffering in the world. The most vulnerable have been hit hardest: the child in the overcrowded displacement camp; the single mother who has lost her job; the young adult whose job prospects have been destroyed; or elderly people and the sick, who are particularly at risk.\nMy country is coping with this pandemic as best it can.\nThe World Health Organization plays a central part in fighting the pandemic. As host state of the WHO and other international health organisations, Switzerland is committed to ensuring that they can take effective action. For this to happen, the WHO must have sufficient resources and the support of all of us to carry out its reforms. Is it fair to demand so much from this organisation when 80% of its funding comes from voluntary contributions?\nBeyond the necessary fight against the current pandemic, we must think now about the world that will emerge from this crisis and that cannot entirely be yesterday\u2019s. If every crisis is a suffering, it is also a moment of change that allows us to reinvent ourselves.\nSo let\u2019s reinvent ourselves, keeping in mind the goals we set for ourselves when the UN was created seventy-five years ago.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nThere are moments that leave their mark for generations. Such moments require decisive and courageous action. This is true today. From my country\u2019s perspective, the most urgent tasks are to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement, and to step up our efforts for peace.\nIt is up to us \u2014 the political representatives of our countries \u2014 to take the right decisions for the good of our fellow human beings and our planet. Let us assume this responsibility.\nLet us strengthen the UN\u2019s capacity to act, and ensure that the decisions we make today will be a source of pride for generations of tomorrow."

        "file_text": "Mr. Secretary General,\nMr. President,\nA global pandemic has changed everyday life drastically. From one day to the next, millions of people get infected and thousands die even when their life expectancy was longer thanks to development. Hospital systems with high-level services have collapsed and the health structures of poor countries are affected by their chronic lack of capacity. Drastic quarantines are turning the most populated cities into deserted areas. Social life is non existent except in the digital networks. Theaters, discos, galleries and even schools are closed or being readjusted.\nOur borders have been closed, our economies are shrinking and our reserves are dwindling. Life is experiencing a radical redesigning of age-old ways and uncertainty is replacing certainty. Even close friends cannot recognize each other due to the masks that protect us from the contagion. Everything is changing.\nLike finding a solution to the pandemic, it is already urgent to democratize this indispensable Organization so that it effectively meets the needs and aspirations of all peoples.\nThe sought-after right of humanity to live in peace and security, with justice and freedom, the basis for unity among nations, is constantly under threat.\nOver $1.9 trillion are being squandered today in a senseless arms race promoted by the aggressive and war-mongering policies of imperialism, whose leader is the present government of the US, which accounts for 38 per cent of the global military expenditure.\nWe are referring to a markedly aggressive and morally corrupt regime that despises and attacks multilateralism, uses financial blackmailing in its relations with UN system agencies and that, in a show of unprecedented overbearance, has withdrawn from the World Health Organization, UNESCO and the Human Rights Council.\nParadoxically, the country where the UN headquarters is located is also staying away from fundamental international treaties such as the Paris Agreement on Climate Change; it rejects the nuclear agreement with Iran reached by consensus; it promotes trade wars; it ends its commitment with international disarmament control instruments; it militarizes cyberspace; it expands coercion and unilateral sanctions against those who do not bend to its designs and sponsors the forcible overthrow of sovereign governments through non conventional war methods.\nAlong such line of action, which ignores the old principles of peaceful co-existence and respect of the right of others' to self-determination as the guarantee for peace, the Donald Trump administration it also manipulating, with subversive aims, cooperation in the sphere of democracy and human rights, while in its own territory there is an abundance of practically uncontrolled expressions of hatred, racism, police brutality and irregularities in the election system and as to the voting rights of citizens\nIt is urgent to reform the UN. This powerful organization, which emerged after the loss of millions of lives in two world wars and as a result of a world understanding of the importance of dialogue, negotiation, cooperation and international law, must not postpone any further its updating and democratization. Today's world needs the UN just as the one where it came into being did.\nSomething that is very special and profound has failed, as evidenced by the daily and permanent violation of the UN Charter principles, and by the ever- increasing use or threat of use of force in international relations.\nThere is no way to sustain any longer, as if it were natural and unshakable, an unequal, unjust and anti-democratic International order where selfishness prevails over solidarity and the mean interests of a powerful minority over the legitimate aspirations of millions of people.\nNotwithstanding the dissatisfactions and the demands for change that, together with other states and millions of citizens in the world, we are presenting to the UN, the Cuban Revolution shall always uphold the existence of the Organization, to which we owe the little but indispensable multilateralism that is surviving imperial overbearance.\nMore than once, at this very forum, Cuba has reiterated its willingness to cooperate with the democratization of the UN and the upholding of international cooperation, that can be saved only by it. As stated by the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba and Army General Raul Castro Ruz, and I quote: \u201cThe international community shall always count on Cuba's honest voice in the face of injustice, inequality, underdevelopment, discrimination and manipulation, and for the establishment of a more just and equitable international order which really centers on human beings, their dignity and wellbeing.\u201d End of quote.\nMr. President,\nComing back to the seriousness of the present situation, which many blame only on the COVID-19 pandemic, I think it is essential to say that its impact is by far overflowing the health sphere.\nDue to its nefarious sequels, impressive death toll and damages to the world economy and the deterioration of social development levels, the spreading of the pandemic in the last few months brings anguish and despair to leaders and citizens in practically all nations.\nBut the multidimensional crisis it has unleashed clearly shows the great mistake of the dehumanized policies fully imposed by the market dictatorship.\nToday, we are witnessing with sadness the disaster the world has been led to by the irrational and unsustainable production and consumption system of capitalism, decades of an unjust international order and the implementation of ruthless and rampant neoliberalism, which has widened inequalities and sacrificed the right of peoples to development.\nUnlike excluding neoliberalism, which puts aside and discards millions of human beings and condemns them to survive on the leftovers from the banquet of the richest one per cent, the COVID-19 virus does not discriminate between them, but its devastating economic and social effects shall be lethal among the most vulnerable and those with lower incomes, whether they live in the underdeveloped world or in the pockets of poverty of big industrial cities.\nAccording to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) projections, the 690 million people who were going hungry in 2019 might be joined by a further 130 million as a result of the economic recession caused by the pandemic. Studies by the International Labor Organization (ILO) say that over 305 million jobs have been lost and that more than 1.6 billion workers are having their livelihoods at stake.\nWe cannot face COVID-19, hunger, unemployment and the growing economic and social inequalities between individuals and countries as unrelated phenomena. There is an urgency to implement integrated policies that prioritize human beings and not economic profits or political advantages.\nIt would a crime to postpone decisions that are for yesterday and for today. It is imperative to promote solidarity and international cooperation to lessen the impact.\nOnly the UN, with its world membership, has the required authority and reach to resume the just struggle to write off the uncollectable foreign debt which, aggravated by the social and economic effects of the pandemic, is threatening the survival of the peoples of the South.\nMr. President,\nThe SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the early signs that it would bring a pandemic did not catch Cuba off guard.\nWith the decade-long experience of facing terrible epidemics, some of which were provoked deliberately as part of the permanent war against our political project, we immediately implemented a series of measures based on our main capabilities and strengths, namely, a well structured socialist state that cares for the health of its citizens, a highly-skilled human capital and a society with much people's involvement in its decision-making and problem solving processes.\nThe implementation of those measures, combined with the knowledge accrued for over 60 years of great efforts to create and expand a high-quality and universal health system, plus scientific research and development, has made it possible not only to preserve the right to health of all citizens, without exception, but also to be in a better position to face the pandemic.\nWe have been able to do it in spite of the harsh restrictions of the long economic, commercial and financial blockade being imposed by the US government, which has been brutally tightened in the last two years, even at these pandemic times, something that shows it is the essential component of the hostile US Cuba policy.\nThe aggressiveness of the blockade has reached a qualitatively higher level that further asserts its role as the real and determining impediment to the managing of the economy and the development of our country. The US government has intensified in particular its harassment of Cuban financial transactions and, beginning in 2019, it has been adopting measures that violate international law to deprive the Cuban people of the possibility to buy fuels they need for their everyday activities and for their development.\nSo as to damage and demonize the Cuban Revolution and others it defines as adversaries, the US has been publishing spurious lists having no legitimacy by which it abrogates itself the right to impose unilateral coercive measures and unfounded qualifications on the world.\nEvery week, that government issues statements against Cuba or imposes new restrictions. Paradoxically, however, it has refused to term as terrorist the attack that was carried out against the Cuban embassy in Washington on 30 April, 2020, when an individual armed with an assault rifle fired over 30 rounds against the diplomatic mission and later admitted to his intent to kill.\nWe denounce the double standards of the US government in the fight against terror and demand a public condemnation of that brutal attack.\nWe demand a cease of the hostility and slanderous campaign against the altruistic work by Cuba's international medical cooperation that, with much prestige and verifiable results, has contributed to saving hundreds of lives and lowering the impact of the disease in many countries. Prominent international figures and highly prestigious social organizations have acknowledged the humanistic work done by the \u201cHenry Reeve\u201d International Medical Brigade for Disaster Situations and Serious Epidemics and called for the Nobel Peace Prize to be given to them.\nWhile the US government is ignoring the call to combine efforts to fight the pandemic and it withdraws from the WHO, Cuba, in response to requests made to it, and guided by the profound solidarity and humanistic vocation of its people, is expanding its cooperation by sending over 3 700 cooperation workers distributed in 46 medical brigades to 39 countries and territories hit by COVID-19.\nIn this sense, we condemn the gangster blackmailing by the US to pressure the Pan-American Health Organization so as to make that regional agency a tool for its morbid aggression against our country. As usual, the force of truth shall do away with lies, and facts and protagonists shall go down in history as they should. Cuba's example shall prevail.\nOur dedicated health workers, the pride of a nation brought up in Jose Marti\u2019s idea that My Country Is Humanity, shall be awarded the prize their noble hearts deserve, or not; but it has been years since they won the recognition of the peoples blessed by their health work.\nThe US government is not hiding its intention to enforce new and harsher aggressive measures against Cuba in the next few months. We state once again before the international community that our people, who take pride in their history and are committed to the ideals and achievements of the Revolution, shall resist and overcome.\nThe attempts at imposing neocolonial domination on Our America by publicly declaring the present value of the Monroe Doctrine contravene the Proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace.\nWe wish to restate publicly in this virtual forum that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela shall always have the solidarity of Cuba in the face of attempts at destabilizing and subverting constitutional order and the civic-military unity and at destroying the work started by Commander Hugo Chavez Frias and continued by President Nicolas Maduro Moros to benefit the Venezuelan people.\nWe also reject US actions aimed at destabilizing the Republic of Nicaragua and ratify our invariable solidarity with its people and government led by Commander Daniel Ortega.\nWe state our solidarity with the Caribbean nations, which are demanding just reparations for the horrors of slavery and the slave trade, in a world where racial discrimination and the repression against Afro-descendant communities have been on the rise.\nWe reaffirm our historical commitment with the self determination and independence of the sisterly people of Puerto Rico.\nWe support the legitimate claim by Argentina to its sovereignty over the Malvinas, the South Sandwich and South Georgia islands.\nWe reiterate our commitment with peace in Colombia and the conviction that dialogue between the parties is the road to achieving stable and lasting peace in that country.\nWe support the search for a peaceful and negotiated solution to the situation imposed on Syria, with no foreign interference and in full respect of its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nWe demand a just solution to the conflict in the Middle East, which must include the real exercise by the Palestinian people of the inalienable right to build their own State within the borders prior to 1967 and with East Jerusalem as its capital. We reject Israel's attempts to annex more territories in the West Bank.\nWe state our solidarity with the Islamic Republic of Iran in the face of US aggressive escalation.\nWe reaffirm our invariable solidarity with the Sahrawi people.\nWe strongly condemn the unilateral and unjust sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\nWe restate our rejection of the intention to expand NATO's presence to the Russian borders and the imposition of unilateral and unjust sanctions against Russia.\nWe reject foreign interference into the internal affairs of the Republic of Belarus and reiterate our solidarity with the legitimate president of that country, Aleksandr Lukashenko, and the sisterly people of Belarus.\nWe condemn the interference into the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China and oppose any attempt to harm its territorial integrity and its sovereignty.\nMr. President,\nToday's disturbing circumstances have led to the fact that, for the first time in the 75-year-long history of the United Nations, we have had to meet in a non-presential format.\nCuba's scientific community, another source of pride for the nation that, since the triumph of the Revolution of the just, announced to the world its intention to be a country of men and women of science, is working non-stop on one of the first vaccines that are going through clinical trials in the world.\nIts creators and other researchers and experts, in coordination with the health system, are writing protocols on healthcare for infected persons, recovered patients and the risk population that have allowed us to keep epidemic statistics of around 80 per cent of infected persons saved and a mortality rate below the average in the Americas and the world.\n\u201cDoctors and not bombs.\u201d That was announced one day by the historical leader of the Cuban Revolution and chief sponsor of scientific development in Cuba: Commander in-Chief Fidel Castro Ruz. That's our motto. Saving lives and sharing what we are and have, no matter any sacrifice it takes; that is what we are offering to the world from the United Nations, to which we only request to be attuned with the gravity of the present time.\nWe are Cuba.\nLet us strive together to promote peace, solidarity and development.\nThank you very much.\n"

Mr. Isaias Afwerki.\nThe UN General Assembly is taking place this year at a critical juncture when the world is at a cross-roads on account of the vicious COVID-19 global pandemic that has inculcated an immense loss of life so far.\nAs it may be recalled, I had underlined the following salient points in my message to the UN General Assembly last year.\nIn as far as global trends is concerned, I had stated, and I quote, \u201cthe world is on the cusp of a new world order. All vital parameters indicate that the unipolar world order has come to an end or is in its twilight years. The economic power balance is inexorably changing, with a spike in attendant intense rivalries and upheavals\u201d.\nIn regard to Africa, my remarks were, and I quote, \u201cAfrica\u2019s lot over the past quarter of a century has been onerous. Africa\u2019s resources were plundered wantonly. Despite hollow phrases of \u2018conflict prevention\u2019 and \u2018conflict resolution\u2019, wars and upheavals continue to increase and fester. Almost 1 billion Africans remain marginalized through the collusion of external predators, their local surrogates and corrupt special-interest entities. This tragic reality requires utmost and urgent attention for effective remedies\u201d.\nIn terms of the situation in our neighbourhood \u2014 namely the Horn of Africa and Red Sea Region \u2014 the salient points underlined in my message of last year were:\n\u201cThe two regions have been immensely and inordinately afflicted in the past 25 years by externally instigated, intractable, internecine ethnic and clan conflicts, as well as discord and wars among neighbouring countries. This grim reality is in stark contrast to the promising events and hopes engendered in the early 1990s for regional integration. Here again, a large part of the blame falls on corrupt local actors.\u201d\nDistinguished Participants,\nAs we mull over current realities this year, what are the new, promising, tidings that we can invoke apart from the earnest pleas and petitions for higher efficacy that are emphasized solemnly almost every year.\nAlas, what is new in our world this year is the depressing calamity; the huge loss of life that COVID-19 has and continues to incur globally.\nAnd albeit its agonizing dimensions, the Pandemic has starkly exposed the structural flaws and deficiencies of the prevailing, precarious, economic and security \u201cglobal order\u201d. It has debunked the spurious explanations and narratives peddled in the past to embellish and rationalize a largely dysfunctional global order. Indeed, in a rather perverted sense, the Pandemic constitutes a wake-up call; a costly reminder for us to mend our ways.\nDistinguished Participants,\nThe pursuit and ideals of enduring global peace, stability and prosperity are squarely predicated, and can only flourish, on the edifice of a robust global organization that can measure up to all these challenges. This indelible fact is more evident than ever before. In the event, allow me to renew our call for the strengthening and revamping of the marginalized UN system whose authority and efficacy have been corroded in the past decades.\nI thank you"

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nThe Middle East is not exactly renowned for producing good news, and few expected this year to be any different. As you know, the pandemic virus is ravaging our part of the world, like everywhere else. But I am pleased to report to you that, this year, I can tell you about good news from the Middle East \u2014 in fact, I can report two pieces of good news.\nEarlier this month, at a White House ceremony hosted by President Trump, Israel signed historic agreements with the United Arab Emirates and the Kingdom of Bahrain. This was the first peace treaty between Israel and an Arab country in over a quarter of a century and it was the first time that peace agreements between Israel and two Arab countries were signed on the same day.\nThese new agreements will bring our peoples the blessings of peace and the enormous benefits that come with more trade, more investment, more commerce, transportation, tourism and increased cooperation in so many areas. I also have no doubt that more Arab and Muslim countries will be joining the circle of peace soon \u2014 very soon.\nThis good news about peace came about because of a clear break with the failed strategies of the past. For far too long, the Palestinians effectively wielded the veto on peace between Israel and the broader Arab world. For decades, all progress was halted and held hostage to completely unrealistic Palestinian demands, such as the demand that Israel withdraw to the indefensible lines of 1967 and place its security in the hands of others; or the demand that Israel expel tens of thousands of Jews from their homes, effectively committing ethnic cleansing; or the demand that Israel absorb millions of Palestinians or descendants of refugees from a war that was launched by the Palestinians against Israel more than half a century ago.\nOf course, these demands, along with many others, are complete non-starters for any responsible Israeli Government. Yet for years, many in the international community have tried to appease these absurd Palestinian demands and, as a result, they have wasted time trying to advance an illusion that will not happen instead of working for a realistic solution that could happen.\nThankfully, President Trump chose a different path to peace; a path anchored in reality. He recognized Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. He recognized Israel\u2019s sovereignty over the Golan Heights and he put forward a realistic peace plan that recognizes Israel\u2019s rights, addresses Israel\u2019s security needs and provides the Palestinians with a dignified, realistic path forward if they make peace with Israel.\nCritics argued that each of these steps by President Trump would kill the chances for peace. Well, they were wrong \u2014 dead wrong. Those steps advanced peace. Now two Arab States have decided to make peace with Israel and more will follow. The expanding circle of peace will not make an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians less likely; it will make peace between Israelis and Palestinians more likely. Palestinian leaders will increasingly realize that they no longer have a veto over peace and progress in our region and hopefully those leaders will ultimately decide to make peace with the Jewish State. And when that happens, Israel will be ready. I will be ready and I would be willing to negotiate, on the basis of the Trump plan, to end our conflict with the Palestinians once and for all.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nIsrael and States across the Arab world not only stand together in advancing peace; we stand together in confronting the greatest enemy of peace in the Middle East: Iran. Iran wantonly and repeatedly attacks its neighbours and its terror proxies are directly involved in violence throughout the Middle East, including in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Gaza and, of course, Lebanon.\nWe all saw the terrible explosion at Beirut port last month. The explosion happened here. This is the Beirut port. Two hundred people died. Thousands of people were injured and a quarter of a million people were made homeless.\nNow, here is where the next explosion could take place: right here. This is the Beirut neighbourhood of Janah. It is right next to the international airport. And here, Hezbollah is keeping a secret arms depot. The secret arms depot, right here, is adjacent, a metre away, from a gas company. These are gas canisters, right here. It is a few metres away from a gas station. It is 50 metres away from the gas company. Here are more gas trucks. And it is embedded in civilian housing here and civilian housing here. For the Janah neighbourhood residents these are the actual coordinates.\nSo, I want to show you the entrance to Hezbollah\u2019s missile factory, because that is what it is. It is right here. This is the gas company and this is the missile explosive depot.\nI say to the people of Janah: you have got to act now. You have got to protest this, because if this thing explodes it will be another tragedy.\nI say to the people of Lebanon: Israel means you no harm, but Iran does. Iran and Hezbollah have deliberately put you and your families in grave danger. And what you should make clear is what they have done is unacceptable. You should tell them: \u201cTear these depots down!\u201d\nJust a few days ago, one of these depots exploded at Ain Qana in south Lebanon. And that is why the international community must insist that Hezbollah stop using Lebanon and Lebanese civilians as human shields.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nWe must all stand up to Iran, and President Trump deserves praise for doing exactly that. First and foremost, I commend President Trump for withdrawing from the flawed nuclear deal with Iran. In 2015, I stood alone among world leaders in opposing the shameful nuclear deal that was made with Iran. I opposed it because the nuclear deal did not block Iran\u2019s path to the bomb \u2014 it actually paved its way to it. I opposed it because the deal\u2019s restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme were only temporary and were in no way tied to Iran\u2019s change of behaviour.\nNow Iran has violated even those temporary restrictions. Because of these violations, Iran will have enough enriched uranium in a few months for two nuclear bombs. And Iran has been working on a new generation of centrifuges. It is called the IR9, which will multiply Iran\u2019s enrichment capability fifty-fold.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nThere is no question that Iran is seeking nuclear weapons. The once-secret nuclear archive Israel\u2019s agents obtained from the heart of Tehran proves that beyond a shadow of a doubt. In the run up to the nuclear deal, Israel was told \u2014 especially by our European friends \u2014 that any Iranian violation would be met with a quick and severe response.\nBut in the face of Iran\u2019s brazen violations, in the face of the irrefutable evidence of the nuclear archive, the Security Council has done \u2014 well, absolutely nothing. Wedded to the failed nuclear deal, the Security Council also still refuses to see what was obvious to anyone who understands anything about the Middle East. Rather than curb Iran\u2019s aggression, the nuclear deal fed and funded it.\nFive years ago, in removing the sanctions on Iran, the leading Powers of the world opened the door of a tiger\u2019s cage and then they simply hoped for the best. But instead, exactly as I warned five years ago, we who live in the Middle East are suffering the consequences of that irresponsible deal.\nA richer and emboldened Iran use the billions that flowed into its coffers to fuel its campaign of carnage and conquest across the region while, thankfully, President Trump recognized the disastrous nuclear deal for what it was and he acted. He restored United States sanctions, forced countries to choose between doing business with America or doing business with Iran and took out the world\u2019s most dangerous terrorist, Qassem Suleimani. And last month, when the Security Council refused to extend an arms embargo on Iran, the United States snapped back the sanctions.\nWhile the Security Council is divided, we in the region are united. Both Arabs and Israelis are together urging for tough action on Iran. And when Arabs and Israelis agree, others should pay attention.\nIsrael calls upon all members of the Security Council to stand with the United States against Iran\u2019s aggression; stand with it in insisting that Iran and its nuclear weapons programme once and for all; stand with the United States in confronting the greatest danger to peace in our region. And if you do, I am confident that, in the years ahead, we will be able to celebrate more good news from the Middle East \u2014 good news for Israel, good news for our Arab neighbours and good news for the world and for all those who seek peace security and prosperity.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, Distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen a pleasant good afternoon.\nMr. President let me on behalf of the Government and people of St. Kitts and Nevis congratulate you on your election to the presidency of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. Our virtual convocation this year \u2014 the 75th anniversary of the United Nations \u2014 is testimony to the truly unusual times in which we live.\nI must also seize the opportunity to pay tribute to the Secretary General, Mr. Antonio Guterres for his leadership during this difficult period of COVID-19 pandemic. The theme of this debate is rather fitting for such a time like this! We must have faith in multilateralism and international cooperation if we are to achieve the sustainable development goals by 2030 and the stronger, safer future, we all want to see.\nSeventy-five years ago at the twilight of the Second World War, the world came together at another inflection point and pledged that, \u201cWe the peoples of the United Nations determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equality of rights of men and women and of nations large and small, and to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained, and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.\u201d\nSeventy-five years after, these objectives are still relevant and laudable. They remain a work in progress. This moment of global reckoning, a moment in which approximately 1 million of our brothers, sisters, friends, colleagues, neighbours and parents have perished to a punishing pandemic, demands a renewal of purpose and promise. That purpose must be fidelity to multilateralism and faith in international cooperation if we are to breathe new life into the United Nations charter while also achieving the sustainable development goals, halting climate change and pivoting to the stronger and safer future we all want to see \u2014 guided by the significant lessons of the distant and recent past.\nMr. President,\nThe year 2020 has taught us as a people, nation and indeed an interconnected world that the time for mutual reliance is upon us and that we need each other now more than ever if we are to rebuild and strengthen the socio-economic foundations laid bare from this two-fanged crisis. The time is now. We must show up! We must speak up! We must Share! We must Listen! We must Act and surely, we must Lead!\nMr. President,\nMultilateral Action\nWe are living in unprecedented times. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, has gripped the world like we have never seen before, destabilizing economies, overwhelming many healthcare sectors and causing incalculable pain and suffering on millions of people worldwide.\nWe commend the international community that has bound together in global solidarity to defeat the pandemic. I congratulate the World Health Organisation for its stewardship of the global response to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. We as CARICOM states reaffirm our support for the WHO framework \u201cAccess to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A). This global collaborative framework provides a solid global response to defeat the pandemic by the rapid development, scale up and equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics under pinned by the strengthening of our health systems. Instead of nationalism we need global cooperation in the fight to defeat COVID-19.\nWe commend the all of society approach that has worked so very well in the context of St Kitts and Nevis. Every stakeholder group has played their role in combating COVID-19 here. The World needs all Nations large and small to work together for mutual success.\nSt. Kitts and Nevis and COVID-19 Pandemic\nSt. Kitts and Nevis has been successful in containing the spread of the COVID-19 within its borders. Our twin island Federation has been fortunate to record a low infection rate, with zero deaths and have an R-value below 1. We have a success story to tell the World.\nThe implementation of a national response mechanism, comprising of the establishment of a national emergency coordination committee, closure of our borders to nonessential travel, the imposition of restrictions on the physical movement of people within our borders, as well as the promotion of protective wear and a robust public awareness campaign all played an exceptional role in our considerable success.\nCOVID-19 reminds us that our fight to eliminate non communicable diseases must be stepped up. People living with NCDs are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 and are amongst the most affected by the disease. Climate Change, NCDs and COVID-19 are inter-linked symptoms that something is awry with planet earth.\nMr. President,\nEconomic impact\nThe novel coronavirus disease has disrupted international travel and tourism, global supply chains, industrial and commercial operations and created widespread unemployment. This unprecedented situation will inevitably stymie our chances of achieving the sustainable development goals.\nFinancing for Development\nMultilateral assistance is essential for countries such as ours when faced with global challenges. Our fiscal resources are limited and have been severely tested in this particular instance. Now, the call for concessional financing is louder and stronger than ever before. Advanced countries and the international financial institutions must respond positively to the call for concessional resources if we are to reshape our economies for a post-COVID-19 world, and return to the path to sustainable growth and development.\nGiven our economic and environmental vulnerabilities as a small island developing state, we are likely to be confronted with the multiplier effect of the pandemic, particularly as we brace for the most intense segment of the Hurricane Season.\nClimate Change\nMr. President,\nSt Kitts and Nevis is the smallest independent nation in the western hemisphere and the impact of climate change weighs heavily on our daily lives. At this point in time, we are in the most active part of the hurricane season at the mercy of mother nature and for this reason climate change will always be high on our agenda. Climate change for us is not something to be postponed for tomorrow. It must be addressed like yesterday. We must regain the momentum and continue our work to consolidate the gains made.\nHigh-level Summit on Biodiversity\nMr. President,\nEarlier this month the UN warned that countries are set to miss critical targets to preserve and protect earth\u2019s biodiversity. This requires immediate and drastic action.\nWe are therefore pleased to advocate for Sustainable Development Goal 15, which calls for us to protect, restore and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss. I look forward to joining my SIDS colleagues at the High-level Summit on Biodiversity to champion the cause for us to protect our biodiversity not just on land but on our high seas.\nFor St Kitts and Nevis, the ocean is our lifeblood. Let us protect it, to preserve a stronger and safer future.\nFood Security\nThe Food Systems Summit to be held next year is timely, since our current inadequacies, as exposed by the pandemic, demand a vigorous examination of our strategies for food production and nutrition security. I am particularly encouraged by the positive response of Kittitians and Nevisians in answering the call of my Government to strengthen our food security by scaling up our investments in agriculture and fisheries.\n25th Anniversary of Fourth World Conference on Women\nMr. President,\nAs we continue to hail the contribution of women to the socio economic landscape of our country and the world at large, we are pleased to join in the commemoration of the 25th Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women next week. Earlier this year, we commenced our examination of the national implementation of the Beijing Declaration. The findings revealed that our Federation has much to celebrate regarding the advancement of women over the past 25 years; but there is still much ground yet to be covered, and many trails yet to be blazed.\nThrough the implementation of our National Gender Policy and other legislation and focused attention on Beijing Declaration\u2019s 12th Action Point \u2014 The Girl Child, we will continue to prioritise our pursuit of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls.\nGlobal Health Partnerships\nMr. President,\nSt Kitts and Nevis once again renews its call for Taiwan\u2019s inclusion in this international fraternity of Nations. The Republic of China (Taiwan) remains a valuable partner for peace, prosperity and development with the fullest respect for international law. Taiwan has stayed true to its longstanding traditions and has remained a true partner in in fight against COVID-19. We have seen first-hand Taiwan\u2019s exemplary management of the pandemic within its own borders and we have been impressed by its willingness to help vulnerable states around the world. Taiwan has assisted many states in combatting this unprecedented health pandemic by sending more than 51 Million surgical masks as well as other medical equipment to more than 80 countries. In our view, the international community has been deprived of the gift of true partnership offered by the 23.5 million people of Taiwan. My hope is that Taiwan can be included in the UN system, particularly the WHO \u2014 its meetings, mechanisms and activities thereby improving the global response and resources available to address transboundary crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The exclusion of Taiwan \u2014 its experience, expertise and resources, leaves a partial vacuum in the global response to COVID-19. The World Health Organisation can only benefit from the inclusion of such a worthy member. Equally, the existence of the antiquated embargo against Cuba flies against the spirit of global partnerships which we desire in the future. At this time more than ever vulnerable Nations must be free to access Cuba\u2019s expertise in health, and a myriad of other areas of global concern.\nMr. President,\nConclusion\nThis has been a very difficult year of, but it also must be the year we can recommit to the United Nations and its ideals. We must through comprehensive reforms make the UN system fit for purpose. We will have to look beyond antiquated frameworks and look to new socio-economic models and rely on global cooperation to build a better world. Global threats to people and the planet are multiplying and the United Nations, in its 75th year, must be resilient and innovative to help in this crisis and future crises. Strengthening global solidarity and cooperation is paramount for the U.N. The UN creates the perfect environment to marry collective action and solidarity with multilateralism. We welcome the UN 2020 future possibilities report which provides a good guide on how governments can make certain changes to their economies now. However, there must be much more dialogue and commitment if we are to experience real change.\nThe gravity of the pandemic has been laid out in several United Nations resolutions on COVID-19 and while we take action on them all in the General Assembly Hall, let us remember and commit to what they all about, while remembering at the same time that we all rise on the same tide!\nI thank you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President;\nExcellencies, Heads of State and Governments; Mr. Secretary-General;\nDistinguished Delegates;\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nIntroduction\nI have the great honour to deliver this address on behalf of the government and people of the Republic of Vanuatu.\nMr President,\nAt the outset, let me sincerely congratulate you on assuming the presidency of this 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly. Your Excellency, I assure you of Vanuatu\u2019s committed support during your tenure, and have every confidence that your presidency will successfully guide us in our collective pursuit of the future we want, and rally the spirit of cooperation essential for the United Nations we need.\nI would also like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to His Excellency Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, the outgoing President of the 74th Session on his outstanding stewardship of this august body during such a challenging time.\nGlobal Challenges\nMr. President,\nUsually, we would be gathered in the iconic General Assembly Hall to share our thoughts on the state of the world we share. The corridors, meeting rooms and side events would be abuzz with activity as leaders and delegates come together. In this time of uncertainty and peril, when we could most benefit from such gatherings, we cannot do so.\nDelivering our national address via video link may be emblematic of this extraordinary time, but it\u2019s also a sign of our resolve to adapt and make use of what is available. So, even though for the moment we are not all able to travel or be together in person, we can continue to find ways to harness our collective commitments with the vision of ending the pandemic and resetting our planet on a sustainable and peaceful footing.\nFor so many of our people around the world, 2020 has been a year of unparalleled challenge. COVID-19 has unleashed a complex web of health, economic and social issues that have sorely tested government, business and community systems. The pandemic has exposed existing vulnerabilities and alerted to us the threats of new ones. We have seen it exacerbate the already unacceptably high rates of global inequality and poverty that we face.\nWe have seen how it has most severely impacted the most vulnerable in our communities, especially women and girls, people with disabilities, and those with chronic health conditions.\nWe must unite to defeat the scourge of this disease. As governments we need to be able to continue to reach out to help families that have been split up or kept apart, alleviate the consequences of job losses and business closures and continue to provide health care under the enormous strains of pandemic management, all while dealing with drastically plummeting revenue sources.\nMr. President,\nCOVID-19 has also shone a new light on existing global challenges and conflicts, including the escalating threat of arms race and terrorism; continuous human rights abuses; climate change; the displacement of people; the scourge of non-communicable disease, and the disruptions of the technological revolution that is redefining the future of work. Around the world we see the fallout from the pandemic is deepening community divisions, escalating geopolitical tensions, changing trade relations and threatening peace.\nIt is most worrisome that these complex global challenges are compounding at a time when our multilateral environment is under its most severe pressures to date. Make no mistake, we need inclusive multilateralism. The global solidarity and concerted international cooperation we forge today will make us stronger to tackle these challenges together. This time of crisis has heightened our mutual responsibility to strengthen people\u2019s faith in multilateral cooperation and international institutions. The United Nations, with its universal membership, plays a central role in addressing our shared challenges. We should be focusing our efforts on strengthening it, not weakening it. United Nations can be compared to a big boat with individual nations occupying individual cabins in that big boat.\nDomestic Development and Challenges\nMr. President,\nAs a small open island economy located in the South Pacific, we in Vanuatu know too well the importance of global solidarity. We know from experience that we are always better off when we are working together, than in isolation.\nThankfully, there are still no confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 in Vanuatu. Early border closures gave us this precious window to prepare our health responses, but have also come with serious economic and social costs. On top of that, in April, our country was hit by yet another severe, category five tropical cyclone. The severity of this compound disaster has already left enduring scars on families, communities and the nation. Limited resources are strained further by the ongoing recovery efforts from previous disasters. Ever looming is the threat of future disasters and extreme weather events, which are being fuelled and exacerbated by climate change. Even so, our experience assures us that by working together, we can and we will recover, we will build back better and emerge stronger and more resilient.\nIt was in this spirit that we came together as a nation in July to celebrate our 40th anniversary of political independence. We will come together again in December to mark our graduation from Least Developed Country status. Amidst the uncertainty and chaos, this is a special year for us. We especially view our graduation as a success story. We have and always will warmly embrace the solidarity of the LDC group, and the support afforded to it. But in our 40th year as an independent country we are ready for the next phase of our development journey. We are ready to make that step despite the catastrophe that has been unleashed by the pandemic and cyclone, and which will reverberate for many years to come.\nWe are proud of our achievements, as we are mindful that we still have a long way to go to achieve our sustainable development goals. We would rather build on our efforts and those of our development partners and graduate now, with an extended smooth transition period than risk slipping back into the LDC category or halt graduation entirely. It is for that reason that we are seeking the support of bilateral, regional and multilateral development and trading partners to provide full support to the implementation of the smooth transition strategy prepared by Vanuatu, in particular, the priority specific measures that requires targeted support for an extended transitionary period of five years; specific international support measures related to trade, aid for trade and participation in international forums.\nIf we are not careful, the events of this year and the continuing fracturing of multilateralism may dilute our global development aspirations. We all triumphantly signed up to only five years ago under the 2030 Agenda and the 17 sustainable development goals. More than ever we must return to these collective commitments and redouble our implementation efforts. In Vanuatu we have already contextualized these global goals into our national aspirations, articulated in Vanuatu 2030 \u2014 The People\u2019s Plan. This year we have sought to ensure that our National Recovery Strategy not only responds to the immediate social, economic and environmental needs associated with COVD-19 and Cyclone Harold, but that it empowers us to build back better and continue to advance our development aspirations. We must keep moving forward and not just revert back to how it was before. The increasing frequency of extreme weather events and other disasters means recovery has become the new normal.\nBuilding back better will only be possible if we have the right architecture in place. For us and other small island developing states especially, our biggest threats are global \u2014 most notably climate change and the management of our oceans. Therefore our solutions too must be global, and that means it is imperative that the necessary international architecture is in place. With the resources to address our complex challenges becoming scarcer, vulnerable countries such as LDCs and SIDS especially face a daunting future. Put simply, we need a fully functional, working United Nations. We need the UN agencies to be working in solid partnerships with Member States, and with other multilateral organizations. We know there are problems, but we need to find ways to fix these, and not create even greater problems by continuing the trends that are undermining multilateralism and international cooperation.\nBuilding back better also means we can no longer just accept business as usual so I would like to suggest some areas that we, as the United Nations, should focus on to forge a new path to a collectively brighter future.\nFirst, COVID-19 has resulted in mounting debts in countries that can least afford to service them. It is essential that the multilateral financial institutions provide debt forgiveness and relief. This should be accompanied with tailored concessional finance packages and grants. These measures should ensure there is adequate fiscal space for countries to weather not only the current crisis, but also to finance the implementation of their sustainable development priorities. I acknowledge that some great work has already gone ahead in this area, however, I believe more needs to be done.\nSecond, climate financing needs to increase to ensure the recapitalization of financial instruments such as the Green Climate Fund. Again, we call for the processes to access these funds to be simplified and made easier to access in order to allow small island developing states like Vanuatu implement their climate change mitigation and adaptation priorities reflected on various frameworks of implementation including the National Determined Contributions (NDCs).\nThirdly, the UN needs to find ways to address the de risking measures adopted by large international banks that have prevented small island developing states especially to set up corresponding banking relationships with our domestic banks.\nFinally, it is imperative that we ensure every country can get timely, fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, which means working cooperatively and not competitively. The UN must especially ensure that all of the most vulnerable countries in the world get access. Until we have the medical break through that we all pray for, we must unite in our efforts to mitigate the drastic impacts that this crisis is having on our people.\nHuman Rights and Decolonisation\nMr. President,\nAs we look ahead to the future we want, we must picture a world of freedom; one that is free from persecution and human rights abuses. This year, as my country celebrates our 40th anniversary of independence, we are reminded of our strong cultural connection with the Umaenupne and Umaeneag islands, commonly referred to in English as Matthew and Hunter Islands. Although they were integral parts of Vanuatu during its colonial period, France has regrettably and unlawfully claimed them as its own. Beyond representing the failure to complete the decolonization of Vanuatu, France\u2019s actions have impeded the ability of the ni-Vanuatu people to perform their traditional, cultural and religious practices on the islands. This is of particular concern because maintaining our people\u2019s cultural heritage is of the greatest importance to the ni-Vanuatu people, who have endured a long and unfortunate history of colonial exploitation. Although all ni-Vanuatu consider Umaenupne and Umaeneag to be sacred, they have particularly great significance for those who come from the islands of Tanna, Futuna and Aneiytum. For countless generations, the indigenous people of those islands have performed sacred rituals on them. To this day, Umaenupne and Umaeneag continue to maintain a central place in the religious observance of their people. I look forward to their return to the islands, as facilitated by the former UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples.\nFurthermore, we are also mindful that some territories continue their struggle for freedom.\nIn our region, New Caledonia will soon face another referendum on the question of independence. It is important that this remains free, fair and transparent and continues under the supervision of the United Nations.\nMr. President,\nWe know there are widespread human rights violations happening all around us, and yet it seems the world is taking a selective approach to addressing these. In our region, the indigenous people of West Papua continue to suffer from human rights abuses. Last year, leaders from the Pacific Islands Forum respectfully called on the Indonesian Government to allow the United Nations Office of the Human Rights Commissioner to visit West Papua Province. To date there has been little progress on this front. I therefore call on the Indonesian Government to please heed the previous call of Pacific leaders.\nConclusion\nMr. President,\nThe theme of this 75th General Assembly calls on us, the Member States of the United Nations, to come together to frame the future we want. For Vanuatu, this extraordinarily difficult year has been the backdrop to the start of the next phase of nation building, marked by our independence celebrations and culminating with our LDC graduation in a few months. We hope that by sharing our experiences we can contribute to global learning as we navigate the current crisis and work together in the pursuit of sustained peace and sustainable development. As we emerge from the grip of COVID-19, we should continue to align our national and global recovery to existing commitments to reorient growth models to the ones that are more sustainable and greener in nature.\nMore than ever multilateralism must be defended and respond to the evolving needs of our times. The UN Charter remains our moral compass and continues to remind us of our common duties to serve humanity.\nI thank you Mr President and God bless you all."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General and Distinguished Delegates,\nHumanity has overcome a myriad of crises to date to build a civilization we live in today. Although we are now in the middle of the COVID-19 crisis, humanity will surely once again make astonishing strides toward a tomorrow that is different from today.\nI would like to offer my deepest sympathies to the victims of COVID-19 and their bereaved families, and all of those around the world who are fighting the disease. My gratitude also goes out to the medical staff, frontline workers, and staff members of international organizations who are putting themselves at risk to protect the health of humanity.\nThe 75th Session of the UN General Assembly will go a long way toward triumphing over an unprecedented crisis. Let me extend my congratulations to you, Mr. Volkan Bozkir on your assumption of the Presidency. I have high hopes for your able leadership.\nI would also like to express my respect to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his tireless efforts to resolve numerous global challenges from infectious diseases to peace, the economy, the environment and human rights.\nMr. President,\nThe COVID-19 crisis we face is upending daily lives of humanity and agitating even the world economy and international order. Just as the far-sighted leaders created the United Nations 75 years ago, it is high time that we pool our wisdom again to find our guiding star in this time of great transformation.\nThe Republic of Korea took key values of democracy and turned them into three main principles of infectious disease prevention \u2014 openness, transparency, and democracy, and the entire Korean people turned themselves into the main actors in infectious disease prevention efforts.\nKorea also combined multilateralism with its community spirit, enabling people to practice the spirit of \u201cfreedom for all\u201d. The Korean people protected their own safety by protecting that of neighbors. The Korean Government extended the scope of neighbors beyond its borders. By sharing infectious disease prevention equipment with other countries without closing borders, Korea is keeping our country and economy intact.\nWe learned that, in the end, what empowers Korea to weather the novel coronavirus was the very values cultivated by humanity and championed by the UN. The answer to overcoming COVID-19 is not far from us. It lies in returning to the spirit of the UN Charter, that is believing in universal values of humankind, and it lies in marching toward a more inclusive world through multilateral action.\nThe far-sighted leaders in the past created the UN, dreaming of a better world, and achieved a brilliant feat of promoting universal values of humankind. \nIn the post-COVID-19 era, the UN should be tasked with spreading these universal values even further to resolve complex global challenges such as cooperation in healthcare, economic cooperation for sustainable development and climate action.\nThe battles each and every country has been fighting this year have clearly demonstrated that the crisis cannot be overcome by a single country alone, or without consideration of neighbors.\nToday, with the UN assuming a new job in the post-COVID-19 era, I would like to address the importance of strengthening inclusiveness in international cooperation \u2014 a way to shape multilateralism in a way that makes everyone prosperous.\nMr. President,\nStrengthening inclusiveness in international cooperation means leaving no one behind and achieving shared prosperity where everyone enjoys freedom. Domestically, it is reducing inequalities to ensure safety of one\u2019s own and sustainable development together with neighbors. Internationally, it is taking into account the conditions and circumstances neighboring countries are put in while working with them to attain co-prosperity.\nNothing is more important than life and safety of humanity. It is evident that the UN\u2019s idea of inclusive multilateralism will first be tested by whether it can distribute COVID-19 vaccines to all nations or not.\nWe must not only enhance international cooperation for developing vaccines and treatments but also guarantee their equitable access for all countries, once they are developed.\nThrough global funding, we should facilitate advance purchase of sufficient doses of vaccines for international organizations to ensure that impoverished and developing countries can also share in the benefits.\nKorea is actively participating in the COVAX Facility led by the World Health Organization and Gavi.\nHome to the headquarters of the International Vaccine Institute, Korea will provide active support to various activities geared towards developing and distributing affordable vaccines for developing countries.\nAs concerns remain over the possibility of the second and third wave of COVID-19, Korea will actively share its experiences accumulated from responding to COVID-19 and continue to work with the international community.\nLike a tsunami that follows an earthquake, economic aftershocks are sweeping us. Border shutdowns and atrophied exchanges of people and goods make the global economic recovery harder.\nAlthough it is indeed an extraordinarily difficult task, we must make the best of both worlds \u2014 preventing infectious disease and reviving the economy. Even in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, we should strengthen multilateralism characterized by solidarity and cooperation, and bolster free trade system built upon international norms.\nKorea has strived to safeguard global supply chain against disruptions and facilitate essential cross-border movement of people including business people.\nKorea will share its development experience with developing countries and join the concerted global efforts to achieve UN sustainable development goals. In order to enhance inclusiveness that drives sustainable economy, we should break the matter of course that crisis begets widening inequalities and revive our economy in a way that leaves no one behind.\nKorea has taken on a challenge of the Korean New Deal. Standing on the two pillars of Digital New Deal and Green New Deal, it marks a complete transformation of Korean economy and promises to render our society less unequal and more inclusive.\nKorea will work with all nations to minimize effects of COVID-19 and hasten economic recovery, and actively participate in international cooperation to promote inclusive multilateralism the UN is seeking to accomplish.\nSeptember 7 was the International Day of Clean Air for blue skies, which was proposed by Korea and subsequently adopted at the United Nations. Once human activities came to a halt, blue skies re-emerged in parts of the world. The coronavirus has paradoxically given us hope that, with the efforts of countries and international society, humanity can restore a green Earth. With the UN playing a key role, I anticipate greater international cooperation take place in pursuit of building back better and greener.\nKorea is playing an active role in establishing a new climate regime, for instance, by faithfully implementing the Paris Agreement. By renewing nationally determined contributions, we will submit to the UN our fresh national greenhouse gas reduction targets by 2030 by the end of this year. By devising a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy, we will work with the international community in realizing a low-carbon society by 2050.\nIn order to respond to climate change with success, promoting inclusiveness in international cooperation is indispensable. It is impossible for developing countries still in the process of industrialization to instantly catch up with advanced economies that took centuries and decades in the making. Starting with recognizing the glaring gaps, developed countries should make greater efforts to find the optimal solution.\nAs a bridging state connecting developed and developing countries, Korea will actively participate in climate action and faithfully share its unique development experience with developing countries. Next year, Korea will hold the 2nd P4G Summit in Seoul, which will serve as an occasion to affirm the importance of global solidarity in responding to climate change.\nThe region in most urgent need of the spirit of the UN to realize world peace is the Korean Peninsula. The Republic of Korea has been steadfast in seeking inter- Korean reconciliation and is making relentless efforts to achieve denuclearization and establish permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula. With the support and encouragement extended by the international community, Korea was able to successfully host PyeongChang Olympic Winter Games as Peace Olympics joined by North Korea, and it led to three inter-Korean summit meetings. The US-North Korea summit brought by bold decisions from the leaders of the two sides proved that the peace process can progress through dialogue.\nAt the UN General Assembly last year, I presented the three principles to resolve issues related to the Korean War \u2014 zero tolerance for war, a mutual security guarantee and co-prosperity, and set out my vision to transform the Demilitarized Zone into an international peace zone. However, peace on the Korean Peninsula is still in the making and changes that used to brimming with hopes have stalled.\nYet, the Republic of Korea will continue the dialogue. What all of us need to do is to take one more step forward. My belief remains unchanged that we can achieve denuclearization and bring lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula with international community\u2019s continued support and cooperation.\nAt the end of the day, the South and the North are bound by a single community of life, intertwined by mountains, rivers and seas stretching across the two sides. When one is exposed to infectious diseases or natural disasters, so is the other, requiring the two to cooperate to overcome these challenges. Inter-Korean cooperation in disease prevention and control and public health will also trigger dialogue and cooperation in the process of building a peaceful Korean Peninsula.\nToday, the world is expanding the concept of security from traditional security of preserving territorial integrity to comprehensive security. The world has been joining forces to respond to non-traditional security threats from disasters and catastrophes to terrorism and cyber security, and to fight international crimes. However, in the face of the COVID-19 crisis that poses greater threat to humanity than a war, we came to be acutely reminded that the safety of neighboring countries is directly linked to that of our own.\nA single country can no longer manage the entirety of comprehensive security issues alone.\nAs protecting peace of one country and saving life of one person now requires cooperation that transcends borders, we need to equip ourselves with a multilateral security architecture.\nSo far, I have spoken about a peace economy that benefits both Koreas and makes everyone prosperous and stressed the need for inter-Korean cooperation in disaster response and healthcare.\nHoping that the international community views the issues surrounding the Korean Peninsula through the lens of more inclusive international cooperation, I propose today launching a Northeast Asia Cooperation Initiative for Infectious Disease Control and Public Health, whereby North Korea participates as a member along with China, Japan, Mongolia and the Republic of Korea.\nA cooperative architecture that guarantees collective protection of life and safety will lay the groundwork for North Korea to have its security guaranteed by engaging with the international community.\nIn particular, this year marks the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War. Time has come to remove the tragedy lingering on the Korean Peninsula. The War must end, completely and for good.\nPeace on the Korean Peninsula will guarantee peace in Northeast Asia as a whole and, going one step further, bring positive changes to the world order as well. I believe it begins with declaring an end to the War, an act that can affirm mutual commitments to peace. I hope that the UN and the international community provide support so that we can advance into an era of reconciliation and prosperity through the end-of-war declaration. The end-of-war declaration will, indeed, open the door to complete denuclearization and permanent peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.\nIt is not only Korea\u2019s response to COVID-19 but also the invaluable lessons Korea will be gaining from institutionalizing peace that Korea wishes to share with the rest of the world. This way, we will be able to buttress UN\u2019s efforts at the forefront to fulfill its purpose to maintain international peace through collective measures.\nMr. President, Mr. Secretary-General and Distinguished Delegates,\nCOVID-19 has showed us how closely interconnected the world is, and humanity will, in the end, head into an era of solidarity and cooperation.\nWe have to prepare for the future, and at the same time, change the world we live in today. If people start with small things, each and every one\u2019s actions will unite and culminate in the \u201cfreedom for all\u201d today.\nI would like to ask the UN, from this moment onward, to be the center of inclusive international cooperation in the new era.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "Mr President, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen.\nThis is the first time in the UN General Assembly\u2019s 75-year history that world leaders are not gathering in person. The decision to proceed with the High Level Week largely virtually is testament to our commitment to multilateralism and the UN.\nI would like to congratulate His Excellency Volkan Bozkir on his election as President of the 75th session of the General Assembly. I would also thank His Excellency Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, President of the 74th session, for steering the UN through this very challenging period.\nCOVID-19 has become the defining crisis of our time. The global death toll continues to rise, and the global economy, trade, and travel have all been severely disrupted. Millions of jobs and hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost.\nThe world is facing a period of prolonged turmoil. The multilateral system is confronted by nationalism, xenophobia, the rejection of free trade and global economic integration, and the bifurcation of technology and supply chains. But these threats are not new. COVID-19 has in fact accelerated and intensified these preexisting trends. Protectionism and unilateral action will ultimately be self defeating.\nFirst, modern supply chains are very complex. It is extremely difficult to completely onshore all production of key items since the materials and expertise from elsewhere will always be needed at multiple steps of the process. Many countries experienced disruptions to the flow of essential goods during the lockdowns. Supply chains based on \u201cjust-in-time\u201d efficiency are now being reviewed on the basis of \u201cjust-in-case\u201d.\nSecond, bifurcation shrinks the global pool of knowledge and reduces opportunities for the sharing of the benefits of research and innovation. It is because countries were open to sharing scientific knowledge that we were able to produce test kits quickly during this pandemic in the early phase. As my Prime Minister said at the Global Vaccine Summit last June, what we need now is vaccine multilateralism. We need greater international cooperation to ensure equitable and universal access to COVID-19 vaccines\nThird, breaching contractual obligations for the export of critical goods and movement of people erodes trust between nations.\nOur path to the post-COVID-19 \u201cnew normal\u201d will not be linear. At each stage of the way, all countries need to balance the public health concerns with economic and social concerns, and make trade-offs based on their unique national circumstances. Continued international cooperation is key to overcoming the devastating impact of the pandemic and to rebuilding. We need to build greater trust, and we need to learn from one another. We also need to cooperate to establish safe protocols in order to re-start travel again.\nImportance of Multilateralism\nThe pandemic has not changed Singapore\u2019s fundamental belief in the necessity of multilateralism. Small countries make up over half of the membership at the UN. It is essential to have a system where small sovereign states have an equal voice and disputes can be settled peacefully, in accordance with international law and agreed rules. This is why Singapore worked with a cross-regional group of countries to establish the Forum of Small States back in 1992. The Forum of Small States has always been a champion of the UN and for a rules-based multilateral system. You can count on the Forum of Small States to continue speaking up for a stronger UN and for greater multilateralism.\nBut the multilateral system does not only advance the interests of just small states. Large nations also benefit from acting through multilateral institutions because they gain political legitimacy. We all benefit from a more peaceful, stable and prosperous global environment. Multilateral institutions provide an avenue for countries to pool our ideas and to work together to deal with the common challenges facing humanity, including COVID-19 now, and are also essential for us to advance our shared interests.\nThe current system is not perfect. Much more has to be done to strengthen and reform the rules-based multilateral system. It needs to be fit for purpose, and be able to adapt to the changing realities of today.\nOvercoming and Recovering from COVID-19\nThere are several short- and medium-term challenges that we need to overcome. First, we need to defeat COVID-19 together. We need to understand that none of us, in nations large or small, will be safe until all of us are safe together. And what we need now is more global cooperation, not less. We have to ensure that medical supplies and scientific collaboration can continue to flow across borders, and we need to intensify our exchange of information and infection protocols, if we hope to resume some semblance of a \u201cnormal\u201d life, including the resumption of international travel, and to do all this safely.\nIn this context, the pursuit of vaccine multilateralism is critical to ensure universal and equitable access to a COVID-19 vaccine, and to maximise the global health impact of an eventual vaccine. Singapore and Switzerland have been working with thirteen other like-minded partners as Friends of the COVID 19 Vaccine Global Access Facility. COVAX, for short. The COVAX Facility seeks to reduce risk and facilitate equitable access to vaccines by all nations.\nWe continue to support the World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) efforts in formulating responses to COVID-19 and to facilitating vaccine development. Postpandemic, it may be necessary to review how the WHO processes can be improved further, but for now, we should focus on the immediate priority of overcoming the pandemic.\nSecond, we need to work together to rebuild our communities and institutions. In the immediate term, we need to help those who have lost their family members, lost livelihoods and had their education interrupted. We should also consider ways to tackle the inequalities which COVID-19 has exposed and in some cases exacerbated. We need to build more equitable societies.\nEnsuring an open trading system is key to rebuilding efforts. No country can be completely self-sufficient. It is in the interest of all countries that we uphold and strengthen supply chain connectivity. In fact, seeking more markets and diversifying our sources of supply will build resilience. This is why Singapore issued a Joint Ministerial Statement affirming supply chain connectivity with Australia, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, Brunei and Myanmar, and at the UN, spearheaded the Joint Statement on Open Markets, Flow of Essential Goods and Supply Chain Connectivity which, I am glad to report, had 175 co-sponsors.\nIt is hard to over-emphasise that the open, rules-based multilateral trading system is a foundation for sustainable global recovery. The system has allowed countries to trade in goods and services in mutually beneficial ways. It has raised hundreds of millions of people from poverty. In the aftermath of COVID-19, we should look at ways to support and strengthen this system to make it work better for the future. We also need to rebuild safe and reliable transport networks to facilitate the resumption of people mobility.\nThird, as we rebuild, we must continue the important work of increasing resilience to meet the challenges posed by the digital revolution, by cybersecurity threats, by climate change, and transboundary pollution.\nI shall focus today on the challenges posed specifically by the digital revolution and climate change. We must harness new digital technology for the benefit of all our societies whilst mitigating the possible negative impact. COVID-19 has accelerated the deployment of artificial intelligence, robotics, digital payments, e-government services, and remote work.\nAt the national level, we need to ensure digital inclusion, especially for communities such as older persons, people with disabilities and the financially disadvantaged. We have a responsibility to help our people to upskill and re-skill to be equipped for jobs of the future. We also have to help our businesses leverage digital tools to grow, become more efficient, more competitive and to find new customers.\nAt the international level, governments, businesses, and individuals need to be able to transact and transfer data securely across borders. It is thus critical to collectively develop a trusted, open, and inclusive cyberspace underpinned by international law and norms of responsible State behaviour. This is why Singapore strongly supports the UN Secretary-General\u2019s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation. We will also continue to work with the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security and the Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTs in the Context of International Security, the OEWG, for short.\nOn climate change, the Paris Agreement established a very important global consensus for action on climate change. We must not lose sight of our goal to preserve this planet for future generations. COVID-19 showed how inextricably linked our well-being is to the health of our one and only planet and for the environment that envelopes us. It is irrefutable that respect for biodiversity and wildlife is essential for humankind\u2019s own health and our existence. Countries should therefore align recovery efforts with longterm climate goals.\nClimate change presents a clear and present danger for Singapore and indeed, for all other small island nations. Although our impact on global emissions is small, we are especially vulnerable, and that is why Singapore takes our climate action obligations so seriously. We submitted our enhanced 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution to the Paris Agreement and Long-Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy for 2050 and beyond to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in March 2020, even in the midst of tackling this current pandemic.\nThe Post-COVID Multilateral System\nCountries cannot hope to go back to the way things were before COVID 19 came upon us, and neither can the multilateral system. We must adapt and we must reinforce our international institutions so that they remain open, inclusive, transparent, and fit for purpose.\nThe role of the UN, in particular, is crucial. It is indispensable as a universal platform for cooperation, based on the principles of equality, mutual respect, mutual benefit and international law. But the UN itself must adapt and reform in order to respond effectively to contemporary and future challenges if it is to remain relevant for the next 75 years.\nThe UN Secretary-General has already initiated some of this essential work. But the reform of the UN should not only be geared towards meeting new challenges, but also on promoting the forging of consensus amongst Member States on emerging issues. There needs to be continued emphasis on longstanding issues like support for Small Island Developing States and the Least Developed Countries.\nWe need to concurrently revitalise the General Assembly and make a genuine attempt to reform the Security Council. International governance, now more than ever before, needs to be more representative, more inclusive, and more open. We need to take into account a wide spectrum of views and do more to acknowledge the rich diversity of our global community. The UN and the Secretary-General\u2019s ability to take on current and future challenges also depends on the political and financial commitment from member states. It is thus essential that we continue to support.\nLikewise, other multilateral institutions, such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO), need to be reformed as well. The WTO is the neutral arbiter for international trade disputes with the mandate to monitor and enforce internationally agreed trade laws. Singapore, as a strong supporter of a rules based multilateral trading system, believes in the value of the WTO, and this has brought decades of prosperity to all of us. However, the WTO\u2019s rules were designed for an agricultural and manufacturing- based world economy, and today are in urgent need of reform. The world needs appropriate rules for services, especially digital services and intellectual property, in preparation for this digital age that is unfolding in front of us.\nSingapore is committed to working with others to keep the WTO relevant and well-functioning. For instance, we worked with 22 other like-minded countries to establish the Multi-Party Interim Appeal Arbitration Arrangement to keep the WTO\u2019s arbitration mechanism functioning.\nWe expect the World Intellectual Property Organisation\u2019s role to grow as the world moves progressively online, into cyberspace, and new value is created.\nWe must seize the opportunity of the UN\u2019s 75th anniversary and that presented by the current COVID-19 pandemic to reinvigorate the rules-based multilateral system. We have a chance to collectively recreate the conditions for inclusive economic growth envisioned in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We need to strengthen our collective ability to respond to future shocks, and COVID-19 has been a clear and present example of that shock, and we need to be able to respond through the multilateral system.\nThis current crisis has brought into sharp relief our common humanity. We must not leave anyone behind or alone.\nThank you very much."

        "file_text": "Excellency Mr. Volkan Bozkir, President of the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly;\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen Heads of State and Government;\nExcellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations;\nLadies and Gentlemen;\nHonourable Delegates;\nMr. President,\nAt the outset, I would like to congratulate you on your brilliant election to the Presidency of the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly, and to pay a heartfelt tribute to your predecessor, Professor Tijjani Muhammad Bande of Nigeria, for having been able to adapt the functioning of the General Assembly to the constraints derived from the 2019 coronavirus disease (Covid-19).\nI also pay tribute to the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, for his tireless plea for greater support for developing countries in the face of this unprecedented health crisis. The unprecedented format of this 75th session of our General Assembly points to the gravity of the situation the world is experiencing, and the need to do everything possible to ensure that our Organization can continue to fulfil its missions in the service of humanity.\nMr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nFor the past several months, Covid-19 has been disrupting life in our countries and plunging the world into a large-scale socioeconomic crisis, the most serious since the beginning of the 21st century. Despite significant advances in health and scientific research, we seem powerless to stop the spread of the virus or mitigate its impact. The death toll from the pandemic is on the rise, the global economy is practically at a standstill and countries are now holed up behind their borders. People\u2019s daily lives have been thrown into disarray, with dramatic consequences for the most fragile sectors of the population.\nUnder these circumstances, the pandemic could wipe out more than a decade of economic growth and social progress made by the African continent, which everyone agrees is demonstrating extraordinary resilience. This progress is due, in particular, to the foresight of Governments and their ability to adopt bold response plans, despite limited resources.\nTo confront this pandemic, my country, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, adopted a Health Response Plan of approximately 171 million US dollars and an Economic, Social and Humanitarian Support Plan of 3 billion US dollars, intended to support the private sector and low-income households. In total, this massive unprecedented effort, which represents 5% of my country\u2019s GDP, has produced impressive results in the fight against COVID-19. These results are among the best on the African continent, thanks in particular to our competent and devoted health-care workers.\nThis is the appropriate setting to commend the international solidarity that has benefited Cote d\u2019Ivoire through the implementation of these programmes and to thank all the friendly countries and development partners who have provided us with support and assistance through various financial, technical and material contributions.\nThese excellent results are also the fruit of major reforms and investments in the health-care sector. In fact, during the 2018-2020 period, we invested around 1.5 billion US dollars in the health sector to support the implementation of Universal Health Coverage. We intend to pursue this virtuous approach in terms of health governance throughout the 2021-2025 period, with an investment of around 3 billion US dollars.\nHowever, in the face of this common enemy, Covid-19, the world has persistently displayed a divided front, delaying the emergence of a collective and effective solution. Amid the panic instigated by Covid-19, we abandoned the frameworks and instruments that would have enabled us to show greater solidarity and mobilize the resources necessary to finance national health, economic and humanitarian response plans. As far as Africa and particularly my country are concerned, the multifaceted support provided by some of our main development partners is important, but it is insufficient and incommensurable as compared to the amounts released individually by the major economies, or collectively by certain regional communities for the benefit of their members.\nMr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nFaced with the spread of Covid-19, developing countries, especially African countries, are more severely affected by the economic and social effects derived from the lack of global initiatives supporting their economies. In this context, in my capacity as Champion for the implementation of the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063, I welcome the G20\u2019s initiative to grant a moratorium on bilateral government debt repayments to the benefit of several African countries.\nI call on all partners across the continent to take bolder measures aimed at relieving the burden on our economies, which have been hard hit by the effects of Covid-19. Africa\u2019s financial needs are estimated at 100 billion US dollars per year over three (3) years, or a total of 300 billion US dollars. In addition, countries should be granted room for budgetary manoeuvre to allow them to pursue the necessary social investments and take into account security needs, especially in countries combating terrorism.\nThe world must finally hear the call of Africans to cancel their countries\u2019 public debt. My country supports the African Union\u2019s efforts to collectively renegotiate the continent\u2019s debt with creditors, and to obtain an extension of the above-mentioned debt moratorium. But we must go further and act without further delay. African countries need lasting solutions, including funds and investment, in order to withstand the unprecedented shock suffered by our peoples and pursue the continent\u2019s development process.\nAmong these solutions, I recommend recourse to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s Special Drawing Rights \u2014 a mechanism that already proved to be effective during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.\nThe fight against Covid-19 must not obscure other diseases such as malaria and AIDS, which claim more victims in African countries. Above all, it must not destroy our efforts to combat poverty. In this area, my country launched vigorous reforms that have reduced poverty by 15.6 percentage points in eight years.\nThe regional study on poverty by the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) and the World Bank indeed confirms that Cote d\u2019Ivoire went from a poverty rate of 55.01% in 2011 to 39.4% in 2018. This means that around 1.6 million Ivorians were lifted out of poverty during that period.\nFurthermore, again according to recent statistics from the World Bank, Cote d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita has more than doubled, from 1120 US dollars in 2011 to 2290 US dollars in 2019, meaning Cote d\u2019Ivoire has the highest per capita income of any country in the West African subregion.\nCote d\u2019Ivoire owes these results to a dynamic economy driven by rigorous governance, which has enabled us, over the past nine (9) years, to achieve an average growth rate of 8% per year. The economy\u2019s growth rate is estimated at around 1.8% in 2020 and forecast to be around 7.9% in 2021. Despite the particularly difficult context with regard to Covid-19, we are continuing to roll out programmes with a social impact, such as the Government\u2019s Social Programme, which will enable us to further reduce the poverty rate.\nIn that respect, thanks to electrification programmes, improved access to drinking water and enhanced education and health care, we have enabled millions of our fellow citizens to benefit from electricity and drinking water, and the presence of schools and health-care centres near to their living spaces.\nMr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nThe Covid-19 pandemic reminds us how much the world needs the United Nations in order to act, together, for the common good. We must put our common Organization back at the centre of the collective response to this pandemic. At the health-care level, that means ensuring that everyone has access to a vaccine as soon as it becomes available.\nOn the economic front, the financial assistance provided to developing countries must be increased and better coordinated.\nCovid-19 underscores the threats our world is called upon to face over the coming few years, which should lead us to strengthen the means of action of the United Nations, and its partnership with regional organizations. No country will be able to meet these new challenges alone, owing to their global nature and harmful consequences on people and economies.\nSadly, nowadays, the effectiveness of the United Nations and multilateral cooperation mechanisms, where consensual solutions are forged to tackle global challenges, are constantly put under severe strain, as a result of unilateral initiatives fuelled by strategic rivalries and competing leaderships.\nMr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nThe United Nations is celebrating seventy-five (75) years this year. I remain convinced that we must support and revitalize multilateralism as the only means of guaranteeing lasting international peace and stability. The challenges related to global warming, poverty, terrorism and the persistence of the nuclear threat and armed conflicts, among others, further legitimize this renewed multilateral ambition to which my country subscribes. This underpinned our accession to the Paris Agreement on climate change and the decisions undertaken during our mandate on the United Nations Security Council, which ended in 2019. It is also the reason for our participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations, and our commitment to finding peaceful solutions to disputes in our region.\nIn order to give greater legitimacy and credibility to our common Organization, there is an urgent need to carry out the reform of the Security Council. It is necessary to build the broadest consensus around the issue of Africa\u2019s full and effective entry into the United Nations Security Council on a permanent basis. It is time for Africa to finally take its place in this important Organ.\nMr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nThe Ivorian people will elect their next President of the Republic on 31 October 2020. Despite the Covid-19 health crisis, all measures have been taken to ensure that this election is peaceful and transparent, as was the case in 2015.1 am delighted with the effective participation of all stakeholders in this process and would like to express my deep gratitude to all partners, in particular the United Nations, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the African Union, which have all committed to the success of this electoral consultation alongside Cote d\u2019Ivoire.\nThis election is taking place in a democratic environment, bolstered by important sociopolitical reforms and by undeniable economic and human progress, making my country a prosperous nation and one of the most successful economies in the world.\nMr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate the full support of Cote d\u2019Ivoire for the United Nations, which must remain the preferred framework for providing lasting responses to the major challenges of our time.\nI wish the United Nations every success and a happy 75th anniversary.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "Distinguished President of the United Nations General Assembly,\nDistinguished Secretary-General of the United Nations,\nEsteemed Excellencies,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nI am honored to have the opportunity, for the first time, to address, on behalf of the Republic of North Macedonia, this global forum, which this year, due to the circumstances in which we meet, is unique \u2014 for the first time, and I sincerely hope for the last, without our personal presence, at the headquarters of our organization.\nThis 2020 is undoubtedly one of the most difficult years that humanity is living in recent history. In just a few months, the pandemic, in addition to taking nearly one million lives, has left far-reaching consequences in almost every area of our lives, which will take years to fully recover. COVID-19 caused tectonic changes in the order we know, but also provided us with a realistic insight into the national capacities of public health for dealing with crises of planetary dimensions.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nCOVID-19 is just another in the whole spectrum of crises we face as humanity and none of them is fully isolated from the others. The health crisis is both economic and social because it causes poverty, and poverty is fertile ground for extremism and conflict. Conflicts threaten human rights and freedoms and cause humanitarian catastrophes and waves of refugees. This vortex of crises and threats generates fear, uncertainty and mistrust and polarizes the relations between states, but also within states, and finally undermines multilateralism, which today is more needed than ever.\n2020 should be a turning point for all of us. Today, instead of the existing static order created after the Second World War, we need a functional and dynamic system of shared rules and principles that we believe in, adapted to the new times. We need a new model of active, inclusive multilateralism, recognizable by solidarity between nations and humanity among people. In this context, one of the great tasks of the United Nations is to help us keep our focus and keep our collective consciousness and conscience for the global good awake.\nWhen it comes to our shared goals, let me recall the words of the former Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold, who said that the purposes of the Charter \u201care expressions of universally shared ideals which cannot fail us, though we, alas, often fail them\u201d. In other words, our organization can be as effective as its Member States allow.\nTherefore, in order to overcome this period, we need solidarity between the states, which shall not be reflected only in the field of health. We must also be in solidarity with the future that we need to build together.\nEsteemed Excellencies,\nThe tragedy caused by COVID-19 should not be used to raise geopolitical tensions and strengthen the geopolitical rivalry among the great powers. Science must stay aside from the logic of profit, but also from the destructive effects of propaganda and misinformation. Policies focused on quick results always have a short-term effect. If we treat crises in isolation from each other, we will only alleviate the symptoms without curing humanity. An integral approach is therefore necessary. The pandemic is also an opportunity to restructure economies, technologies and lifestyles, in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. We will not eradicate poverty only with short-term financial assistance to the poorest, but through systematic adaptation of those people to have a dignified life and equal opportunities to work, earn money, start families. If we do the opposite, the gap between rich and poor will widen and inequality will still be passed down from one generation to the next.\nWe see that a new generation of inequalities related to education, technology and climate change is already approaching, which will surely result in new, huge divisions within the societies. We already see that in young people. While some, disappointed by the lack of prospects, leave their countries, others flee to instant gratification and superficial values.\nMember States must continue to strive for universal education for all, because education is the most powerful guarantor of human rights and freedoms.\nThe 25th anniversary of the World Conference on Women reminds us that it is necessary to continue our efforts to reduce inequality between men and women, which is still a reality in many parts of the world. Moreover, we need to continuously strengthen tolerance for different lifestyles and protect these groups from the widespread violence against them.\nOur economic and technical-technological development must become climate neutral. In doing so, we need to focus on developing and supporting innovative environmental approaches and sustainable development strategies. Unfortunately, in order to repair the economic damage caused by the pandemic, many governments and companies are already making compromises at the expense of the environmental and climate agenda. By doing so, they only protect the unsustainable economic model of development based on fossil fuels and the use of underpaid labor.\nIf we hope that new technologies can continue to build on our old habits, we will only worsen the situation. We must learn, acquire new, sustainable habits that will be adequate to the new technologies.\nIt is clear to all of us that the time for action is very short. We have only 10 years left to implement the ambitious Agenda 2030. Even before the pandemic, we had difficulties in implementing some of its key goals. Now, for their implementation, we must simultaneously mitigate the economic and social consequences of the pandemic that is still present. To win this race against time, instead of half-effective measures that only delay the consequences, we need bold and long-term solutions that will surely outlive the governments that have passed them.\nDear Friends,\nThe promotion of peace and the prevention of conflicts, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, have no alternative. Terrorism and violent extremism threaten us all. The Republic of North Macedonia joins the Secretary General\u2019s call for a global truce and full respect for international humanitarian law in these extraordinary circumstances. My country, within its capabilities, is an active participant in UN peacekeeping missions, but also within regional organizations such as the OSCE, the European Union and the missions of the North Atlantic Alliance. In this context, we support the efforts for a new nuclear arms control treaty and believe that the efforts of our strategic partners to include new nuclear forces therein is an important contribution to greater efficiency in preventing a new race for armament.\nAs a small country in South-East Europe, we have brought additional stability to the region by resolving, through the mediation of the UN, the complex dispute with our neighbor Greece. Now we are implementing in good faith the agreed, which will benefit both our countries and the region as a whole. At the same time, we are ready to resolve all open issues through dialogue of equal subjects, seen in the Good Neighborliness and Cooperation Treaty with our neighbor, the Republic of Bulgaria, which serves as a significant example thereof.\nUnfortunately, our region still faces unresolved political and historical disputes that have the potential to take us back to the 1990s. The solution to these problems lies only in overcoming historical myths, the way out is certainly not in the ideologies of the 19th century for ethnic and religious domination.\nIn this context, it is of utmost importance that investments are not reduced to investing only in economies. Democracy, which after the end of the Cold War we were convinced had no real alternative, is today under fierce attack on populist and authoritarian tendencies. If we want to maintain the moral superiority of democracy over other models of political governance, we must invest in it, especially among the young generations. In this sense, one of the fundamental challenges before us is to invest in the education about democratic values in order to suppress the awakened radical ideologies, such as neo-fascism, ultra-nationalism and racism. It is a task for the states and formal education, but, not less for the system of non-formal education, as well as for the civil society.\nTo be successful, this battle is fought on multiple fronts simultaneously. Every country, every nation and every organization can contribute. But preconditions for achieving the goal are effective international cooperation and global solidarity, for which we need the United Nations, reformed and adapted to the new reality.\nWith all its shortcomings, this organization remains the only truly global, neutral and legitimate platform for cooperation. Regarding the need for its thorough reform, the challenges we all face can only be solved with more, not less multilateralism, which, in addition to governments and states, will include the private sector, international governmental and non-governmental organizations, academia and associations of young people, women and the marginalized, who rightly seek truth, justice and equality.\nIn the spirit of multilateralism, the Republic of North Macedonia will continue to fulfill its international obligations and support the work of the United Nations and\nits specialized agencies in creating and implementing public policies on issues of global importance.\nOn our decisions today, at the peak of the pandemic, depends how our world will look like after the pandemic. This is a rare opportunity, supporting the world organization and supporting each other, to take steps towards creating a more peaceful and just world in which faith in humanism, freedom, solidarity and respect for human dignity will be restored. It is clear that only by investing in the United Nations will we be able to build a better world for both present and future generations.\nThank you for your attention."

        "file_text": "Heads of State and Government,\nMr. Volkan Bozkir, President of the United Nations General Assembly at its seventy-fifth session,\nMr. Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations,\nGreetings to you all.\nSeventy-five years ago, 51 countries signed the Charter of the United Nations, hoping to rid the world of war and ensure respect for the dignity and fundamental rights of people with justice, social progress and freedom.\nAs a founding Member State, Honduras has supported these lofty goals from the very beginning.\nWe were all moved by the consequences of the two great World Wars and sought, back then, to show the best of our human species by uniting in this global forum, creating this Organization, which is the largest international organization in the world today. In the same way, now that we are immersed in a new global crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we must seek new ideas and new consensus and to be more creative and wiser in order to make the purposes and principles set forth in 1945 a reality.\nI myself, as a survivor of this disease and as a leader of a developing nation struggling to beat the pandemic, would like to express our concern about the consequences of the emergency situation we are grappling with today. The multifaceted impact of the crisis has affected our generation in an unprecedented way in terms of health, education, migration, basic services, human rights and the economy, particularly in those most vulnerable countries. That has caused great social damage, with medicine and food shortages and job losses, and now the monumental task of rebuilding our economies looms. We must maintain the balance between protecting health and prioritizing life. We must restore confidence in our peoples, who are asking themselves \u201cWhat next?\u201d\nThese global crises are likely to continue, along with social unrest around the world, not only due to the threat of greater public health problems but by conflicts over land ownership, food, water and political ideologies, inter alia.\nBefore I continue to address this issue, which is our main focus here today, I would like to speak about certain notable achievements worth mentioning that we as a Government have realized together with the Honduran people:\nToday, Honduras has managed to reduce the number of violent deaths by almost 60 per cent. Not only have we ceased to be one of the most violent countries in the world but, by joining forces, for the first time in history we have been able to confront our internal fearsome criminal and bloodthirsty structures, despite them having sufficient muscle and economic power to destabilize a nation. We did so without fear and fully aware of what we were dealing with.\nHonduras wishes to acknowledge and express its gratitude to the United Nations system for its support in our struggle to protect our people \u2014 one of the many crucial areas in which we have worked together. I take this opportunity to remind you of our request in recent years for non-State organized groups, such as gangs and drug traffickers, to be recognized by the United Nations as terrorist groups.\nOver the past 75 years, we have heard magnificent orators in this forum and great speeches written by the top intellectuals from every country; we have seen great leaders in their finest attire speaking the best turns of phrase; however, we have not been able to avoid wars, prevent inequality, eradicate poverty or eliminate many endemic or epidemic diseases.\nOver the past 75 years, I do not believe that we have fully achieved the altruistic goals set out when this Organization was created, not least all the purposes and principles that were established in 1945.\nThe pandemic has laid bare the true inequality that exists in our world. At a time when we are all looking to acquire medicines, hospital supplies, equipment or the much sought-after vaccines, only a few countries will be first in line with broad access to them \u2014 and they will not be those most in need.\nWe have also seen how, when medicine is in short supply, the producing country withholds production. The same thing happens with medical equipment: in some countries, production has been appropriated for their exclusive use, while sales to other countries are prohibited. What about all the other nations? Will people just be left to die? What about the vaccines? Who will have access to them? Is there already a list of countries for that?\nIn our particular case, we received certain recommendations from the World Health Organization at the beginning of the pandemic that we considered to be most timely and useful. Support from the PAHO in relation to the acquisition of medical supplies and equipment also served us well, but there were occasions on which we did not agree with their recommendations, for instance when we were told that the use of face masks was unnecessary. Nevertheless, we decided to provide masks to our entire population and continued to make our own decisions based on our own experience.\nWe consider our doctors and health workers, who have been fighting this pandemic on the front lines, to be heroes. They have risked their lives and worked tirelessly on a daily basis over the past six months. Precisely on the basis of their experience, they been able to identify some medicines that, in practice, have yielded promising results and are cheap and freely available in our country. Thanks to two treatments in particular, known as MAIZ and CATRACHO per their Spanish acronyms, we have been able to reduce the mortality rate from 9 per cent at the beginning of the pandemic to 3 per cent or lower. Furthermore, thanks to the Fuerza Honduras programme, which helped to provide each municipality with the required medical equipment and logistical support, we have been able to offer free health care to those in need through stabilization and triage centres, as well as medical teams conducting home visits.\nWe will never tire of thanking our heroes fighting on the front line: our doctors, our health workers and our security and relief personnel.\nWhen technology and science exist to anticipate certain situations, especially if information concerning a global health threat is available, then that information must be shared with all countries in a transparent and timely manner, thereby preventing such information from being manipulated to benefit the interests of particular nations. For example, it was very helpful for our doctors to receive and share information from and with doctors in Europe and the Americas. Had this not happened, we would have considered it a crime against humanity. It is also the obligation of all States participating in the system to put such sensitive information with a direct impact on human life at the service of the world, whether through the World Health Organization or directly to other countries.\nIf the pandemic does not change our attitude towards others, then nothing will. The virus has attacked us all equally \u2014 it does not discriminate between rich and poor. The disease has reminded us in the harshest way that, in the end, we are all vulnerable humans, members of the same species, even if we speak in different languages, wear different clothes or live in different parts of the world. That is something upon which we must reflect.\nI also believe, with all due respect, that it is high time we review the entire United Nations system. We must urgently seek its greater efficiency and effectiveness so that it may achieve the purposes for which it exists.\nThis Organization must generate the knowledge and information necessary to prepare us for what lies ahead. We need a permanent, forward-looking analysis, with the best resources and technology, so that we do not continue blindly moving forward. Our peoples deserve equal access to health, technology, information and education. In view of what is happening today, it is imperative that the Sustainable Development Goals agreed upon in 2015 be revised, updated and reconsidered in line with the new reality we are experiencing today.\nMeanwhile, we must strive to avoid excessive and inefficient bureaucracies. For example, at the beginning of the pandemic, we sought the support of the United Nations Development Programme in launching a digital wallet project that would allow us to make transparent economic transfers to those most in need of an income in our country. Several months have now passed and, although I spoke personally with some of the system\u2019s senior official, the process has not yet been completed and those affected are still awaiting assistance.\nLadies and Gentlemen:\nThe events of the past, present and future have been, are and will be highly contingent upon climate change. New epidemics arise from changes in the environment, as do the scarcity of resources and hunger. They all share a common genesis in a lack of respect for nature and the plundering of our natural resources. It is now necessary that we move from theory to facts and from fine, eloquent words to hard-hitting statements of reality: climate change has been an emergency for several years and yet the famous Green Climate Fund funding is nowhere to be found.\nWe have been seeking and waiting for that funding for several years now, to no avail. By the way, does anyone know where it is, or why it has not materialized? Why has that funding not reached the countries that need it most, like ours?\nI wish to recall that Honduras is one of the three most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change in the world. Every year, we are affected by drought, heavy rainfall and floods and diseases that damage our crops, such as coffee and grain, which have severely suffered in recent years as a result of extreme weather. That has had a terrible impact on the economy and the health of our people. Coffee prices, for example, are now improving a little in comparison with previous years, but that demonstrates only the volatility of a sector that is the livelihood of millions of families in the world.\nAn illustrious citizen of the world once said: \u201cInsanity is doing always the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\u201d\nWe must do something soon to translate words into deeds and rhetoric into action in that and all other areas. Is no one bothered by this? Is no one\u2019s conscience troubled that, year after year, things remain the same? It bothers me! I am certain that I am not the only one who is troubled and uneasy, and for everyone\u2019s sake, I must say that we still have time.\nMr. Secretary-General,\nClimate change, natural disasters and epidemics affect our economy, and those problems are not always the fault of small countries, but, by affecting the economy, they prevent us from complying with the parameters imposed on us by financial bodies. It is only fair that such events and phenomena be taken into account so that the most vulnerable and poorest countries are not be punished with bad ratings. Tailored focus must be provided to address to their specific needs, as well as unique approaches to achieve economic and social growth.\nIt is time for us to talk seriously about the financial relief that we must receive from our international creditors, by which I mean the multilateral lending agencies. So far, they have not been up to the task of dealing with this colossal tragedy and the response needed for financing, establishing moratoriums and addressing the collapse of our economies has been poor.\nAs we believe that it is necessary not only to provide criticism, but also solutions concerning a comparable global challenge, we respectfully propose that the Secretary-General convene a select group of world leaders, who have been successful in the areas of economic development, health-care systems, education, small businesses, and applying technology to the new reality facing the world, among others, to help create a plan or a road map. If we all succeed, we all win.\nIt will only be then that the United Nations System will be able to say that it rose to the occasion and that our generation will have served our children and our children\u2019s children.\nFarewell."

        "file_text": "President of the 75th Session of the UN General Assembly, H.E. Volkan Bozkir,\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, H.E. Antonio Guterres,\nExcellencies,\nDistinguished Delegates,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nI am, indeed, delighted to participate in this 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, despite the unusual circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nLet me, take this opportunity Mr. President, to thank you and to congratulate you on your election and I wish you a productive and successful 75th session and assure you of Kenya\u2019s full as well as constructive support.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate your predecessor, H.E. Professor Tijjani Muhammad-Bande for ably steering the 74th Session of the General Assembly during this very very difficult season. He ensured that, not notwithstanding the difficulties of the pandemic, the work of the United Nations continued.\nMr. President,\nThe 75th Anniversary is a moment to reflect on the journey that we have taken. It is a moment to introspect, to establish if the anchor still holds or if our community of nations has become unanchored by the challenges of our time.\nThis is an occasion to reflect on our world and its institutions; have our relations and institutions been refined by experience and the passage of time or have our institutions become battered and left not fit for purpose.\nAt 75, the United Nations is older than most of its Member States and more importantly older than over 96 per cent of our global population. A clear majority of the global population today cannot relate to the circumstances of its founding. Yes, the United Nations in its birth \u201cbrought rules and hope for a world in ruins\u201d that was seven and a half decades ago, but what does it bring to the world today?\nSeventy five years ago, delegates from fifty nations who had endured immense disruption and suffering, seized the opportunity to chart a bold new course for mankind. They were determined to save future generations from the scourge of war and in so doing they gifted us a timeless Charter that has remained our shared framework of international cooperation.\nExcellencies,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nOn this occasion of the 75th Anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, \u201cWe the People of the United Nations\u201d must rekindle the Idealism, Will and Spirit of the San Francisco conference that founded our great organization.\nToday, mankind is confronted by complex, multifaceted and gravely serious challenges. Across the world, we are witnessing constant disruptions that are generating great anxiety, uncertainty and unpredictability. The COVID19 pandemic best defines the challenges of our time; a challenge that affects us all, a challenge that we can only overcome if each of us succeeds.\nThe COVID19 pandemic and other contemporary challenges including the climate and biodiversity crisis that we face, our growing geostrategic tensions, social as well as economic inequalities, the crisis of legitimacy and governance as well as the vulnerabilities of our digital world, have, indeed, redefined the imperative for multilateral action.\nKenya believes strongly that if we remain anchored in multilateralism and with unity of purpose, if we are much more agile in embracing change and positive transformations, if we remain rooted in a rule-based international system and act innovatively and selflessly, we can transcend our challenges and secure lasting peace and prosperity for all.\nThis firm persuasion is born of our own experience and evolution of as a nation.\nMuch like the United Nations, our country was founded on the ideals of liberty, unity, rule of law, democracy and participation of the people, grounded on human dignity, equity, social justice, inclusiveness, equality, human rights and good governance. I believe these are all shared global values and Kenya acknowledges that we have had our challenges in meeting this but that doesn\u2019t change the vision that we have for the future.\nAll these issues have worked for us in our domestic context and I believe that they will serve the United Nations well and we are confident that our community of nations, can do far much more collectively than any one country could ever do alone.\nExcellencies,\nThe theme for our 75th Assembly namely, \u201cThe Future that We Want; the United Nations that We Need: Reaffirming our Collective Commitment to Multilateralism\u201d, is most appropriate and indeed timely. It speaks not only to the urgent need to review our actions at both the national and global levels, but also responds to the pressing demand for effective multilateral action, within a rule-based international system.\nIndeed, the COVID-19 pandemic should give fresh impetus to our collective efforts to strengthen international cooperation. This global pandemic has deepened unfortunately existing inequalities, hitting the poorest and most vulnerable communities the hardest. It has created an unprecedented synergy of challenges and demonstrated the limits of our institutions.\nThere is, therefore, an urgent need to improve readiness in the area of global crises management. But more importantly, to effectively take urgent, coordinated and collective measures to build resilience that would insulate our societies and our economies against the adverse effects of such pandemic and crisis.\nIn Kenya, we have had to undertake special and targeted efforts. A national multi agency team on COVID19 is in place to ensure such appropriate interventions. We have revamped and expanded our national and county health care systems. The interventions that we have taken have targeted the old and the vulnerable, the unemployed and our youth and specific programmes to keep them healthy and productively engaged. We have also recognized that this pandemic has in itself produced the challenges of gender inequality and more so gender violence.\nWe have introduced financial and tax interventions to keep the economy and businesses viable and solvent. And like everyone else, introduced social health measures including cessation of travel, social distancing, the wearing of masks and improved hygiene for all.\nAnd this has been achieved to the best of our abilities within an environment of constitutional civil liberties and rights to prosperity and development of all our citizenry.\nAt the continental level, Mr. President, working with the African Union, I have been involved personally in guiding collective continental actions, together with other Heads of State and Government, who are members of the African Union Bureau. We adopted a continental COVID-19 mitigation strategy, which has had great success in coordinating continental efforts to prevent severe illness and death from COVID-19; as well as minimizing social and economic disruptions.\nExcellencies,\nWhat we have learnt in the past six months is that no Country and I repeat again no country can manage a crisis of this magnitude, on its own. We have had to work collectively in order to build back better.\nWe, therefore, call upon the global community to enhance cooperation and assistance to developing countries in vulnerable situations so as to bolster their economies and health care systems; and to achieve Universal Health Coverage as envisioned in the 2019 UHC political declaration.\nMr. President,\nThis Assembly is the pinnacle platform for debate on matters of global political concern. At no time in our recent history have global developments been as concerning as they are today.\nGlobal geopolitics and competition between global powers have complicated and severely undermined the global response to the COVID19 pandemic. Indeed, they have caused severe anxiety and undermined coordinated responses to an economic and social character that would have left us in a stronger position as a global collective.\nExcellencies,\nAs President in Office of the Organisation of African, Pacific and Caribbean States, an organization comprising 97 countries, some of whom are most vulnerale and poorest, I have become acutely aware of global geopolitics and competition that is not focused on helping us better build, a stronger, safer, healthier and more prosperous world.\nWhat is equally important is that even after addressing the acute phase of the pandemic, we must all remain collectively committed to global recovery. Developing countries seeking to have the existing debt moratorium refined and extended to December 2021, and an early replenishment of the IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT) and the World Bank International Development Association (IDA) as well as an early decision on the Special Drawing Rights.\nExcellencies,\nI am confident that we have the answers to the challenges we face. The SDGs are a model for multilateral action, which capture the common aspirations of mankind; to end poverty, protect our planet\u2019s biosphere and to ensure prosperity for all.\nThe challenges that confront us today only serve to underscore the need to reaffirm our commitment to the implementation of the SDGs particularly with regard to fighting poverty and inequality; but also our shared responsibility to effectively contribute to this common vision.\nMr. President,\nTurning to Climate Change, I believe Kenya\u2019s stance on Climate Change and the Environment is known to all. Climate Change can unpackage our efforts to attain the SDGs. Kenya acknowledges the disproportionate impacts of climate variability in Small Island Developing States as well as states with fragile ecological environments.\nIn this regard, Kenya was honoured to co host the United Nations Secretary General\u2019s Climate Action Summit in September of last year, which resulted in landmark commitments as well as initiatives.\nSimilarly, the interdependent crisis of the biodiversity loss, an ecosystem degradation requires urgent and collective action. Our global home that was teeming with millions of species of God-given creatures, both great and small, is slowly dying. Kenya once again calls for urgent collective action to halt the decimation of our biodiversity.\nWe must find a global balance between human beings and other creatures on our earth. We must put harmony between people and nature. Our world is yearning for us to stop its ruin! In this regard, we in Kenya look forward to the upcoming Biodiversity Summit that shall be held later.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nAs host to the United Nations Environmental Program, and the UN-Habitat, of which we are proud, Kenya calls for the expansion of the two Programmes\u2019 their viability to harmonize, and to domicile all environmental and human settlements issues, in their rightful place which is at their Headquarters.\nKenya remains committed to continue offering the global community a conducive environment to declare the mandate of these two important UN organizations, UNEP and UN-Habitat.\nLet me also remind all of us, Mr. President, that Kenya and Portugal will co-host the Second UN Ocean Conference in the second quarter of 2021. We welcome you all to participate at the highest level in Lisbon, as we strive to harness science and innovation, to scale up our conservation and the sustainable use of our oceans and blue economy.\nExcellencies,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nLet me pause at this moment to sincerely thank each and everyone of you for electing Kenya to the Security Council for the 2021-2022 term. The vote was an overwhelming affirmation of the trust and confidence that many Members have in Kenya.\nI wish to assure you that Kenya will deliver on our commitments to the Council, under the mandate of the African Union. We will work closely with all member states to ensure that the Council discharges its mandate in an inclusive, responsive and consultative manner because peace is a collective effort.\nMr. President,\nKenya has been a frontline state in global efforts to confront terrorism and violent extremism. We have consistently advocated for the need to build partnerships for a strategic and operational approach to prevent and to combat violent extremism not just here in Kenya or our region but globally.\nAnd even as we struggle with all the other challenges of development and cooperation, we cannot afford to take our eyes off the ever present danger of the existential threat of terrorism.\nKenya was honoured to have hosted the first ever African Regional High-Level Conference on Counterterrorism and Prevention of Violent Extremism in July last year. Kenya also welcomes the envisaged establishment of a UN Counter-Terrorism Programme Office here in Nairobi.\nAs a country that has long contributed to global peace keeping operations, it has been our experience that cooperation among various stakeholders, a clarity of mandate, appropriate training and equipping of troops, an integration of conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peace building measures, the participation especailly of women, as well as the periodic reviews of the effectiveness of missions, greatly strengthens peace keeping operations. Kenya will continue to advocate for inclusive, meaningful triangular consultations between the Security Council, the UN Secretariat and troops and police contributing countries.\nExcellencies,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nEven though the world has made great progress since the creation of this great body, the United Nations 75 years ago, our present challenges may appear dispiriting and the journey ahead seem daunting and arduous. But existence is like a marathon of global proportions.\nI come from a country of marathoners; and I, therefore, appreciate the demands of endurance, teamwork and persistence in conquering the road ahead. Together, I believe we can win this race, mankind can triumph and secure peace and prosperity in a greater biodiversity for present and future generations.\nFinally Mr. President,\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s recent appeal for a global ceasefire also includes a humanitarian call for the roll-back of international sanctions and to reinforce the efforts of vulnerable, fragile and conflict-affected countries, to deal with the impact of COVID-19. I state today that Kenya stands behind this initiative.\nIn this connection, I wish to make a special appeal for an end to the economic and commercial as well as financial embargo against Cuba, sanctions against Zimbabwe and Sudan. The United Nations provides us a platform, a platform to resolve age old differences and unburden ourselves of these antiquated conflicts.\nIt is also Kenya\u2019s desire to see, at this critical and historical juncture, an inspiration for peace between Palestine and Israel.\nKenya calls for renewed and genuine international efforts to find a just and lasting solution to the conflict, based on the existence of two States, the State of Israel and the State of Palestine, within the framework of the relevant United Nations pronouncements.\nI want to thank all of you for your attention. Thank you and God bless you all."

        "file_text": "-\tExcellency Volkan Bozkir, President of the General Assembly,\n-\tExcellency Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary-General,\n-\tExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen!\nThis year\u2019s General Assembly is an exceptional event in the history of the United Nations, not only it is held for the first time virtually via videos, but it takes place during a time when the world is overshadowed by a number of crisis and uncertainties.\nCertainly, the world is facing great turmoil unprecedented in the last 30 years, as a result of the tectonic convergence of a potential New Cold War, which could lead to a profound transformation of the entire geopolitical landscape, the continuous outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, climate and environmental change, non-state terrorism, not to mention the millions of human beings still suffering from hunger, misery and exploitation etc.\nOn top of that, the world is now facing irreversible metamorphose into a Polycentric Structure marked by intense rivalry-turn-adversary between superpowers, parallelly accompanied by the pre-eminence of middle powers moving rapidly to the foreground of regional politics.\nHowever, this year, we are commemorating the 75th anniversary, marking the end of the Second World War, which is an unforgettable event for everyone. In this connection, we have to salute the Founding Fathers of the United Nations, who have laid the groundwork for the modern system of international relations and multilateral engagement, driven by their idealistic desire \u201cto save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind\u201d.\nIn this context, I would like to share my personal views on some topics for discussion in today\u2019s event as follows:\nNew Geopolitical Tensions and Their Impact on the World\nExcellency President!\nThe longest period of stability and prosperity in modern times, a fruit born out of the international order built in 1945, is being deeply shaken because the fundamental values underlying it as well as the core principles of international law are being flouted and no longer respected. Moreover, the trend of unilateralism and the exertion of force against weak countries is on the rise, undermining international order and multilateralism.\nTruly, nowadays we note the degradation of the international arms control system and a significant increase in nuclear risks. Also, there has been an alarming shift in doctrinal military and political policies towards the idea of waging war as a mean to maintain one\u2019s own supremacy, which is an unacceptable act. For instance, global commitments made are unilaterally reneged; violent blows are levelled against international institutions; and the voices of reason are stifled by the arbitrary practice of unilateral sanctions and other coercive political, economic and financial measures, all because of the strongest country uphold their interests above everything else.\nFurthermore, there is an abusive use of the right of interference, which has taken on such a proportion that it undermines one of the fundamental principles of our UN Charter: the right of peoples to self-determination and the national sovereignty. The damages on the current international order are causes for great concern. In addition, the possibility of a so-called New Cold War has also become a significant concern because this small country, once caught in the midst of the Cold War conflict, ideological rift and nationalist fanatism, paid a very high price. Thus, we must outright reject any attempt to allow tragic history to repeat itself.\nCovid-19 Pandemic, Economic and Social Recovery\nExcellency President!\nNever, in our history, has a health crisis had effects and consequences of this magnitude. Although we have yet to grasp the full impact of the pandemic on the world economies, we can anticipate the gloomy prospect of business bankruptcies and massive layoffs, which have been affecting the lives of millions of people.\nParadoxically, the pandemic has reminded us of the indispensable solidarity that unites the people of the world. For the world economy to recover faster, we must work more closely to address this crisis through international institutions based on the principles of transparency and efficiency. Now more than ever, we must renounce the inward looking \u201cMe First\u201d attitude, which is the very negation of the universality of the human values. Cambodia has shown its humanitarian gesture early this year, when the MS Westerdam cruise ship, floating at sea with no port to anchor, was allowed to dock in our port, thus allowing the stranded passengers and the crew safe passage to their respective country.\nGlobal Issues and Challenges\nExcellency President!\nNow, I would like to raise key global issues and challenges, starting with the effects of the pandemic on Sustainable Development Goals.\nLooking at the global economies which have severely been hit by the COVID 19, my worries are particularly related to the compounding effects on the resources to deliver on the key priorities necessary to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda on time, and this may require us to re-evaluate the feasibility of achieving the goals set in the past.\nClimate change is another matter of great concern. Global C02 emissions have increased by 1.5% per year over the past ten years. 75 per cent of the Earth\u2019s environment shows significant signs of degradation by plastics, pesticides, nitrates, and heavy metals. As scary as these statistics show, it is mind-boggling to note that not many countries have done enough to meet their respective COP21 commitments.\nCambodia is a small country with limited resources, but we strive to address the challenges related to climate change, under both national and international frameworks. For instance, we have taken efforts to meet the obligations born of the COP21: climate change action is a key component of our national development policy.\nIn fact, we will update our Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) for the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) ahead of the COP26 meeting in Glasgow.\nNon-State Terrorism and Peacekeeping Operations\nExcellency President!\nNext, let me now shift to two other important issues related to peace and security, namely non-state terrorism and peacekeeping operations.\nIn my view, it would be a very serious mistake to brush aside the threat of non state terrorism, in the mere hope that it would go away by itself. We have to admit that the root causes of this religious radicalism, or for that matter for all forms of radicalism, have yet to be addressed. In fact, all forms of radicalism or violent extremism stem from a deep sense of social injustice, based on discrimination on gender, language, skin color, beliefs or origins. Moreover, there remain other critical threats to the peace and security all around the world.\nIn this context, Cambodia is proud of our peacekeeping contributions throughout the years under the UN umbrella. As of now, there are nearly 800 Cambodian blue helmets, of which 10 per cent are women, serving in Sudan, South Sudan, Lebanon, Mali and Central African Republic.\nOn this 75th anniversary of the UN, we must honor all those brave persons, including the Cambodians, who have given their lives for the noble cause of contributing to a better and more peaceful world. Cambodia remains committed, today as ever, to continue our peacekeeping efforts with a view to promoting peace and development for all. Cambodia counts nevertheless on the UN to provide adequate resources, regular trainings in pre- and post-deployments, and continuous supports to the Peacekeeping Operations to enable them to deliver on their mandate fully, efficiently and safely.\nDenouncing the injustice\nExcellency President!\nAs a peace-loving small country committed to democratic principles, Cambodia can play its part in the international community only if it is assured that the rules governing the international system are fairly applied. Unfortunately, all too often, depending on the political ambition and hidden opportunistic agenda of some countries, Cambodia had to deal with hypocritical double standards, biased and politically motivated decisions; in short, injustice.\nThis story of injustice reminds me of a historical \u201cdeja vu\u201d.A little more than 40 years ago, Cambodia was liberated from the Khmer Rouges\u2019 genocidal regime, where more than 2 million Cambodians have perished in the hand of the barbaric regime. For many years, the traumatized and exhausted survivors, totally stripped of everything, had to rebuild the nation from scratch. Quite ironically, it was to these very same survivors who were being punished by a majority of UN member states while allowing the Khmer Rouge executioners to occupy the Cambodian seat in the UN. These same governments that preached incessantly about democracy and human rights were the ones that have deprived the entire surviving population access to food, health, education, housing, development and even peace for 12 long years.\nI believe history repeats itself in the case of the EU\u2019s withdrawal of the EBA at a time when Cambodia struggles to survive amid the COVID-19 pandemic. That struggle notwithstanding, Cambodia is strongly determined, as it did 40 years ago, to defend what it believes is the rightful path, that is to defend our sovereignty and to protect our so hard-won peace, which is fully cherished by Cambodians who have gone through the most tragic devastation and are now rising as a nation be on an equal footing, status and rights with other nations in the region and the world.\nExcellency President!\nIn conclusion, let me state outright that our world is in trouble. People are suffering and the planet is suffering. Major challenges are ahead of us and yet some countries have been shirking themselves from their own responsibilities. Ultimately, it is up to the most powerful country to stop threatening world peace and the survival of the planet as much as it is up to the super and middle powers to work together to ensure a new world order based on the respect of the sovereignty of others and their peaceful coexistence.\nThank You!"

        "file_text": "Bismilliah ah Rahmaan ah raheem\nMr President, Mr Secretary-General, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen\nCongratulations Mr President, on your election as the President of the seventy- fifth session of the UN General Assembly. A distinguished person of your wisdom and caliber at the helm of this assembly brings comfort, during these extraordinary times we face.\nI also wish to express our heartfelt appreciation to the outgoing President for his excellent stewardship of our work through unforeseen challenges.\nMr. Secretary-General, my country applauds your sincere and hard work during these tiring times.\n\u201cA handful though we are, we dedicate ourselves to the principles of\nthis world body and declare our faith in the support of the Charter of the\nUnited Nations\u201d.\nMr President,\nThese were among the first words that the first Permanent Representative of the Maldives to the United Nations Mr Ahmed Hilmy Didi spoke at this chamber, 55 years ago. 55 years ago, we declared our firm conviction that \u201cthe UN is the chief architect\u201d of peace. 55 years later, our conviction remains stronger than ever.\nToday, as we grapple with one of the greatest global challenges in recent history, deliberating \u201cthe future we want, the United Nations we need\u201d and \u201creaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism\u201d not only seems opportune but a necessity.\nThe stark and tragic images of the Covidl9 pandemic still remain etched in our minds. Healthcare workers treating patients on makeshift beds. Undertakers struggling to bury the dead. Empty roads, empty schools, empty airports. And the eerie silence blanketing it all...\nIn the Maldives \u2014 a vibrant and thriving nation \u2014 our lives, came to a standstill, almost overnight. With no tourists, revenue declined, and debt increased. The economy is set to contract \u2014 for the first time in a decade.\nResponding quickly to the Covidl9 health impacts was our first priority. We immediately declared a National Health Emergency. President Solih established the National Emergency Operations Center, and chaired the Committee\u2019s meetings himself. We boosted testing capacity, established Covid treatment facilities, mobilised and trained healthcare workers. The dedication of our frontline workers in ensuring effective provision of quality healthcare, and uninterrupted services has been extraordinary.\nOur second priority was to minimise shock to the economy, and support households and businesses. Income support, stimulus packages, debt moratorium, and tax reliefs programs have been initiated; Social security including universal health insurance, single parent support and elderly pensions, have continued despite many logistical and financial challenges.\nA National Taskforce on Response and Recovery has been constituted, and it has prioritised building resilience into our post Covid action plan. The aim is to ensure that the development gains we have made over the past decades are not eroded; to ensure that development projects promised and planned go forward without delay; and to ensure that our commitment to the 2030 Agenda, ensuring that no one is left behind, does not remain unfulfilled.\nMr President,\nThere are many lessons that can already be learnt from Covidl9.\nFirst, the asymmetries in the international system have been laid bare like never before \u2014 whether it be the unevenness of the impacts, the digital divide, the deep shocks due to disruptions in supply chains \u2014 no country has been spared from the impacts. But not every country has been affected in equal measure. In countries like mine, where tourism contributions both directly and indirectly account for 75% of GDP, the loss has been immeasurable.\nSecond, the toll that debt burdens have on the economies of Small Island Developing States like the Maldives is clearer now. We appreciate the G20\u2019s debt service suspension initiative. But there is little difference between 31 December and 1 January, apart from the change in year. Economies will still be in recovery, and hurting. So, we request the G20 to extend their initiative until the end of 2021.\nBut, debt suspension is only half the story for SIDS. We need structural change, innovative facilities, and better and greater access to concessional financing. We need a proper assessment of our vulnerabilities that will shape the way for better- targeted approaches in SIDS.\nThird, the pandemic has also highlighted the importance of global cooperation. In the Maldives, without the support of our friends, our bilateral and multilateral partners, we would not be able to continue weathering this storm. As we work towards finding a vaccine, our hope is that every person who needs it will have access to it. That we will work together to ensure equitable access.\nI thank all our partners who have generously extended financial, material and technical support during this crisis, even when they themselves are going through challenging times. One such example is India. The recent budget support of 250 million US dollars, was the single largest financial assistance from a donor during this pandemic.\nMr President,\nThe Covid pandemic has given us the opportunity to recalibrate our approach to development, and focus on building a more resilient world \u2014 one that delivers for planet, people, and prosperity.\nFor countries like mine \u2014 climate change remains a significant threat \u2014 but also a threat that is difficult to overcome on our own. The number of islands that require emergency shore protection, flood or disaster relief are rising each year. The frequency, and severity of the events are pushing towards the limits of adaptation. There is also an increasing trend on the slow-onset events such as sea level rise. For the Maldives, the impacts of climate change are no longer the future. For us, it is our lived reality.\nBut climate change does not discriminate. It does not recognise borders. Big or small, rich or poor, every nation is facing the impacts, although at different scales and magnitudes. Climate change is a risk multiplier. It continues to be a threat to international security.\nOur hope is in realising the lofty ambitions of the Paris Agreement. What we need is stronger NDCs by all countries. We will most certainly submit ours! We need actual realisation of pledges made, including financial commitments. We need easier, and faster access to finance. Climate financing has to be new, additional and predictable in nature, and rolled out now, to achieve the target we set in 2015. Adaptation is no longer something to plan for, in the future. It is our every day.\nAs we rebuild our economies after COVID-19, it must not be business as usual. We have to use this as an opportunity to build back greener. In doing so, no country should be left alone. This is another opportunity to reduce emissions to keep global temperature rise below 1.5\u00b0 Celsius. Let us make the road to Glasgow, one that is paved with meaningful action that includes all.\nMeaningful action is also required towards the protection of our ocean. Millions of people rely on the ocean and its bounty, for their survival. For Maldivians, as custodians of over 90,000 square kilometers of the Indian Ocean, it is part of our identity, our way of life, our economy.\nThis is why protecting the ocean from the harmful impacts of marine plastic pollution is crucial for us, and many other countries like us. President Solih announced here at the GA last year, our pledge to phase out single use plastics by 2023. We continue to work with like-minded countries for an effective international framework to this end. We have committed to the protection of 20 per cent of our own waters and are also committed to working with the Global Ocean Alliance towards achieving the global target of protecting 30 per cent of the ocean in the coming years.\nFriends, it is our shared responsibility to preserve, and sustainably use, the ocean and all of its bounty. Let us not fail. Not on our watch!\nMr President,\nEnsuring human rights is fundamental to a progressive society, and sustainable development. The promotion and protection of human rights is a cornerstone of President Solih\u2019s administration from its inception.\nOf the core human rights Conventions, Maldives has ratified seven, and withdrawn several of the reservations to CEDAW. We will also ratify the Convention on Enforced Disappearances in the coming months. The Child Rights Protection Act, and the Juvenile Justice Act are recent examples of our efforts to align our legal instruments with international obligations.\nWe have also ratified the Third Optional Protocol to CRC, and signed the Declaration under Article 22 of the Convention Against Torture, allowing for enhanced access to justice.\nWe firmly believe that a rights-based approach prioritises the empowerment of all segments of society \u2014 especially women and youth. For the first time, the Government is working on a draft Youth Bill that will identify and ensure the rights of young people, including their participation in decision-making. A multi-dimensional, holistic approach that includes leadership, political participation, gender equality, counter-radicalisation, health and wellbeing, guides our youth policies.\nMainstreaming gender equality in society, and in public life, is an ongoing process \u2014 a process that no country has completed. As we move towards marking the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women, every effort must be made to reaching the vision of Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. In the Maldives, several steps have been taken in the right direction. For example, recent amendments brought to Local Councils Act allocated a third of all local council seats to women, ensuring their participation in the decentralised goverance system. I am also proud to announce that we have achieved gender parity among Heads of Missions of the Maldives Foreign Service.\nIt is because of the importance the Maldives places on the promotion and protection of human rights that the Government has taken the decision to present its candidature for the Human Rights Council for the term 2023-2025. We believe that domestic and global efforts to promote and protect human rights go hand-in-hand. And as a Small, Island State, we wish to share the unique experiences of our efforts to align our laws, and cultivate a culture of respect for human rights.\nMr President,\nTerrorism remains one of the most complex and challenging global issues of our time \u2014 one that requires cooperation, coordination, and also consensus. We have to work together to address the root causes of terrorism and violent extremism, especially in light of advances in social media and digital technology.\nThe global community also has to work together to ensure the rights of the Palestinian people. For decades, Palestinians have cried out for dignity, respect, and statehood \u2014 to no avail. We reiterate our call for a two State solution on the basis of the pre-1967 borders with East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine.\nThe Rohingya people continue to endure extreme deprivation and hardships. We will not standby and stand witness to genocide. We will do all we can to challenge the mistreatment, displacement and wanton killing of the Rohingya people. We will continue to advocate on their behalf, including at the International Court of Justice.\nMr President,\nAs the UN celebrates 75 years in existence, there is much to celebrate, and be thankful for. The UN helped shape an international order following years of warfare, and strife. The UN gave the world a platform to share its problems and prepare solutions. The UN gave countries like mine \u2014 the smallest of the smallest \u2014 an equal voice, a place at the table, the ability to contribute, and to make a difference. It remains the best hope for the security of small States like mine.\nYes, we all agree that the UN needs reform, to come to terms with the current membership and the current times. But we cannot dispute that the UN is still necessary. The UN still presents the best hope for humanity, the best opportunity for cooperation, the best platform for dialogue, the best check against rising tide of ultra-nationalism, and xenophobia.\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nWe must once again come together, determined to uphold peace, preserve fundamental human rights, human dignity, and the worth of every person, and every nation large and small.\nWe must once again, commit to practise tolerance, promote dialogue over war, and employ global cooperation for the advancement of all people.\nWe must once again, come together, resolute in our commitment to the principles of the UN, to revive the true spirit of multilateralism, to herald in a truly just and happier world.\nMr President, \u201cA handful though we are\u201d \u2014 the Maldives stands ready to do our part \u2014just as we did 55 years ago!\nI thank you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nIt is an honour to address this august Assembly of States, on this milestone, the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. Allow me at the outset, to extend congratulations to you, Mr. President, on behalf of the Government and People of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, on your election as President for this Session. You have the full support of Trinidad and Tobago, as we acknowledge the enormity of your undertaking, especially as we continue to grapple with a global pandemic which has affected us all.\nI also wish to express our deepest gratitude to your predecessor, His Excellency Professor Tijani Muhammad-Bande for his astute leadership in the 74th session and for successfully guiding the work of the session during the challenging onset of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus pandemic.\nMr. President,\nSeventy-five years ago, in the aftermath of the Second World War, the United Nations was created, with the primary objective of saving \u201csucceeding generations from the scourge of war, which had twice in our lifetime brought untold sorrow to mankind.\u201d Undoubtedly, the desire to create the political, social and economic conditions for lasting peace remains as fervent today as it was during the organisation\u2019s genesis in San Francisco. The 75th anniversary of the United Nations presents an ideal opportunity for reflection and introspection on whether we have embraced the opportunities to re-engineer and reinvigorate the mechanisms of multilateralism, to engender the peace, which has so far remained elusive, to advance social progress and to chart the way forward to attain sustainable development, which would benefit all of humanity.\nMr President,\nTrinidad and Tobago joined this family of nations in 1962, the year we attained our independence. As a Small Island Developing State, we continue to embrace the principle of collective security enshrined in the Charter as a major safeguard for Small States, where the rule of law, in the absence of military and economic power, sustains their strength and sovereignty. As we mark this 75th anniversary of the United Nations, all States, small and large, can be reasonably proud of some of our achievements under the umbrella of this revered organisation, such as the creation of a roadmap for global sustainable development, advances in the development of international law and the promotion of gender equality.\nThroughout the 75 years of the existence of the United Nations, the common thread in the tapestry of our collective action is the recognition that global challenges can best be overcome through the practice of multilateralism based on mutual respect and trust. Now more than ever is the time to demonstrate that true spirit of global partnership and a reaffirmation of the rules-based commitments.\nMr. President,\nIt is in this context, that I congratulate you on the aptly chosen theme for this 75th session and I welcome the opportunity to address this Assembly and share our perspectives on \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism-confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action.\u201d Small nations like ours as well as big nations anticipate and even depend on us all sharing and caring for each other.\nMr. President,\nLike many other Small Island Developing States (SIDS) around the world contending with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Trinidad and Tobago has had to walk a thin line between saving lives and preserving livelihoods, with limited resources. As a Government, we took the decision to close our borders in March this year, to temporarily halt the conduct of non-essential services and to implement physical distancing requirements, all in an effort to prevent the importation and spread of the virus. Subsequently, additional measures were implemented to the approach to safeguarding the population. Relevant adjustments were also made to address the impending economic consequences to protect the most vulnerable in our society, who would have temporarily lost the wherewithal to support themselves. Our experience thus far bears eloquent testimony of the need for Small Island Developing States to be supported by an enabling international economic environment through business activity and financing, international trade, as well as technical cooperation and, most importantly, multilateralism.\nMr. President,\nI take the opportunity to convey my condolences to and express my solidarity with all Member States and all the families of those who have lost loved ones due to the COVID-19 global pandemic. While we mourn the loss of the hundreds of thousands of persons worldwide, to COVID-19, we are greatly concerned with the alarming rate at which the disease continues to affect millions across the globe.\nMr. President,\nTrinidad and Tobago commends the leadership role demonstrated by the World Health Organization (WHO) in spearheading the efforts to treat with this plague. We also wish to salute and commend the health care and other frontline workers around the world who continue to work tirelessly, sometimes at significant personal sacrifice, to ensure that those affected by the pandemic receive the best available care.\nMr. President,\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presents an existential threat of unmatched proportions to human health and safety around the world. It has overwhelmed health sectors, disturbed global trade and food supply chains, crushed the travel and leisure industry as well as disrupt the basic livelihoods of people around the world. Alarmingly the pandemic has intensified the vulnerabilities of small economies and has rendered us more susceptible to exogenous shocks. Further, COVID-19 has threatened to reverse the gains, which our societies have achieved towards attaining our sustainable development goal (SDG) targets.\nOur prospects for achieving sustainable development hinge heavily on the safety and security of our people. The global pandemic has unfortunately exacerbated the threats posed by the illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons, piracy, trafficking in persons and cybercrimes. Given our ardent desire to free our society from the effects of the prevalence of unregulated small arms and light weapons, Trinidad and Tobago remains fully committed to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) which we view as indispensable in addressing the menace of the illicit arms trade.\nAs one of the most multi-ethnic and diverse societies in the world, Trinidad and Tobago is cognisant of the value of diversity, mutual respect and the right to live in freedom without fear of persecution. Regrettably, some parts of the world are still afflicted by the absence of tolerance for human rights, dignity and diversity, which has engendered war crimes, crimes of aggression, crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity. Trinidad and Tobago in this regard attaches great importance and remains unwavering in its support of the mandate of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which was established to hold those who commit such heinous crimes accountable under international law and to act as a deterrent to would-be perpetrators. We therefore continue to urge those States, which have not yet done so, to support the ICC.\nMr. President,\nThe first Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, Dr. Eric Williams, declared, \u201cThe future of our nation is in our children\u2019s school bags\u201d. That declaration remains valid to this day and in our country, it is universally accepted that education is the key to success. It is therefore in our best interest to ensure that our nation\u2019s children have both the opportunity and the necessary tools to fulfill their highest potential.\nThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago remains attentive to the needs of all our children, with special emphasis on those who are most affected by this pandemic, such as those living in extreme poverty, those suffering from mental health ailments, those with special needs and those who have lost loved ones. As we navigate through these challenging times, we remain committed to ensuring that no child is left behind in our campaign to \u201cbuild back better\u201d.\nMr. President,\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated my Government\u2019s thrust towards a digital transformation of the public sector. As we adjust to the new normal, we have quickly adapted to utilising remote platforms for conducting business instead of the traditional in-person meetings. We are optimistic that our greater reliance on digital platforms will result in opportunities for our young people in fields related to cyber technology and cyber security.\nMr. President,\nIt is widely acknowledged that climate change is a threat to our very existence. We are also cognisant that this pernicious threat does not recognise geographical boundaries and will disproportionately impact developing countries, particularly Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs). As a Small Island Developing State, Trinidad and Tobago remains at high risk of being affected by the harmful effects of climate change which have already been manifested in coastal erosion resulting from the rise in sea level. In this regard, our country continues to place emphasis on multi-pronged approaches for future adaptation to and mitigation of climate change, within the constraints of our limited financial capability. We therefore remain committed to achieving our sustainable development through a combination of collaborative approaches and improved partnerships with stakeholders.\nMr. President,\nThe COVID-19 pandemic coupled with the significant decreases in energy prices has precipitated the acceleration of our efforts aimed at the diversification of our economy. In this respect, we have allocated resources and increased investment in the agricultural and tourism sectors as we recognise the need to build resilience in these areas through incentives, policies, programmes and public private partnerships. Additionally, engendering investment in agriculture will inevitably lead to a reduction in the demand for certain imported foods, preservation of our limited financial resources and the achievement of a more food-secure nation. We will also continue to encourage the participation of women in agri-business, agriculture and tourism as we remain seized of the fact that women not only undertake the role of ensuring that their families receive the nutrition they need to be healthy but are sometimes the breadwinners.\nIn this regard, the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), has cautioned that a debt crisis is looming for the economies of the Latin American and Caribbean subregion, which will compound their high debt to GDP and debt service ratios. Despite the middle and upper-income status of many economies in the region, a strong case exists that these countries are deserving of special consideration for debt relief. We strongly urge the international community to assist with the financial support needed by developing countries, including middle- income countries like Trinidad and Tobago, to meet their development commitments.\nThe promotion of gender equity and equality is a priority in our National Development Strategy. As a country, we have also remained unwavering in our commitment to the effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and have submitted our country\u2019s progress report this year on the twenty- fifth (25th) anniversary of the Declaration. In recognition of the phenomenal contribution of women to peace and development, we are particularly proud to highlight the tenth anniversary of the introduction and main sponsorship by Trinidad and Tobago of the United Nations General Assembly Resolution on \u2018Women, Disarmament, Nonproliferation and Arms Control.\u2019\nMr. President,\nThe marine environment and its resources remain critical to the livelihood of the people of Trinidad and Tobago, and to our sustainable development. Governance of our oceans continues to be a priority. Unfortunately, as a result of the global pandemic, the fourth session of the Intergovernmental Conference on an International Legally Binding Instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction, had to be postponed. Given the critical stage of the negotiations, Trinidad and Tobago remains hopeful for its early resumption, the successful completion of which would redound to the benefit of all humankind.\nMr. President,\nTrinidad and Tobago continues to support the reform of the Security Council. We are firm in our view that this will improve significantly the global ability to effectively respond to the various security and other challenges, which currently confront the international community. While we acknowledge that in its seventy-five- year history the United Nations has succeeded in preventing another global war, peace remains out of reach in some parts of the world. In order to be effective, we believe that the United Nations must adapt to the ever-changing geopolitical environment and that the Security Council ought to reflect the diversity that characterises and truly represents the United Nations.\nAs we begin the Decade of Action and Delivery to implement the Sustainable Development Goals it is important to ensure that no country is left behind. It is on this note that we maintain that the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba, undermines the country\u2019s potential to achieve sustainable development. To this end, Trinidad and Tobago reiterates its call for the unconditional lifting of the economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba. We have noted that despite the blockade, the Government of Cuba has demonstrated the true spirit of multilateralism by providing health care personnel to assist countries in different regions of the world in their fight against COVID-19. We commend and thank the Government and People of Cuba for this humanitarian gesture.\nIn furtherance of this same spirit we ask the Member nations of the UN to continue to support the CARICOM initiatives, encouraged by Norway and Barbados, to bring all elements in Venezuela to accept dialogue and human rights as their guiding lights as we look forward to fair and peaceful elections there in the near future and trust that a satisfactory outcome would lead to a resumption of normalcy in our Caribbean shores as we all aspire together to achieve together in this region.\nMr. President,\nAs the United Nations commemorates its 75th anniversary, it is indeed opportune to reaffirm its founders\u2019 guiding vision as enshrined in the Charter and to rededicate ourselves to be steadfast in our joint pursuit of the goals of upholding Human Rights, Development, Peace and Security. However, as we assess the performance and impact of the United Nations and the road we have travelled, we must also look ahead to the next phase in the life of our organization, given the many challenges which confront our global community. I am confident that by working together we can achieve success.\nMr President,\nMembers all, I thank you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nYour Excellencies,\nDistinguished Ladies and Gentlemen,\nI am honoured to address this 75th United Nations General Assembly for the first time since the renewal of my mandate as President of the Republic of Botswana at our General Elections, held on 23 October 2019.\nThis Assembly is unique in many ways. It marks the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations, it is virtual, and it is held against the backdrop of the greatest challenge of our time, the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAllow me therefore, to extend our heartfelt condolences and sympathies to families and friends, throughout the world, who have been affected by the pandemic. I also pay special tribute to all those in the frontline of this battle.\nI am confident that, like other challenges before, we will, together put up a spirited fight against it and emerge wiser, stronger and more resilient in our preparedness to deal with similar pandemics.\nMr. President,\nI join other delegations that have spoken before me in congratulating you on your assumption of the Presidency of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. We welcome the priorities you presented, and pledge my delegation\u2019s full support in the execution of your mandate.\nLet me also take this opportunity to extend our profound gratitude to your predecessor, His Excellency Professor Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, for his stewardship of the General Assembly during its 74th Session.\nMr. President,\nBotswana endorses the theme of this General Assembly Session: \u201cThe Future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism \u2014 confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action.\u201d\nThis theme is a timely reminder of the value and significance of multilateralism as the ultimate framework through which everlasting solutions to existing and emerging global challenges can be attained. Indeed, the world is a much safer and secure place when our nations work together towards collective responses to the complex threats of our time.\nNow, more than ever before, multilateral action is needed to effectively respond to an urgent global public health crisis of a kind which has not been seen since the Spanish Flu of 1918.\nWe can all agree, that our collective cooperation will be required to repair our nations\u2019 devastated economies and restore the livelihoods of our societies.\nAs the foremost multilateral institution, the United Nations and its most noticable specialised agency; the World Health Organisation (WHO), are better suited to mobilise action relating to immediate and long-term responses to the COVID 19 pandemic.\nWe have, without a doubt, seen the organisation move swiftly to support national response efforts in vulnerable parts of the world. Most noticeably were the UN \u201cSolidarity flights\u201d that delivered life-saving medical supplies to the neediest around the world.\nMy delegation welcomes the initiatives and urgent response measures undertaken by the UN System, especially the support rendered, through the UN Country Teams, to this global crisis.\nWe particularly appreciate the leadership provided by the UN Secretary- General during this unprecedented time, particularly his call for a global ceasefire, as well as an affordable COVID-19 vaccine that will be accessed by \u201cevery person, everywhere.\u201d\nMr. President,\nAs we reflect on how to effectively leverage on multilateralism and international cooperation to better tackle the challenges exposed by COVID-19, it is incumbent upon us to also further examine the ways to strengthen the UN\u2019s response capacities.\nIn doing so, we should also seize the opportunity to re-double our ambition towards attainment of the 2030 Agenda; the future we want. We should galvanize momentum to accelerate SDGs implementation by building on the Secretary General\u2019s wise call for a \u201cDecade of Action\u201d.\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\nMr. President,\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), constitute a firm blueprint that should continue to guide us in our global and national plans.\nWe in Botswana remain committed to accelerate our efforts towards the attainment of SDGs during this remaining \u2018Decade of Action.\u2019\nTo realize this ambition, my Government is resolute in the transformation of Botswana\u2019s economy from one that largely relies on the extractive industry, which is vulnerable to globe shocks, to a knowledge-based economy.\nTo this end, my Government has introduced economic policy reforms to stimulate and fast-track transformation in many sectors. These actions are aimed at creating an enabling environment for private sector development in pursuit of Goal 8, that is, Decent work and Economic Growth.\nMr. President\nAs I alluded, in Botswana, like in many countries, the pandemic has had far-reaching impact on our lives and livelihoods.\nFor our already vulnerable health sector, the pandemic joins a list of challenges, which include: child mortality; non communicable diseases; and HIV and AIDS.\nIn responding to the escalating rate of Non-Communicable Diseases, my Government has adopted the Multi-sectoral strategy for Prevention and Control of NCDs for 2018-2023. The strategy focuses on prevention measures and enhancing the quality of life for those affected.\nOur longstanding battle against HIV and AIDS remains a key priority for my Government. In this context, I am happy to inform that Botswana is well on track to achieve the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS 90-90-90 UNAIDS\u2019s treatment target. So far, 86 per cent of people living with HIV have tested and know their status. And of those who know, 83 per cent are on treatment and 90 per cent are virally suppressed.\nMr. President\nBotswana is accelerating access to inclusive, equitable quality education through, amongst other interventions, the implementation of the Education and Training Sector Strategic Plan. The ETSSP, as it\u2019s commonly known, aims to transform learning by ensuring access, retention, and promoting life-long learning and skills development.\nPoverty Eradication\nMr. President\nIt is noted that before the pandemic, an estimated 783 million people were living in extreme poverty globally. However, as at June 2020, the World Bank projected that the pandemic could push an additional 71 million people into extreme poverty in 2020, therefore reversing the gains made in recent decades.\nCertainly, this turn of events demands our urgent collective action if we are to eradicate poverty in all its multi-dimensional forms everywhere, and for everyone affected, by 2030.\nFor its part, my Government will continue to empower and uplift the poor through a variety of the poverty eradication programmes. These programmes equip and enable beneficiaries to start micro and small scale enterprises for better survival. Such programmes have uplifted beneficiaries from poverty through sustainable income generation, creation and sustenance.\nMr. President,\nMy delegation notes the unfortunate global increase in violence against women and girls amid the current health crisis. As countries went into lockdowns and people stayed home, many women and girls, regrettably, became an easy target of human predators and were subjected to Gender Based Violence (GBV). This trend goes against the aspirations of Goal 5: Gender Equality and requires our strenuous and collective action.\nWhile the GBV scourge had already been a concern in Botswana, it increased alarmingly during the COVID-19 crisis. To address this problem, my Government has intensified the implementation of the National Strategy towards Ending Gender Based Violence.\nBotswana\u2019s Response to COVID-19\nMr. President,\nAs I stated, COVID-19 has been detrimental to Botswana\u2019s economy. The suspension of international travel and the global economic meltdown have dealt a heavy blow on the two mainstays of our economy; tourism and diamond mining. The repeated lockdowns and other COVID-19 protocols have also significantly reduced economic activity.\nIn its response, my Government availed an economic relief package to support the economy and complement disease containment measures.\nThe Government is now working on an \u201cEconomic Recovery and Transformation Plan\u201d that is intended to support the restoration of economic activity; facilitate economic growth; accelerate economic transformation; and build a resilient of the economy.\nWhereas our economy has been disrupted, Government remains strongly committed to its pre-COVID-19 sustainable development-oriented policies and programs. The Economic Recovery and Transformation Plan will thus add impetus to implementation of these initiatives.\nCOVID-19 and Multilateral Action\nMr. President,\nAs is evident with any global problem, Nation-States do not have the capacity to address the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects, on their own. A multilateral response is without question, imperative. We therefore echo the call for a rule based and inclusive multilateralism that is open to the voices of civil society, the private sector, and academia as key stakeholders and partners, in shaping the global response.\nFor Botswana, an ideal multilateral response will be one that has short and long-term perspectives. In the short-term, there is a need to provide immediate relief and safety nets to vulnerable countries and peoples. For the long term, post COVID 19 recovery multilateral efforts are needed to provide comprehensive support to the most vulnerable countries and populations.\nMy delegation thus welcomes the idea of a recovery that is focused on building back better, faster and even greener and fostering resilience. This is ever so critical for countries emerging from conflict and other humanitarian crises, as well as those still living under unfortunate conditions of foreign occupation.\nOf keen interest to Botswana will also be support given to countries in special situations such as Least Developed Countries; Landlocked Developing Countries; and Small Island Developing States as the most vulnerable category of United Nations Member States. Being a landlocked country, Botswana has, during this pandemic experienced some challenges with cross-border movement of goods and services due to border closures.\nIn this context, we call for an accelerated effort in the implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action, the Istanbul Program of Action and the SAMOA Pathway, which are designed to ameliorate the challenges faced by these groups of countries.\nFor the UN\u2019s multilateral framework to be effective in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic and other challenges, we need a United Nations that is nimble, agile and fit for purpose. Indeed, since the crisis started, we have seen the Secretariat demonstrating these organisational qualities in its response.\nThough the jury is still out on the reforms, my delegation observes that the Management Reforms have brought about some improvements to the organisation\u2019s crisis response. We nonetheless believe more remains to be done, and we encourage the General Assembly and other principal organs to step up their own reform efforts.\nClimate Change\nMr. President,\nWhile COVID-19 is a devastating pandemic, which caught the world unaware and ill-prepared, Climate Change is a phenomenon we are well aware of, and can mitigate against its repercussions. We long declared Climate Change an existential threat, and committed to restrain its rapid devastation. We should therefore re-double our efforts to mitigate its negative effects.\nBotswana, a semi-arid country with erratic rainfall and frequent droughts, attaches great importance to Goal 13 (Climate Action). These climatic conditions affect livelihoods by impeding food production. Moreover, recent droughts have resulted in the drying up of water sources including for wildlife. This has contributed to animal deaths and the escalation of the human-wildlife conflict.\nIn order to strengthen mitigation and adaptation, my Government is developing a Climate Change Response Policy and a National Adaptation Plan. Working with civil society, academia, and international partners, we are accelerating our implementation of our commitments under the Paris Agreement.\nHuman Rights\nMr. President,\nBotswana fully subscribes to the three mutually reinforcing pillars upon which the United Nations was founded. We hold firm that the promotion and protection of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law are critical to sustainable development, peace and security.\nMr President,\nI also wish to take this occasion to reaffirm Botswana\u2019s support for the Human Rights Council on its extensive work in adopting outcomes that advance the global human rights agenda.\nInternational Peace and Security\nMr. President,\nMy delegation applauds the United Nation\u2019s continued efforts to maintain global peace and security in the midst of a pandemic. We welcome the Secretary- General\u2019s Appeal for Global Ceasefire and its intended effort of halting armed conflict to allow the world to focus on the more pressing and bigger battle against the pandemic.\nAlso commendable is the COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan which is designed to provide relief to the most vulnerable groups particularly in conflict affected and low income countries. There is however a need for partnerships and more donor funding for the effective operationalisation of this important plan.\nMr. President,\nTurning now to peace and stability in the Southern African region, I note that while it remains relatively stable, there is an emerging threat to peace and security, due to increasing acts of terrorism and insurgency.\nAs the current Chair of the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security Cooperation, Botswana is committed to ensure that close attention is given to the imperative to combat terrorism and other security threats in order to enhance peace and stability in the SADC region.\nMr. President,\nIt has been indisputably established that terrorism knows no borders. It remains a serious threat to international peace and security. Essentially, Botswana remains deeply committed to combating terrorism in all its forms. We thus continue to take the necessary steps to prevent and combat this scourge. This includes the strengthening our Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing regime. This is testimony to our firm commitment to contribute towards bolstering the integrity and security of the global financial system.\nWe appreciate the support provided by the United Nations Office for Counter- Terrorism and other partners, to enhance the capacity of Botswana\u2019s newly established Counter Terrorism Analysis and Fusion Agency in order to enable us to mitigate the exposure to this menace.\nIn conclusion, I wish to reaffirm Botswana\u2019s commitment to, and belief in multilateralism and international cooperation as an indispensable mechanism for fostering peace and security, promoting human rights and sustainable development.\nIt is beyond the shadow of doubt that the United Nations remains more relevant now than it was 75 years ago. This is in view of the complex and multi-faceted challenges confronting humanity today.\nInevitably, the lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic and many others, will become a key determinant of the model of the real future we want and the United Nations we need to recover faster and build a more peaceful, just, and prosperous world for the future generation!\nI thank you for your attention."

        "file_text": "It is a great honour for me to speak at the general debate of the General Assembly at its seventy-fifth session for the first time, as Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Guatemala on behalf of President Alejandro Giammattei Falla.\nMy country highlights the importance of the central theme of our deliberations and acknowledges the focus on our collective commitment to multilateralism and confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action.\nI join others in expressing our condolences to the families of all those who have lost loved ones as a result the terrible consequences of COVID-19. I appreciate the heroism of all the health-care professionals and their support staff who have worked tirelessly every day for many months, while working with courage and commitment on the front lines of this crisis.\nThe event has required us to devise urgently needed comprehensive responses, which has involved joint efforts among Governments, active political forces and multilateral organizations and international cooperation to coordinate capacities and resources to combat the disease, while safeguarding health, security and every citizen\u2019s right to food.\nThe Government of Guatemala acknowledges that no one will be safe until everyone is safe. I therefore express my country\u2019s interest in gaining immediate and fair access to vaccines and our readiness to cooperate with regard to logistics and their distribution in the countries of the region, particularly Central America.\nWe know that, by pooling efforts, we can find a solution to counter the virus and that we will be able to count on global solidarity, as we have in the past. We are grateful for the support that has been provided by the United Nations system\u2019s agencies, international actors, and friendly countries throughout the COVID-19 crisis.\nMr. President,\nFaced with the challenge of COVID-19, despite the fact that Guatemala took early preventive health-care measures, declared a \u201cState of Calamity\u201d and established a specialized commission to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease, the country has been severely affected. However, that has presented an obstacle to the country\u2019s development efforts.\nThe health-care sector, the economy and food security, among others, have been the areas most affected. We therefore implemented plans to strengthen the social and economic reconstruction of our country, while highlighting the importance of attending to the most vulnerable people.\nIn the area of health care, we encountered a system that had been neglected and forgotten for many years. Added to that was our having to deal with the current pandemic, which forced us to act from day one with aggressive plans to restore the health-care system. We have upgraded existing hospitals and opened up an additional five others in record time throughout the regions of the country. In recent months, we have increased the number of beds to more than 2,000, as well as resources and capacities to provide timely medical care to the Guatemalan population.\nI would like to acknowledge the invaluable support provided by multilateral cooperation and the friendly countries that have prioritized assisting the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare.\nWith regard to the economy, the Law of Economic Rescue to Families for the Effects Caused by COVID-19 was adopted, as a result of which the Family Bonus Fund was established, as a social financial support measure to mitigate the economic crisis within the country. Likewise, the Employment Protection Fund was also created to support companies experiencing financial difficulties so that they could continue to employ their personnel, while providing them with the option to suspend work for the duration of the crisis and a payment for three consecutive months to ensure income. In the case of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, programmes are being promoted to provide soft loans so that they can overcome liquidity problems and avoid closing down.\nWithin the framework of food security, the COVID-19 food support and prevention programme was established, which involves the delivery of basic food needs, while taking into account cultural considerations, to vulnerable families or those in areas at risk. The pandemic has aggravated one the most challenging problems already facing us \u2014 malnutrition.\nThat is why we are implementing the Grand National Crusade for Nutrition, as one of the most important programmes to be developed during my Government. The initiative aims to unite all sectors of the country in order to improve the nutrition of Guatemalan families, with an emphasis on the poorest and most marginalized areas, while applying a comprehensive approach to address the problem\u2019s myriad causes.\nWe are promoting our candidature to become a member of the Executive Board of the World Food Programme (WFP) for the period from 2021 to 2023, whence we are certain that we will be able to contribute to the promotion of food security and sustainable agriculture and the eradication of hunger and malnutrition, which represent fundamental challenges for our region.\nMoreover, in the area of respect for and the promotion of human rights, we are in the phase of restructuring the functions of the current State Ministries, with a view to addressing compliance with the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace, the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights and social conflict agreements in an effective, responsible and consistent manner in line with the Government\u2019s priorities. A detailed record was made of the international commitments assumed by the State of Guatemala in those areas in order to continue providing adequate follow-up to the reports and recommendations issued by the human rights mechanisms of both the United Nations and the inter-American systems.\nLadies and Gentlemen\nGuatemala is convinced that the work of the United Nations is crucial to sustaining peace, protecting human rights and promoting development by serving the most vulnerable. Accordingly, I will mention several important points that we must consider:\nMigrants today represent a major portion of the population and continue to suffer humiliation and unjustified discrimination because of their origin. Two years ago, Guatemala, together with other friendly States, established the International Day of Family Remittances, which is commemorated every 16 June and reminds us of migrants working far from home to support their families.\nOwing to our geography, we are a country of origin, transit, destination and return. We are deeply committed to respecting the human rights of migrants, particularly as we are currently dealing with the pandemic. We urge the international community to avoid the criminalization of migrants as their work is vital to their communities\u2019 development.\nThrough the relative United Nations agencies, we are finding opportunities to meet the challenges. That is why we advocated an agreement with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) in order to viably support dialogue on and the exchange of proposals enabling an increased focus on returning migrants.\nThe situation has provided us with lessons learned, which have enabled us to establish and improve the health-care protocols for the migrant population and responsibly shoulder our obligation to receive our fellow countrymen in a dignified manner, while preventing the pandemic to spread.\nWe continue to witness how hatred, racism, discrimination, radicalization and their dire consequences, such as terrorism, continue to claim innocent lives. As a nation with a peaceful mission, Guatemala will always advocate strengthening political dialogue to avoid any escalation of violence and seek peaceful resolutions, based on the exercise of constructive diplomacy with respects for international law.\nTo renew the purposes of the United Nations and take effective steps to prevent and eliminate threats to and breaches of peace, and suppress acts of aggression, Guatemala calls on the Security Council to act in a manner consistent with its functions, including the responsible use of the veto in order to avoid aggravating international crises. In that regard, Guatemala supports the French-Mexican initiative to limit the use of the veto in the case of mass atrocities. Therefore, it is important that efforts to reform the Council continue.\nThe reform of the United Nations remains a key issue. I emphasize this point. We need to re-engineer and enhance coordination within the entire system. We must work together for a less bureaucratic Organization. We want efforts to have a direct impact on the people most in need, while investing in development with existing human resources.\nWe know that measures to reform the Secretariat are under way, but the imperative reform of the United Nations remains an outstanding issue, and the lack of faith in multilateralism demonstrates that. As a country, Guatemala wants to show people that general debates and multilateral meetings are not vacuous speeches or pretty words. They embody the ambition to join our efforts for the sake of communities.\nWe have the human resources needed to carry out our work. We do not need United Nations cooperation to be focused on administrative issues or technical assistance. We are confident that we are working under the same banner to achieve prosperity and that, in moments of crisis, we will work to renew development, the economy and employment, all of which will translate into improved living conditions for our citizens.\nWe must promote strengthening a model that allows us to move from a paradigm of cooperation to one of investment in which countries like ours can acquire their own capacities to reduce the gaps that today challenge their development. More than ever, we are called upon to promote profound transformations. To that end, it is necessary to re-engineer the work of the Organization.\nAmong the threats facing the world, the use of nuclear weapons poses one of the greatest threats to humankind\u2019s existence. Guatemala reiterates its position in favour of complete, irreversible and transparent nuclear disarmament according to established timelines and condemns any nuclear test or threat of the use of force involving this category of weapon, which jeopardizes the continuation of life on earth. The early entry into force of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons is of great significance.\nMr. President,\nAll actions taken by global leaders will undoubtedly impact the Sustainable Development Goals. Countries must take responsibility for their own development within the framework of a common path.\nGuatemala will be a member of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) under the banner of inclusive development for all. Guatemala\u2019s election to ECOSOC represents an important commitment for my country in terms of meeting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nWithin that framework, we will expand mechanisms to address the devastating effects of climate change, which not only affects developing countries disproportionately but constitutes a crisis that must be urgently addressed.\nThe lockdown, which most of us have endured, has shown us that it was a respite for our shared home \u2014 Earth. Climate change is a reality that we cannot ignore. We must work to revitalize our ecosystems and maintain cleaner water sources, without the overbearing pressure of pollution.\nLikewise, we will seek to advocate for and promote the participation of indigenous peoples \u2014 while taking into account the fact that their millennial culture, traditions and ancestral wisdom are an essential part of sustainable development \u2014 and people with disabilities, whose talent, efforts and perseverance in the face of adversity embody strength. We will therefore be their voice so that their needs will be heard.\nMr. President,\nToday, before the Assembly, I reaffirm my country\u2019s commitment to permanently and definitively resolving, before the International Court of Justice, the territorial, insular and maritime dispute we have with Belize, with which we aspire to have a privileged relationship and a permanent dialogue to peacefully resolve our common issues.\nWe are convinced that the dispute\u2019s resolution will bring about economic, social and political benefits for both States, and, above all, development for those people residing in the adjacent zone; while, as a State, Guatemala reaffirms its democratic mission and full respect for international law.\nOn behalf of my country, today more than ever, on its seventy-fifth anniversary, I affirm my commitment to the United Nations, multilateralism, peace, respect for human rights and sustainable development for present and future generations. Let us build together more inclusive nations, while promoting prosperity and respect for our planet.\nGuatemala does not stop!\nThank you very much!"

        "file_text": "Mr President of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly; Mr Secretary-General of the United Nations;\nYour Excellencies Heads of State and Government\nExcellencies Heads of delegations;\nLadies and gentlemen!\nI am highly delighted to address, on behalf of the Mozambican people and on my own behalf, the international community in this General Debate, which takes place at a so historic and symbolic time of the celebration of the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations.\nFor the Republic of Mozambique, this celebration coincides with the 45th anniversary of the acceptance, and therefore, accession of our country, as a legitimate and fully fledged member of this Organization, which gives us our honourable place in the international community.\nI would like to recognise His Excellency Ambassador Tijjani Muhammad- Bande, President of the 74th Session of the General Assembly, for his performance and I congratulate You Mr Volkan Bozkir, President of this Session of the General Assembly and I express my country\u2019s willingness to work together for the success of your tenure.\nI warmly congratulate Mr Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, for his tireless commitment to upholding the ideals enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations; by placing the United Nations in the lead of collective efforts to overcome contemporary challenges, including its initiatives, aimed at addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMr President,\nExcellencies!\nToday\u2019s world is markedly different from the one that existed when the UN was founded. There have been significant improvements in our collective wellbeing. Social and human development indicators have improved substantially. Life expectancy increased, mortality and morbidity reduced, the number of Member States almost quadrupled from 51 to 193 countries, including Mozambique. Efforts to empower women are now a deepening reality.\nThe theme of this General Assembly faithfully reflects the essence of the United Nations and is a call for renewal of the vision for an integrated and cooperative world, where nations express themselves in an open manner and act in a coordinated way in promoting sustainable and inclusive development, taking the 2030 Agenda as their banner.\nMozambique, therefore, upholds the assumptions of \u201ccommon but differentiated responsibility\u201d, as well as internationally agreed development goals, in the light of the Paris Declaration on the Effectiveness of Development Aid\u201d.\nAll this shows that multilateral cooperation remains the best approach to addressing the challenges and mitigating the suffering of the people who are the main reason for the creation of the United Nations.\nMultilateralism within the United Nations is also key if we take into account that the world economy, especially that of developing countries, has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and its restoration requires global, integrated and concerted interventions.\nNationalism and isolationism in the face of a pandemic are, as far as we are concerned, a prescription for failure to respond to this and other infectious diseases of an unpredictable nature.\nOther global phenomena and challenges calling for the United Nations\u2019 led multilateral intervention, include terrorism, climate change, cybersecurity, public health, research and development, trade and industrialization.\nIn the global village in which we live, national and international issues are increasingly less discernible. The transnational nature and interconnection of these phenomena require leadership that recognises that, in today\u2019s world, our interventions must take into account the intrinsic relationship between the national, regional and global citizens.\nMr President,\nExcellencies!\nMozambique welcomes and reiterates its support for the Actions of the Secretary General, aimed at reforming the United Nations, in the areas of peace and security, peace operations, development and management of the organization.\nNevertheless, we are concerned about the lack of progress in the inter-governmental negotiations so that the reform of the Security Council will yield results in line with the 21st century.\nThe reform has the merit of placing international peace, security and stability as catalysts for the global development agenda, as well as making the UN more representative, efficient and transparent, based on the contemporary geopolitical situation, which will render the decisions of this body more effective and legitimate.\nSo once again we call on the international community to take advantage of this historic moment of our universal organization\u2019s 75th anniversary to combine efforts to a sustainable solution to outstanding security issues.\nMr President,\nExcellencies!\nThe Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals are instruments that fuel the hope of billions of people around the world in achieving the long-awaited progress and well-being of all peoples. In this context, Mozambique submitted in July 2020 its first Voluntary National Report on the Sustainable Development Goals, which shares achievements based on the aspirations of the Mozambican people, in compliance with this international instrument reflected in our Five-Year Government Programme 2020-2024.\n\u201cThe Future we want\u201d lies in the actions of the present; the \u201cUnited Nations we need\u201d depend on our posture and responsible action, today and tomorrow. Only with a collective approach and humanism, we will successfully implement the agenda of inclusiveness that we have chosen of \u201cleaving no one behind\u201d.\nIt is in this context that the Government of Mozambique promotes peacebuilding, the preservation of human rights, social justice, gender equality and equity, the inclusion of young people and people with disabilities in development programmes, cementing the unity and sharing of benefits, which is salient feature of our governance.\nWith regard to climate change, due to its geographical location, Mozambique has been cyclically affected by extreme events. Every year, the country has suffered cyclones, floods and droughts and memories of Cyclones Idai and Kenneth in March and April 2019 are still fresh.\nMore than a year later, we continue efforts to rebuild and recover socioeconomic damage, combined with adaptation and resilience measures, in the light of internationally accepted practices under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change to which we have been a party since June 2018.\nWe take this opportunity to reiterate our gratitude to the international community for the support provided during and after the cyclones.\nMozambique continues to promote sustainable management of biodiversity and ecosystems and natural resources, with the purpose of adding value to the integrated local development of communities. In this regard, the promotion of conservation areas, in national territory, continues to deserve our special attention.\nOn the other hand, we have sought to expand access to electricity for domestic and industrial consumption, through clean and renewable sources, whether it is thermoelectric power, natural gas powered plants, wind and solar power, in addition to hydropower, in order to ensure the achievement of the universal access target by 2030. At present, all 154 district headquarters are connected to the national power grid, and the electrification programme for administrative posts is underway.\nRecognising the role of agriculture to this end, the Government decided to allocate 10 per cent of its annual budget to this sector for the first time, in line with the Maputo Declaration on Agriculture and Food Security adopted by the African Union in 2003.\nIt in this regard that we launched the Integrated Management Programme for Agriculture and Natural Resources \u2014 SUSTENTA, which promotes the socio-economic integration of the Mozambican population.\nMr President,\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, officially announced by the WHO in December 2019, took the world by surprise. It is a health scourge with a high degree of spread and lethality, with greater severity in developing countries, particularly in Africa.\nCOVID-19 has transformed the dynamics of trade, professional and social relations among human beings in all spheres of life, both in urban and rural environments.\nThis scenario requires the mobilisation of additional financial resources to compensate for the economic slowdown, given that the scourge of the pandemic still prevails around the world and in our country, in particular.\nWhile response measures to COVID-19 continue, we take this opportunity to thank the bilateral and multilateral partners of the international community for the multiple support that has enabled us to prevent and contain the spread of the new coronavirus and embark on what we call the \u201cnew normal\u201d.\nExcellencies!\nThe massive efforts we have been making in the framework of peace and security consolidation, as well as in the implementation of the socio-economic development programme, aligned with the 2030 Agenda, have been put to the test by terrorist acts and criminals in some districts of Cabo Delgado province, and by armed actions by allegedly dissident RENAMO groups in some parts of Manica and Sofala provinces, in the central region of the country. Terrorists heinously kill people, cause displaced people, destroy housing and socio-economic infrastructure, plunder community property and keep children and women in captivity. As a consequence of these phenomena, more than 1,000 people have been killed, and some 250,000 people are internally displaced in other districts within the country.\nIn the face of terrorist attacks, the Government has responded firmly, on the one hand, with the support of local people, through actions to defend sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as to the protection of people and their property. On the other hand, the Government has mobilized humanitarian assistance for the internally displaced people and promotes socio-economic development activities for the communities.\nIt was under these efforts that we recently launched and operationalised the Northern Region Integrated Development Agency (ADIN) with the aim of promoting multi-sectoral actions with a view to the integrated socio-economic development of the provinces of Niassa, Cabo Delgado and Nampula.\nAware that the terrorist actions of which the country is a victim have links with international groups that are also involved in transnational organized crime, we have sought to address this phenomenon in cooperation with other countries and regional and international organizations.\nIn this context, we welcome all initiatives and partnerships that will go a long way in complementing our ongoing efforts to curtail the harmful actions of terrorists in our country.\nAs part of the implementation of the Peace and Reconciliation Agreement between the Government and RENAMO, we are implementing decentralization and the Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) process of RENAMO\u2019s remnant armed elements that has already covered about 1,000 ex-combatants.\nWe would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude for the role of the United Nations and the international community, particularly the dynamism of the Secretary-General\u2019s Personal Envoy.\nMr President,\nLadies and gentlemen!\nAs we conclude our remarks, we reaffirm our firm belief that international security and peace making and maintenance, the preservation and respect for human rights and the promotion of sustainable development, only find fertile ground to flourished, in the common approach and collective action of all stakeholders in the world. We have said so with great humility and willingness to serve our people and to contribute to the prosperity of humanity.\nWe want, with actions to contribute to the \u201cFuture we want\u201d, to shape the \u201cUnited Nations we need\u201d, and \u201ctherefore, renew our commitment to multilateralism\u201d, and valuing the most precious commodity of the universe, LIFE, and Quality LIFE.\nLet us therefore revisit our global commitment to the consolidation of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, keeping in mind the main recipients of these efforts, namely \u201cWe The Peoples\u201d!\nHappy Celebration to the United Nations!\nThank you very much!"

        "file_text": "In the name of God, the most merciful,\nYour Majesties and Excellencies Heads of State and Government,\nMr. President,\nMr. Secretary-General,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nMay the peace, mercy and blessings of God Almighty be upon you.\nIt is my pleasure to address you today, over a year since the glorious December revolution, for which the young women and men of the Sudan paid the price with their precious blood. The revolution represented a sincere expression of the people and their aspirations to freedom, peace and justice.\nIt is our great hope that the work of this session will be successful. I am also pleased to extend my sincere congratulations to you, Mr. Volkan Bozkir, on your election as President of the General Assembly, and wish you success. I must also express my appreciation for the great efforts made by your predecessor, Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, the outgoing President of the General Assembly, for his tireless efforts during the seventy-fourth session.\nThe deliberations of the current session are taking place at a most critical time. The world is facing a strange, mysterious enemy that spreads rapidly and ferociously, leaving devastation in its wake, surpassing all geographical boundaries without distinction between rich and poor countries. It has left the world with no choice but to choose solidarity as a means of response.\nTherefore, from this rostrum we call for enhanced cooperation and strengthened collective action mechanisms so that, together, we may face the challenges posed by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. We must strive to achieve this session\u2019s theme: \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism \u2014 confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action\u201d.\nIn that connection, we would like to state our support and appreciation for the World Health Organization and commend the role it has played in combating the pandemic from the outset. We also commend the technical support it has provided to affected countries. We also wish to thank all the countries and organizations that supported us in this area.\nThe Sudan is currently experiencing exceptional circumstances due to the impact of unprecedented torrential rain and floods, which have exacerbated the challenges we already face. The flooding of the Nile has led to severe loss of human life and property throughout the areas adjacent to it. Great damage has also been caused by the rain and floods in other vast areas, including the partial or total collapse of tens of thousands of homes. I would like, in that regard, to pay tribute to all our friendly and brotherly countries that have demonstrated their solidarity by providing generous support in response to that catastrophe.\nAs the Assembly is aware, the Sudan is undergoing a transitional phase following a glorious popular revolution against injustice, tyranny and socioeconomic decline. The transitional Government is addressing the broad aspirations of the Sudanese people and trying its utmost to tackle the new challenges most important of which is establishing peace and economic reform.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has further complicated the situation for the transitional Government, which inherited a crippled economy and weak and devastated service sectors, particularly the health sector, which has been neglected for decades.\nIt is important to preserve the values of multilateralism and international cooperation that underpin the Charter of the United Nations and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. That is essential in order to reinforce the three pillars of the United Nations: security, development and human rights.\nMoreover, global issues such as climate change, geopolitical tensions and humanitarian crises in their various forms mean that we must reach understandings that respect the values and interests of people. This calls for our shared interest and action through multilateralism and diplomacy, especially at a time when the political, social and economic landscapes and relations among countries are being impacted by technological progress and information acceleration.\nThe adoption of the Constitutional Declaration on 17 August 2019 constituted the second stage of the victory of the revolution, making peace and putting an end to the war the top priority of the transitional Government. That was the basis upon which the Juba process was launched. It was not simply a negotiation between two warring parties, as it had been in the past, but rather a process of dialogue between the partners of a revolution in order to achieve peace and the cessation of war, as well as to address all the root causes of the conflict. The Juba peace agreement will be signed on 3 October.\nRegarding the humanitarian situation, we express our thanks and appreciation to the United Nations and its humanitarian agencies, all international organizations and the donor community for their support to the revolution Government in its efforts to address the issues of displaced persons, refugees and repatriated citizens by providing food and health care.\nIn that context, we wish to note that the revolution Government hastened to remove all restrictions and obstacles that were hindering the delivery of humanitarian aid to those in need in conflict areas. Within that framework, as part of its national plan to improve humanitarian action and ensure that the needs of its population are met, the State is adopting projects to find sustainable solutions to improve the living conditions of displaced persons, in accordance with the provisions of international instruments and laws governing humanitarian work\nOur country is now working closely with UNAMID on its exit strategy on 31 December in line with Security Council resolution 2525 (2020). The latest step taken on the transfer of tasks was the implementation of phase one of the national plan for the protection of civilians, which has been circulated as an official Security Council document since 21 May. We also submitted our first progress report on its implementation until 15 August. We will continue to implement our national plan in order to fully assume all tasks relating to the protection of civilians before 31 December, after which the Sudan will be hosting the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in the Sudan (UNITAMS).\nOn the economic front, the economic situation continues increasingly to weigh on the citizens and is a result of economic distortions caused by the defunct regime. Furthermore, the profound reforms that we set out to implement, which are aimed at remedying the structural defect in the Sudanese economy, have indirectly increased the cost of living. These reforms are painful and arduous, but they are necessary in the long term. In order to mitigate their effects, we have started implementing a social programme to support families and provide direct financial aid to the poorest families with the aim of mitigating the effects of these reforms. This programme is also aimed at supporting production by providing direct support to agricultural and labour groups that are productive in rural and urban areas. The Government also supports establishing cooperative projects and implementing a commodity programme, which are projects aimed at providing basic commodities to citizens.\nMy country\u2019s Government attaches great importance to the issue of the rule of law at the national and international levels and is making continuous efforts to address national laws with a view to developing them and ensuring their consistency with international standards and conventions. These efforts are also consistent with multiple initiatives undertaken locally by relevant authorities in the areas of building and strengthening national capacities and empowering the competent bodies to fulfil their responsibilities and tasks in accordance with the constitution and related laws. The process of achieving the rule of law at the national level is the responsibility of States and Governments.\nThe Constitutional Declaration has given special attention to human rights issues, as a whole chapter has been devoted to freedoms and rights. In implementing the Declaration, the transitional Government has taken a number of positive steps to address the distortions that were attached to this issue throughout the period of the previous totalitarian rule. First among these steps is the repeal of a number of laws that restrict freedoms; promote the role of women in society; protect their rights; allow freedom of opinion, expression and peaceful assembly; and combat impunity. The transitional Government has also been eager to strengthen cooperation with the international community. In this context, an agreement was signed to open the regional office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in September 2019. The office has been operational in the Sudan since January.\nRegarding efforts to reintegrate the Sudan into the international system, we take this opportunity to express our high appreciation for the initiative of Germany, with the participation of a number of countries, to establish the Group of Friends of the Sudan. Success in the formation of the Group and the regularity of its meetings represent momentum towards the reintegration of the Sudan into the international system after isolation that lasted 30 years. This was exemplified by the success of the Sudan Partnership Conference in Berlin on 25 June, with the participation of more than 50 countries and regional and international organizations.\nThe Sudan continues to actively contribute to supporting the stability of the political and security situations in the countries of the African continent, especially the countries of the region, through its active membership in regional organizations such as the African Union, IGAD, the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, the Sahel and the Sahara. On this occasion, I would like to express our appreciation to the great positive role that the African Union has played in confronting the coronavirus pandemic in Africa.\nI also stress that the Sudan, during its presidency of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, has strived to achieve goals consistent with the strategic goals of IGAD. The decision of the sixteenth IGAD Ordinary Summit in November 2019 to agree on the Sudan\u2019s presidency of the organization was an affirmation of Sudan\u2019s strong return to the region. The Sudan has laid down a vision for its presidency related to peace, security, regional integration, empowering women and youth and revitalizing the organization. IGAD held a number of summits, including one to support the peace process in the sisterly Republic of South Sudan and another to address the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe Sudan expresses its solidarity with the victims of terrorism around the world and with all countries that have suffered from terrorist attacks. We have renewed our rejection and condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations through our cooperation, accession and effective contribution to the international and bilateral efforts against terrorism and its financing. We are committed to implementing the relevant international resolutions issued by the Security Council.\nThe Sudan, despite the change caused by the blood of its martyrs after decades of oppression, injustice and backwardness, and despite the achievements made during the brief span of its glorious revolution, the transitional period still faces a number of daunting challenges that must be overcome with the continued support of the international community and friends in order to complete the implementation of the Government\u2019s plans. The aim is to address the economic hardship that the country is going through, foremost among which by the waiving of the Sudan\u2019s debts and the granting of soft loans, as well as the commitment of friends to fulfilling their pledges announced during the Sudan Partnership Conference in Berlin. Before all that, the name of the Sudan must be removed from the list of countries sponsoring terrorism, so that our country can return fully to the international community after a forced interruption of three decades. In that context, I wish to commend the recent steps taken by the US administration and the US Congress to support the transitional Government, including the determination to accelerate steps to drop the Sudan from the list of terrorist countries.\nIn conclusion, I want to confirm our determination to complete our construction projects, reform our internal institutions and strengthen our external relations so that the Sudan can become an active member in its region. We want to participate with the international community in creating the future we want and in occupying our rightful place in order to contribute to strengthening the role of the United Nations. A few days ago, we celebrated its seventy-fifth anniversary. We want it to be the Organization we need with a view to achieving cooperation, pluralism and collective work as a successful approach to meeting the challenges that threaten the peoples of the world."

        "file_text": "In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate\nYour Excellency, President of the General Assembly,\nYour Excellency, Secretary-General of the United Nations,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nAssalamu\u2019alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh.\nAt the outset, I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Volkan Bozkir on assuming the presidency of the Seventy-Fifth Session of the General Assembly, wishing him every success and favorable outcome. I also thank His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, President of the previous session, for the appreciated efforts he exerted during his tenure, and I avail myself of this opportunity to commend the role of His Excellency the Secretary-General. Mr. Antonio Guterres in promoting the role of the United Nations and achieving its goals.\nMr. President,\nThe convening of this session comes as we celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, and it is opportune on this occasion to remember that it is an institutional expression of our awareness that we belong to one humanity. There are many historical experiences that substantiate this fact and prove the risk of underestimating it.\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has reminded us that we live on the same planet, and that multilateral cooperation is the only way to address the challenges of epidemics, climate and the environment in general, and it\u2019s also preferable to remember this when dealing with the issues of poverty, war and peace, and realizing our common goals for security and stability.\nBased on this understanding, and after the State of Qatar hastened to take all preventative actions and measures to protect the citizens and the residents on its territory, it has not seen any contradiction between its duty in this respect and providing aid to more than 60 countries and five international organizations, and participating actively in the international efforts to mobilize resources and potentials to address this epidemic and its repercussions, as well as supporting research centers in several countries to limit the serious negative ramifications of this pandemic and to expedite the development of a vaccine for this virus.\nMr. President,\nAfter more than three years since the start of the unjust and illegal blockade on the State of Qatar, we have continued the march of progress and development in various fields.\nDespite the blockade, Qatar has strengthened its effective participation in the multilateral international action to find solutions to other crises.\nAnd during the unjust and unlawful blockade it is going through it also has securely established its policy founded on respecting the rules and principles of international law and the United Nations Charter, especially, the principle of respecting the sovereignty of states and rejecting intervention in their internal affairs.\nAnd based on our moral and legal responsibilities towards our peoples, we have affirmed, and we will continue to reaffirm, that unconditional dialogue based on common interests and respect for the sovereignty of states is the way to solve this crisis which had started with an illegal blockade, and whose solution starts with lifting this blockade.\nOn this occasion, I reiterate my deep appreciation for the sincere efforts of His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Amir of the sisterly State of Kuwait, and to commend highly the endeavors of brotherly and friendly countries to bring this crisis to an end.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nThere is an international consensus on the fairness of the Palestinian cause, but despite this consensus, the international community stands helpless without taking any effective steps vis-a-vis the Israeli intransigence and persistence in occupying the Palestinian and Arab lands, besides imposing a stifling siege on the Gaza Strip, continuing a policy of expanding settlements, imposing a fait accompli policy in a flagrant violation of international legitimacy resolutions and the two-state solution agreed upon by the international community.\nA just and desired peace can only be achieved through Israel\u2019s full commitment to the terms of reference and decisions of the international legitimacy accepted by the Arabs and upon which the Arab Peace Initiative is based, while Israel tries to circumvent it and acts as if the Palestinian cause does not exist. Any arrangements that are not based on these terms of reference will not achieve peace, even if they are called peace. It may have intents other than the just solution to the Palestinian cause, and other than achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace.\nThe lingering of the Palestinian cause without a just solution, and Israel\u2019s continued settlements and creation of pretexts on the ground without being deterred pose the biggest question mark on the credibility of the international community and its institutions.\nWe call on the international community \u2014especially the Security Council \u2014 to assume its legal responsibilities to obligate Israel to lift the siege on the Gaza Strip, put the peace process back on track through credible negotiations based on the international resolutions and not on force, to address all final status issues, ending the occupation within a specified time frame and establishing an independent Palestinian state within the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, and to end the Israeli occupation of all Arab territories.\nAnd in the context of our endeavor to prepare the appropriate conditions to reach peace and to respond to the economic and humanitarian difficulties facing our brothers in Palestine, we, in coordination with our international partners, have continued providing humanitarian and developmental aid to cater for urgent and longterm needs in the besieged Gaza Strip, in addition to increasing our contributions to UNRWA.\nMr. President\nBased on our firm belief in resolving disputes by peaceful means, and with the grace of God and thanks to Him, the State of Qatar\u2019s mediation efforts have culminated in signing a peace agreement between the United States and the Taliban movement, in Doha, on 29 February, 2020, and was able to make an exchange of prisoners between the government of Afghanistan and the Taliban movement a success during the discussions held in Doha last month.\nOur efforts, along with our international partners, to convene the Intra-Afghan peace negotiations which began on the 12th of this month, in Doha, have culminated in success, and its ensuing success now depends on the Afghan brothers themselves. We will exert our efforts in cooperation with the international community to facilitate the dialogue, in the hope that peace and stability will soon prevail across Afghanistan, if everyone decides to completely renounce violence, and accept diversity, difference and equal citizenship in this country.\nMr. President,\nAfter more than nine years since the Syrian crisis which witnessed unprecedented humanitarian tragedies, whose serious negative impacts are year after year, it is still impossible to reach an end to this crisis due to the intransigence of the Syrian regime and the inaction of the international community, especially, the Security Council, in assuming its duty to maintain international peace and security and protect civilians.\nThe Syrian regime still obstructs even the process of drafting a new constitution, proposed by Russia, which, unfortunately, is all that was left of the international efforts to realize some sort of a peaceful solution. The regime deals with this effort with the same strategy of keeping up pace with the international community that it followed by ostensibly participating in negotiations to gain time without intending to make any change.\nOn this occasion, I reiterate the firm stance of the State of Qatar that the only way to end the Syrian crisis is a political solution based on the Geneva Communique (1), and the implementation of Security Council Resolution 2254 (2015). The State of Qatar also affirms that it will continue, with the international community, to support efforts to realize justice and holding accountable the perpetrators of atrocities, war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria.\nIn the humanitarian field, we will continue to provide all forms of support and assistance to the brotherly Syrian people in areas of displacement and refuge till the end of this crisis.\nAs for the raging war in sisterly Yemen which is still demolishing the urban buildings in Yemen, wiping out the necessities of life, and threatening security in the region, we affirm that the only way to resolve this crisis is through negotiation between the Yemenis in accordance with the outcomes of the National Dialogue, the Gulf initiative, and the relevant Security Council resolutions, particularly, resolution 2216 (2015). We affirm our firm position on the unity of Yemen and its territorial integrity.\nAs for the brotherly Sudan, we value the signing of a peace agreement in Juba, between the Transitional Government in Sudan and a host of armed movements, and we express our appreciation to the state of South Sudan for sponsoring the signing of this agreement, and we look forward to the rest of the factions to join the peace process. We stress the firm stance of the State of Qatar beside the brotherly Sudanese people to successfully pass through this transitional period and achieve their aspirations for stability and development.\nWe reiterate the call on the relevant countries to facilitate the efforts of the brothers in Sudan to remove the name of Sudan from the list of states sponsoring terrorism, as the difficulties and hardships they are facing have taken their toll on them. In this context, Qatar stood with the brothers by providing them with support to counter the flooding that severely inflicted serious damage to facilities and the people as well, and we call upon the international community to provide them with all kinds of necessary support to counter the natural disasters.\nRegarding the Libyan issue, we reiterate welcoming the ceasefire agreement and activating the political process in accordance with the Skhirat Agreement and all its outcomes, to achieve a comprehensive political settlement that will maintain Libyan sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence, and stem the bloodshed of its people and preserve its wealth. It is beneficial for all to understand the impossibility of imposing a military regime by force in Libya.\nWe were pained by what Lebanon went through in the aftermath of the explosion at the port of Beirut. We stood beside our Lebanese brothers without conditions. It is not our habit to impose political conditions to show solidarity during disasters. But in the end, it will be incumbent on the Lebanese themselves, and not by a dictation, to find agreed upon ways for reform to fulfill the aspirations of an entire generation for a state based on citizenship rather than any other affiliations. This, incidentally, is an aspiration shared by the younger generation across the entire region.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nTerrorism remains one of the most prominent challenges facing the world as it poses a real threat to international peace and security, and impedes achieving sustainable development for peoples. We in the State of Qatar spare no effort to actively participate in international and regional efforts to address this phenomenon and tackle its roots, especially by supporting education for millions of children, youth and women and creating job opportunities for young men.\nIn this context, Qatar is strengthening the strategic partnership with the relevant United Nations agencies. I am referring here to the opening of a program office of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Office in Doha next May to implement behavioral insights on combating terrorism and violent extremism.\nMr. President,\nIn the field of development assistance to developing countries and the least developed countries, and to support countries affected by the negative impacts of climate change, Qatar has fulfilled its pledge by providing a contribution of $100 million to support the Least developed countries and Small Island Developing States to deal with climate change.\nWe are pleased to host in Doha from 23 to 27 January 2022 the Fifth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries. We are confident that this conference will support their march towards achieving their development for the next decade in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nIn conclusion, we affirm the State of Qatar\u2019s commitment to the declaration adopted by the General Assembly on September 21st with the participation of Heads of State and Government, and in which the State of Qatar assumed \u2014 in partnership with the Kingdom of Sweden \u2014 a role in facilitating the international negotiations for its adoption. We will continue to work with the United Nations to achieve its goals and address the common challenges to maintain the interest of our peoples and the good for humanity.\nThank you, and may God\u2019s peace, mercy and blessings be upon you."

        "file_text": "President of the General Assembly, Secretary-General, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, seventy-five years ago, the United Nations was established to introduce a new world order to achieve peace in the world. It was the dawn of a new era of global cooperation, forged in the aftermath of one of the darkest periods in the history of humankind.\nIn 1945, the world was in crisis. It was counting the devastation wrought by war, devastation and plunder. Today, we are in the throes of another crisis \u2014 the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. If we are to build a common and inclusive future in the aftermath of COVID-19, it is this solidarity that must endure. In the words of Nelson Mandela: \u201cIt is human solidarity, the concern for the other, that must be at the centre of the values by which we all live.\u201d\nAs the African continent, our response to coronavirus has been swift and effective. We have a continental strategy to fight the pandemic being driven by the regional economic communities. The African Union has established a COVID-19 Response Fund and launched a ground-breaking African Medical Supplies Platform to ensure all countries have access to the necessary equipment and supplies.\nNonetheless, the pandemic will inevitably set back our developmental aspirations. The resources we have had to redirect to fighting the pandemic have set back our efforts to provide housing, health care, water and sanitation and education to our people.\nWhen the Secretary-General Antonio Guterres delivered the 18th Nelson Mandela Annual Lecture in July 2020, he called on the nations of the world to forge a New Social Contract and a New Global Deal.\nHe said we must create equal opportunities for all, that we must advance a more inclusive and balanced multilateral trading system, that debt architecture must be reformed, and that there should be greater access to affordable credit for developing countries.\nIt is a call we as South Africa wholly endorse.\nIt is in the spirit of this New Global Deal, that we call on the international community and our international partners to support the rollout of a comprehensive stimulus package for Africa.\nThis will enable African countries to not only mitigate the health impacts of COVID-19 but to aid us in the immense task of rebuilding our shattered economies.\nTo ensure that no country is left behind we reiterate our position as the African Union that economic sanctions against Zimbabwe and Sudan be lifted to allow their governments to respond adequately to the pandemic. We also call for the suspension of interest payments on Africa\u2019s external and public debt.\nAs the African Union we are encouraged by the collaboration of the G20, the IMF, the World Bank and the UN towards finding solutions to debt sustainability in developing countries.\nThis pandemic has highlighted the urgency with which we must strive to meet all the Sustainable Development Goals, but importantly Goal 1 \u2014 to end poverty in all its forms everywhere.\nFor until we eradicate global poverty, we will always fall short of realising the vision of the founders of the United Nations .\nWe must expand economic opportunities to all our people, but most especially to the young, to women and to vulnerable persons.\nWe must boldly pursue avenues of redistribution and redress as a means of advancing shared prosperity.\nWe must deal decisively with the rot of corruption that is robbing our people of the opportunities and services that are their right.\nTogether, we must raise our level of ambition to ensure that every man, woman and child has an equal chance at a better future.\nIt is a future free of hunger, disease, insecurity and war.\nIt is a world that affirms the dignity and worth of all, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religious affiliation or social circumstances.\nThe year 2020 will be remembered for the massive groundswell to push back the frontiers of racism under the umbrella of the #BlackLivesMatter movement.\nAs a country that has known too well the anguish of institutionalised racism, South Africa supports the demands for swift action against racism, whether committed by individuals, companies, officials or the state.\nSouth Africa calls on the United Nations to spare no effort to end prejudice and intolerance in all its forms and wherever it may be found.\nIn the words of Dr Martin Luther King Jr:\n\u201cInjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\u201d\nAs we mark the 25th Anniversary of the adoption of the Beijing Platform for Action, we must intensify our efforts to empower women and girls. It is the right of women and girls to be full and equal participants in the workplace, in political life and decision-making, in the economy, in obtaining an education and in society as a whole.\nSouth Africa is proud to be a member of the UN\u2019s Generation Equality campaign and has prioritised the eradication of gender based violence and femicide.\nAt a continental level, we are working to finalise and adopt an AU Convention on Violence against Women during the course of this year.\nAU member states are engaging on measures to promote financial inclusion, preferential procurement and preferential trade agreements for women.\nAs African countries we continue with our effort to \u2018silence the guns\u2019 once and for all through conflict resolution and peace-building.\nCooperation between the UN Security Council and the AU Peace and Security Council has contributed to improved peace and security in the Darfur region of Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia, Mali and the Central African Republic.\nIt is imperative that this collaboration is institutionalised and that the financing of AU peacekeeping operations is addressed and resolved.\nSouth Africa is currently serving its second year as an elected non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.\nWe have used our tenure to promote international peace and security by advocating for the peaceful settlement of disputes and inclusive dialogue.\nThe current composition of the Security Council does not reflect the world in which we live.\nOn this 75th anniversary of the UN we repeat our call for greater representation of African countries on the Security Council,and that this be taken up with urgency at the Intergovernmental Negotiations.\nIt is only through a reformed and inclusive Security Council that we will be able to collectively resolve some of the world\u2019s most protracted conflicts.\nAs we celebrate the founding of an organisation dedicated to freedom and equality, the people of Palestine and Western Sahara continue to live under occupation.\nWe repeat our call for an end to the illegal occupation of Western Sahara and for the Palestinian people\u2019s right to self-determination.\nWe further call for the lifting of the economic embargo and blockade of Cuba.\nYour Excellencies,\nWe have no choice but to work together to address the climate change crisis.\nAs we rebuild in the aftermath of this pandemic we have an opportunity to place the global economy on a low-carbon, climate resilient developmental path.\nWe must advance the principles of the green and circular economies, not just for the sake of environmental sustainability but because of the opportunities for job creation and economic growth.\nThe global recovery effort must place climate change adaptation, mitigation and support at its centre \u2014 in line with the Paris Agreement and other multilateral environmental commitments.\nAs the founders of the UN stood at a crossroads in 1945, so do we 75 years later.\nThey answered history\u2019s call to craft a new order for a world in crisis.\nToday we battle the fires of a deadly pandemic, of racism and prejudice, of violence, war and extremism and, above all, of poverty and inequality.\nThe order we seek to build must be rooted in solidarity, equality and unity of purpose.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has presented us with a choice.\nIt is a choice between the global cooperation envisaged in the UN Charter or the pursuit of narrow self-interest and unilateralism.\nIt is a choice between tolerance or prejudice.\nIt is a choice between economic justice or growing inequality.\nThe path we choose now will determine our collective destiny.\nThough we face the most daunting of prospects, we have at our disposal the most potent force.\nIt is the solidarity and friendship upon which the United Nations was founded.\nWhen history faithfully records the global response to the worst health emergency of this century, let it be said that we stood and acted as one, that we provided leadership, and that we gave the peoples of all nations hope and courage.\nThe best, and most fitting, legacy of this 75th Session will be that through our actions we gave true meaning to the term \u2018United Nations\u2019.\nSouth Africa reaffirms its commitment to the ideals and spirit of the UN Charter, and to sparing no effort to bring about a more just, peaceful and equitable world.\nMay our cooperation deepen and may our solidarity endure.\nLet us make sure that all our efforts leave no woman, no child and no man behind, and that no nation is left behind.\n"

        "file_text": "It is my profound honor to address the United Nations General Assembly.\n75 years after the end of World War Two and the founding of the United Nations, we are once again engaged in a great global struggle.\nWe have waged a fierce battle against the invisible enemy \u2014 the China Virus \u2014 which has claimed countless lives in 188 countries.\nIn the United States, we launched the most aggressive mobilization since the Second World War.\nWe rapidly produced a record supply of ventilators \u2014 creating a surplus that allowed us to share them with friends and partners all around the globe.\nWe pioneered life-saving treatments, reducing our fatality rate 85 per cent since April.\nThanks to our efforts, 3 vaccines are in the final stage of clinical trials.\nWe are mass producing them in advance so they can be delivered immediately upon arrival.\nWe will distribute a vaccine, we will defeat the virus, we will end the pandemic, and we will enter a new era of unprecedented prosperity, cooperation and peace.\nAs we pursue this bright future, we must hold accountable the nation which unleashed this plague onto the world: China.\nIn the earliest days of the virus, China locked down travel domestically while allowing flights to leave China and infect the world.\nChina condemned my travel ban on their country, even as they cancelled domestic flights and locked citizens in their homes.\nThe Chinese government, and the World Health Organization -- which is virtually controlled by China \u2014 falsely declared that there was no evidence of human- to-human transmission.\nLater, they falsely said people without symptoms would not spread the disease.\nThe United Nations must hold China accountable for their actions.\nIn addition, every year China dumps millions and millions of tons of plastic and trash into the oceans, overfishes other countries\u2019 waters, destroys vast swaths of coral reef, and emits more toxic mercury into the atmosphere than any country anywhere in the world.\nChina\u2019s carbon emissions are nearly twice what the U.S. has, and it\u2019s rising fast.\nBy contrast, after I withdrew from the one-sided Paris Climate Accord, last year America reduced its carbon emissions by more than any country in the agreement.\nThose who attack America\u2019s exceptional environmental record while ignoring China\u2019s rampant pollution are not interested in the environment.\nThey only want to punish America and I will not stand for it.\nIf the United Nations is to be an effective organization, it must focus on the real problems of the world.\nThis includes terrorism, the oppression of women, forced labor, drug trafficking, human and sex trafficking, religious persecution, and the ethnic cleansing of religious minorities.\nAmerica will always be a leader in human rights.\nMy administration is advancing religious liberty, opportunity for women, the decriminalization of homosexuality, combatting human trafficking, and protecting unborn children.\nWe also know that American prosperity is the bedrock of freedom and security all over the world.\nIn three short years, we built the greatest economy in history \u2014 and we are quickly doing it again.\nOur military has increased substantially in size. We spent $2.5 trillion over the last 4 years on our military. We have the most powerful military anywhere in the world, and it\u2019s not even close.\nWe stood up to decades of China\u2019s trade abuses.\nWe revitalized the NATO Alliance where other countries are now paying a much more fair share.\nWe forged historic partnerships with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to stop human smuggling.\nWe are standing with the people of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela in their righteous struggle for freedom.\nWe withdrew from the terrible Iran Nuclear Deal and imposed crippling sanctions on the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terror. jsEpj We obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100 per cent, killed its founder and leader, Al-Baghdadi, and eliminated the world\u2019s top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani.\nThis month we achieved a peace deal between Serbia and Kosovo.\nWe reached a landmark breakthrough with two Peace Deals in the Middle East \u2014 after decades of no progress.\nIsrael, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain all signed a historic peace agreement at the White House, with many other Middle Eastern countries to come. They are coming fast and they know it\u2019s great for them, and it\u2019s great for the world.\nThese groundbreaking peace deals are the dawn of the new Middle East.\nBy taking a different approach, we have achieved different outcomes. Far superior outcomes. We took an approach and the approach worked.\nWe intend to deliver more peace agreements shortly, and I have never been more optimistic for the future of the region. There is no blood in the sand. Those days are hopefully over.\nAs we speak, the United States is also working to end the war in Afghanistan \u2014 and we are bringing our troops home.\nAmerica is fulfilling our destiny as peacemaker. But it is peace through strength. We are stronger now than ever before, our weapons are at an advanced level like we\u2019ve never had before, like frankly we\u2019ve never even thought of having before, and I only pray to God that we never have to use them.\nFor decades, the same tired voices proposed the same failed solutions, pursuing global ambitions at the expense of their own people.\nBut only when you take care of your own citizens, will you find a true basis for cooperation.\nAs President, I have rejected the failed approaches of the past \u2014 and I am proudly putting America First, just as you should be putting your countries first. That\u2019s okay, that\u2019s what you should be doing.\nI am supremely confident that next year, when we gather in person, we will be in the midst of one of the greatest years in our history and frankly, hopefully, in the history of the world.\nThank you, God Bless you all. God Bless America. And God Bless the United Nations.\n"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, fellow delegates, my friends.\nThank you for the opportunity to address this Assembly. Like many of you, I have spoken in this forum before, but never like this, at a time like this.\nThe world is in crisis.\nAnd not just because of the last few months. Not just because of COVID-19.\nBut because of the last few decades. And because of us.\nThis is our wake-up call, and we cannot ignore it.\nTime and time again, history has shown us that the price to pay for turning away, for failing to act, is much too high.\nOur parents and grandparents remember all too well what things were like in the 30s and the 40s.\nEconomies collapsed. Governments \u2014 and systems of government \u2014 crumbled. Millions died.\nThat was the world they faced. That was the challenge they had to meet. And this is what they did about it.\nOur parents and grandparents chose to get up and rebuild.\nThey set up multilateral institutions, such as the United Nations. They created international financial institutions, such as the World Bank, the IMF and other Bretton Woods institutions.\nAnd they laid the foundations for a rules-based international order through which we enjoyed an unprecedented period of common prosperity in the second half of the twentieth century.\nWe had a system \u2014 we had a generation \u2014 that learned from crisis and set us on a better path.\nIn their era, those systems worked. But that was 50, 60, 70 years ago.\nToday, all those institutions no longer serve us well enough on what they were designed for \u2014 defending multilateralism and international law. Protecting human rights and open markets.\nThat is what the crisis of COVID-19 has shown, beyond a shadow of a doubt. That things have to change. And not just on the world stage \u2014 but at home, too.\nWe are not doing enough for the most vulnerable \u2014 whether it is the elderly, who are dying in health-care facilities, or the homeless, for whom every night is a struggle. We are not going far enough to eliminate systemic injustice, whether it be racism against black or aboriginal people, homophobia or sexism.\nIn the difficulties of our citizens, we can see the failures of our institutions \u2014 of our world.\nAfter the pandemic decimated their economies and basic services, many countries are now on the brink.\nThis is what I heard from so many of you at the meeting on financing for development that Canada hosted last spring with Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the Prime Minister of Jamaica, Andrew Holness.\nWe need to do more to ensure that children around the world are fed and can attend school.\nIf we do not, the consequences will be dire.\nWe are facing a global humanitarian crisis.\nAnd of most concern in all of this is that this pandemic, and the crises it has brought to light, are not even our greatest threat.\nRight now, our world is facing a climate reckoning.\nWe are at this point because of our collective inability, over the past decades, to make the tough decisions and sacrifices needed to fight climate change and save future generations.\nThe pandemic has not changed that. Our shared failures have continued. And our citizens are paying the price.\nWe need a new way of thinking. On climate, on inequality, on health. Because the way we\u2019re doing things just isn\u2019t working well enough.\nToo often, concerted action is blocked \u2014 the needs of our citizens are denied \u2014 as a result of gridlock at decision-making bodies.\nAnd why?\nBecause there are few consequences for countries that ignore international rules. For regimes that think might makes right.\nFew consequences for places where opposition figures are being poisoned while cyber tools and disinformation are being used to destabilize democracies.\nFew consequences when innocent citizens are arbitrarily detained and fundamental freedoms are repressed. When a plane of civilians is shot from the sky. When women\u2019s rights are not treated as human rights. When no one has any rights at all.\nWe are in deadlock.\nThe international approach we\u2019ve relied on since the second half of the 20th century was built on an understanding that countries would work together.\nBut now those same countries are looking inward, and are divided.\nWe need to recognize where we are. The system is broken. The world is in crisis.\nAnd things are about to get much worse unless we change.\nRight now, we have a chance \u2014 not a big chance, but a chance \u2014 to shift course. To realize that the only way through this is together.\nPutting some people ahead of others does not work. A healthier, cleaner, more equal future cannot be the privilege of a lucky few. It must be the right of us all.\nThe only way to make things right and the only way to build a better future for our children and grandchildren is by working together and by standing up for each other, no matter what cards we are dealt.\nThe Rohingyas in Myanmar, the demonstrators in Belarus, the people of Lebanon, the citizens arbitrarily detained in China, the indigenous peoples in Canada and around the world.\nGenuine and constructive global collaboration is the only way forward.\nBut who are we to demand that?\nCanada is not a country that can make a lot of difference on these major international issues. Like so many others, we are subject to the whims of the super Powers.\nBut, as Canadians, we know that we are not alone.\nAs Canadians \u2014 a trading nation where we trace our origins to every corner of the planet \u2014 we know that we are in this together.\nAnd I know other countries \u2014 your countries \u2014 see this too.\nInstead of hunkering down and hoping that we come out the other side ok \u2014 let\u2019s remember that we\u2019re all in this together.\nInstead of crossing our fingers and hoping that the big powers will figure this out \u2014 let\u2019s look at what we can do to make a difference together.\nLet\u2019s use our shared power not just to get a vaccine, but to get it out to everyone. Let us be inspired by our citizens\u2019 call to restore the global economy while we tackle climate change.\nIn other words, let\u2019s not wait for someone else to act.\nLet\u2019s do it ourselves.\nEach one of us, here in these United Nations. Each one of us uniting around a shared future.\nCanada has a long history in peacekeeping and we will continue to step up, and continue to move the dial on lasting peace by empowering women.\nCanada has always supported the work of agencies like UNICEF, the World Food Programme, and the UNHCR. Not only will we keep supporting these efforts, we\u2019ll keep increasing our international assistance budget every year.\nThere\u2019s so much more still to be done.\nChildren all over the world are wearing masks to go to school, or are not going to school at all. Older people are dying. Demonstrators are being killed. Sea levels are rising and forests are burning.\nPeople who think only of themselves continue to increase inequality and conflict.\nIt is time for us, as the United Nations, to join forces and do what we were created to do: to ensure peace and security and to avert global crises.\nThese days we are fighting a battle unlike any other against an invisible virus. At the same time, we are struggling against the consequences of our own actions, which are causing the level of carbon in the atmosphere to become unsustainable.\nEverywhere around the world, people are becoming mindful of this reality. They\u2019re refusing to accept inequality. They\u2019re refusing to close their eyes to the peril we\u2019re facing.\nOur citizens will no longer shrug off as someone else\u2019s problem a failing status quo.\nAnd that\u2019s a good thing. Because there is the path forward.\nAfter a wildfire rips through a forest, life adjusts and begins anew.\nAfter an earthquake hits a city, people work together and rebuild.\nAs we face these layers of crises, this is what we must do.\nWe must understand our opportunities and our responsibilities to take real action, together. To protect each other, to support each other.\nIf we meet this moment, if we rise to this challenge, I know that, like our grandparents did 70 years ago, we will lay the foundations of a better world."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, Excellencies,\nI have the honor to bring you the warm greetings of Iakwe from the Republic of the Marshall Islands. We find the world in an unprecedented crisis - bearing witness not only to a frightening pandemic and its accompanying economic fallout, but also to deep fractures in fundamental international cooperation.\nAs we all reflect on the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, we must realize that continuing with a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d approach risks further inaction at the very moment where the world needs the opposite.\nWithout increased leadership, the consequences for shared responsibility will be catastrophic - be the issue the financial crisis, public health, security tensions, or climate change. As a small island developing state, we can often see threats earlier or more sharply than our larger partner nations - and in the Pacific we can readily recall the deeper history of the Second World War, and the very reasons why the UN was founded. But to rise to meet contemporary challenges, the UN must improve its political relevance and be truly \u201cfit for purpose\u201d in both messaging and delivery.\nMr. President,\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands remains one of the very few nations in the world without a single confirmed case of Covid-19. Like some of our neighbors, we undertook early measures which avoided exposure to our vulnerable population - but which have left us in a deep isolation. Our substantial populations living abroad have been exposed to serious outbreaks. And as our borders remain largely closed, we have struggled to see friends and relatives in danger and pain. Not just in our own population, but around the world, communities are all facing serious challenges - and it is an essential point of humanity that none of us is spared in our suffering.\nThe Pacific Islands Forum, and many multilateral and key bilateral partners have already delivered important assistance to bolster our medical capacity to address outbreaks. Yet we remain in a sharp and growing economic crisis - as one of the busiest tuna ports in the world, our economy is closely - and uniquely - dependent upon fisheries. And the very Covid measures which keep our population safe are also having an adverse impact on our revenue streams. We are fragile, and cutbacks are throwing us backwards in our basic development, at the very time we must be moving forward. It is vital that the international system strengthen approaches which recognize targeted island-tailored economic recovery strategies. We join many others in seeking to \u201cbuild back better\u201d with green resilience through a range of sustainable approaches to benefit key social sectors and the environment, actions we are already taking - but I am also increasingly concerned that without a sharp rise in leadership and multilateral cooperation, we place in doubt the prospect of building back at all.\nMr. President,\nIn these trying moments, the International community cannot forsake core human rights which, regardless of development status, remain universal. As a new member of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, we feel frustrated by the gap between ideals and realities. While there remains a growing list of bad actors who may be far beyond facilitative approaches, the Council must also continue to strengthen its ability to listen closely to vulnerable nations seeking good faith reform and progress. We know from our own history and experience the tragic results which can occur when the voices of the most vulnerable are unheard, or when politics clouds clear reality. The Marshall Islands is particularly concerned that not all are held to full account for human rights obligations - and systematic violations, including those of the largest powers.\nWhile UN efforts to effectively address human rights need continual strengthening, we find unacceptable the persistent efforts to rewrite basic human dignity into an alleged \u201cwin win\u201d language which devalues individual rights. Even if we are in a minority, we will not be silent on this matter.\nMr. President,\nWe reaffirm the 2019 BOE Declaration of the Pacific Islands Forum which establishes a contemporary pathway for regional security. It is vital that, as Small Island developing states, we work with democratic partners to maintain and strengthen our security as truly independent nations not subject to the forceful influence of larger powers. The Marshall Islands underscores the complex security environment in our Pacific region, and the need for a stronger focus on emerging and cross-cutting security drivers within fragile states, including climate change. We want to underscore the urgent need for tangible and text-based efforts towards UN Security Council reform.\nMr. President,\nThe wider Marshall Islands is a nation which is over 99 per cent ocean. We join our fellow Pacific nations in building upon our traditional cultural roles as stewards of the ocean. While small island developing states have a unique role in oceans discussions, a wider global response is needed to ensure that our youngest and future generations will benefit from healthy oceans. The Pacific islands have taken a leading role in working towards more sustainable tuna fishing which also ensures human rights, and a key source of global food security. Yet here too stronger international leadership and political commitment is needed. The economic lifeline in the Pacific is truly fisheries, and we urge for stronger and targeted fisheries development strategies from global finance sources - as a means towards a sustainable and truly secure future economy. This is what we intend as a \u201cblue Pacific.\u201d In this context, we also call on and urge the international community for a more coordinated front, through a UN platform, to combat Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing and related activities.\nWe look forward to realizing a rescheduled UN Oceans Summit in Portugal, as well as the Our Oceans conference in Palau later this year.\nMr. President,\nClimate change is the single greatest threat to the peoples of the Pacific, including in low-lying atoll nations like the Marshall Islands. Curbing emissions now is at the core of the Paris Agreement. But binding words are not enough - change will not come from words alone.\nChange relies on my fellow UN members, major emitters especially, delivering ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions this year. It relies on us all seizing the opportunity posed by the unprecedented scale of economic recovery to create a zero-carbon future. It relies on solidarity, and the resources for us all to build a better future. Change relies on protecting the most vulnerable, because those on the frontline \u2014 whether healthcare workers battling the pandemic or small island nations sounding the alarm on climate change \u2014 are critical to the survival of us all.\nSmall island and atoll nations like mine do not have time for paper promises. Adaptation to climate change will hold off the worst impacts if the world lives up to its promise of 1.5C. But adaptation is also a complex goal at a time when we often struggle to deliver the basics, and requires finances just as our economy is reeling from COVID-19\u2019s effects. There are two things we need to secure our future: for the world to help us adapt to the changes that will come with a 1.5-degree temperature rise, and to make sure that that is the limit.\nMr. President,\nAs a former strategic UN Trusteeship, the Marshall Islands knows all too well the consequences of inaction by the international system. Between 1946 and 1958, 67 large-scale nuclear weapons were tested in the Marshall Islands including many authorized by two UN resolutions. This remains a lasting legacy which is also a contemporary challenge passed down through generations as a significant human rights challenge. No other people should ever have to bear the burdens which we know from nuclear exposure.\nWe remain a beacon for stronger international effort to reduce and eliminate nuclear risk. Real results, not symbolic lip service, is needed to unpack and address the often complex situations which often accompany nuclear risk. In particular, we remain alarmed over recent events in North Korea, and call for full implementation of UN Security Council resolutions.\nMr. President,\nAs small island developing states, the Marshall Islands and our neighbors are forever reminding the UN system and partner nations of the need for island- based strategies which fit our truly unique character. Implementation of the SAMOA Pathway for SIDS remains uneven throughout the UN system, and too often we are left with one-size fits all approaches. Next year we will present our Voluntary National Review of progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We expect to see strong steps forward, including the recent adoption of our national strategic development plan. Yet despite our ambition, so much still remains to be done in further developing an effective UN system which is truly \u201cfit for island purpose\u201d.\nMr. President,\nThe world cannot simply ignore Taiwan, as I can assure it in fact exists, and we must have open minds to ensure the 23 million people of Taiwan are not left behind, nor their humanitarian contributions taken for granted. Taiwan should be allowed to participate in an equal and dignified manner within the UN system, including the WHO, ICAO and the UNFCCC, as well as activities related to the SDGs. The vital civic space of UN premises should be opened for visits and attendance of meetings as well as for the media, regardless of origin.\nMr. President,\nThese are indeed difficult and trying times for international cooperation. Small and vulnerable nations cannot alone move the world. But as small nations, we often have a unique role in realizing creative and dynamic approaches. The UN setting is vital, and as member states we cannot let it further risk irrelevance at the hour when it is most needed. Optimism remains, and the truest test of character is under adversity. Urgent action by all is needed to better act with conviction- and compassion. No nation \u2014 large or small \u2014 can afford the consequences of a fragmented world."

        "file_text": "In the name of God, the most gracious, the most merciful,\nYour Majesties and Excellencies,\nMr. President of the General Assembly,\nMr. Secretary-General of the United Nations,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nIt gives me pleasure to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Volkan Bozkir on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fifth session. I wish him every success as he seeks to revitalize our common endeavour.\nI also wish to express the Kingdom of Morocco\u2019s deep appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande for his efforts to ensure that the General Assembly at its seventy-fourth session has been able to continue its work despite the difficult circumstances imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nI take this opportunity also to express my full appreciation for the role played by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres under these circumstances. We fully support his outstanding leadership over the COVID-19 response, and especially his call for an immediate global ceasefire and his COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan.\nThe convening of the current session of the General Assembly is of the utmost importance, as it takes place in the context of a deadly and highly contagious pandemic, the interrelated global impact of which has undermined the resilience of societies and institutions and forced the world to face unexpected challenges.\nThe pandemic has revealed three major and interrelated crises facing our societies since the turn of the current century, namely, uncontrolled environmental degradation; widening socioeconomic inequalities and increasing poverty levels; and institutional dysfunction in addressing the pandemic, with international cooperation weakened by a lack of effectiveness and coherence in its response to COVID-19.\nThe dangerous manifestations of these crises and the need to find urgent solutions to them are not the result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, they have dominated our societies since the beginning of the third millennium.\nAt the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development, while calling for renewed global solidarity, His Majesty King Mohammed VI wondered whether the various disruptions and violent crises across the world were not enough to constitute a strong argument to convince sceptics that achieving sustainable development was both a collective interest and a collective responsibility.\nToday, we have nine years left to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, and the decisions we make now will determine the success or failure of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nOur commitment is all the more important against the backdrop of the pandemic, as it primarily affects those who are most vulnerable, especially in Africa.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare inequalities that have been deepening over decades. If we had made enough progress in implementing the SDGs, the effects of today\u2019s pandemic would have been less severe.\nMorocco, along with a number of countries, believes that the weaknesses that have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic constitute a real incentive to redouble our efforts and reconsider our development plans in order to ensure that the gains already made are not in vain. This has prompted the Kingdom of Morocco, under the leadership of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, to integrate this vision into a new, integrated development approach.\nSeventy-five years ago, the founders of our Organization laid the foundations of a new global order based on cooperation and solidarity to end wars, prevent their miseries and create the conditions conducive to development and prosperity.\nIt is our firm belief in those noble values that led the Kingdom of Morocco to join the United Nations in 1956 \u2014 one of its first sovereign decisions after gaining independence.\nToday, that vision remains as pertinent as ever. While the United Nations has secured great gains for humankind in the past, we must continue to uphold our responsibility to embody those founding values in the face of critical global threats.\nIt is high time that we undertook reforms that would make the United Nations system more adaptive to the rapidly evolving international changes and more capable of responding swiftly to crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMere statements and speeches are no longer adequate. Now is the time for knowledge-based and results-oriented action.\nNevertheless, the flame of multilateralism continues to burn, as evidenced by the concrete initiatives taken to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Building a multilateral system is not a luxury, but a necessity in order to ensure continued international cooperation, which must provide the framework for confronting the multiple threats, current and future, in a post-COVID-19 world.\nIn that context, establishing a global health security system has become imperative, as expressed by the Secretary-General, who emphasized that the COVID-19 has exposed the cracks in the weak social structures that we built with our own hands.\nThe pandemic has revealed the extent of the damage that new diseases can inflict on national health systems and has demonstrated the importance of adequate emergency preparedness based on a comprehensive approach that unites all stakeholders and communities.\nMorocco\u2019s response to the pandemic has been guided by the strong vision of His Majesty King Mohammed VI. Our proactive and preventive measures have prioritized the health of our citizens and mobilized all institutions and strata of society to address the health emergency.\nMorocco\u2019s support for the Secretary-General\u2019s initiatives to confront COVID-19, as well as the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, reflects our belief in the ability of the United Nations to coordinate and promote all forms of international cooperation to respond to this all-encompassing crisis.\nThat is why the Kingdom of Morocco, in its capacity as the Chair of the Economic and Social Council humanitarian affairs segment, launched a call for action in support of the humanitarian response to combat COVID-19, which enjoyed the support of 171 countries from all regional groups, as well as the African Union and the European Union. The call was inspired by Moroccan diplomatic and humanitarian principles and the noble vision of His Majesty King Mohammed VI.\nIn our view, there is an urgent need to provide vaccines and treatments against COVID-19 in a fair and equitable manner. This would be the most realistic example of a unified global health system and a true test of international cooperation.\nWe must also lay new and flexible foundations for resilience, reform international health regulations and adopt sustainable financing mechanisms.\nIn that connection, together with Rwanda, the World Health Organization and the World Bank, Morocco will organize the first high-level meeting on diplomacy for health security and emergency preparedness in Marrakesh next year.\nMorocco has also joined the initiative led by Chile to adopt a new, flexible legal instrument that would enable effective preparedness for global health emergencies.\nThe pandemic has revealed various vulnerabilities and inequalities within and between societies, countries and continents. It has also proven many of our preconceptions to be incorrect, including the presumed link between underdevelopment and inevitable weakness in certain regions.\nMany of the dire expectations and pessimistic outlooks that some attached to Africa at the beginning of the pandemic did not materialize. Africa has faced the challenge alone, relying on the resilience of its people, the creativity of its youth and the able leadership of its Governments.\nIn the spirit of solidarity that characterizes South-South cooperation vis-a-vis the African countries, His Majesty King Mohammed VI has launched a practical initiative to lay the foundations for a realistic framework to assist African countries throughout the stages of pandemic response.\nAs part of that initiative, Morocco has established air bridges with approximately 20 African countries to transport Moroccan medical aid and pharmaceuticals.\nHowever, in the urgency imposed by the pandemic and its socioeconomic implications, we must not forget the multidimensional and complex challenges that Africa continues to face.\nOne such challenge is the debt crisis. Morocco calls on international financial institutions and partners to adopt and implement concrete guidelines to reduce the debt of the countries concerned in order to curb the effects of the pandemic on their development.\nGlobal economic recovery must be a top priority for the international community. The repercussions of the pandemic also require innovative solutions for the financing of development.\nWhile the pandemic has cast its shadow over vital issues on the Organization\u2019s agenda, this should not be a reason to overlook the other challenges we face, notably climate change, counter-terrorism, migration and peacekeeping.\nIn that regard, we must express our appreciation for the efforts of the United Nations and countries contributing to peacekeeping operations to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic and to enable the 100,000 peacekeepers currently deployed in 13 peacekeeping operations to continue their missions in various conflict areas.\nMorocco believes in the importance of peacekeeping reform in light of the complexities of contemporary conflicts and remains committed to achieving the goals of the Action for Peacekeeping initiative.\nIn that context, Morocco and France, in cooperation with the United Nations, will organize the second Francophone ministerial conference on peacekeeping.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco remains committed to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, namely, the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes and respect for the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of States.\nIn that connection, Morocco remains committed to finding a definitive solution to the regional dispute over the Moroccan Sahara, in line with its territorial integrity and national sovereignty.\nMorocco\u2019s position is unambiguous. The search for a definitive political solution can succeed only if it meets four basic criteria: first, the full sovereignty of Morocco over its desert and the self-autonomy initiative as the only solution to this contrived dispute; secondly, the full participation of all parties in the search for a definitive solution to this contrived dispute; thirdly, full respect for the principles and criteria set forth by the Security Council in all its resolutions since 2007, namely, that a solution must be political, realistic, practical, sustainable and consensus-based; and fourthly, the rejection of any other proposal aimed at steering the political process away from the terms of reference determined by the Security Council. Both the Secretary-General and the Council rejected such a proposal more than 20 years ago.\nThe political process, under the sole sponsorship of the United Nations, has seen new momentum. Two round table meetings were held in Geneva, in December 2018 and March 2019 respectively, where all of the parties concerned convened for the first time. It is particularly encouraging to note that the Security Council considers this process to be the only path towards a realistic, practical, enduring and consensus-based political solution to this regional dispute.\nThe Kingdom of Morocco once again expresses its deep concern about the dire humanitarian situation faced by the inhabitants of the Tindouf camps. The host country has authorized an armed separatist group to take charge of the camps, in flagrant violation of its international obligations under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and other international conventions relating to human rights and international humanitarian law.\nIn the context of COVID-19, concerns are mounting over the fate of those populations stranded in camps run by an armed group with no legal status under international law.\nIt is time for the international community to take decisive action to compel the host country to allow the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to conduct a census and registration of the population in those camps, in accordance with international humanitarian law for refugees and the urgent calls made by the Security Council in all of its related resolutions since 2011. This is essential in order to put an end to the 40-year-long diversion of humanitarian assistance intended for those stranded inside the Tindouf camps.\nThe security of the Kingdom of Morocco is intrinsically linked to the security of Libya, the sister State with which we share a common history and destiny. Nine years after the outbreak of the crisis in Libya, its security and humanitarian situation continue to deteriorate due to foreign interference, including military intervention.\nThe only solution to that crisis is a political one decided upon by the Libyans themselves, with the support of the international community but free from foreign interference and agendas, as affirmed by the meeting in Skhirat.\nMorocco remains committed to providing a neutral forum for dialogue between the Libyan parties. In the second week of September, we hosted meetings in Bouznika between the High Council of State and the Tobruk Parliament, which culminated in a comprehensive agreement on transparent and objective criteria and mechanisms in order to fill key leadership positions with the aim of unifying them.\nThe failure to settle the Palestinian question and resume the Middle East peace process is a source of grave concern for the Kingdom of Morocco. There cannot be a just or lasting peace for the Palestinian people unless they are able to exercise their legitimate right to establish an independent and viable Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\nMorocco therefore categorically rejects all unilateral measures taken by the Israeli authorities in the occupied Palestinian territories, whether in the West Bank or in Al-Quds Al-Sharif. Such measures will only fuel tension and instability in the region.\nHis Majesty King Mohammed VI, in his capacity as Chair of the Al-Quds Committee of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, stresses the importance of preserving the Holy City of Jerusalem, as it is a common heritage of humankind and a symbol of peaceful coexistence among the followers of the three monotheistic religions. It is also a centre for mutual respect and dialogue. This was reaffirmed in the Jerusalem appeal that His Majesty signed with His Holiness Pope Francis in Rabat on 30 March 2019.\nI must express the Kingdom\u2019s heartfelt condolences and solidarity with brotherly Lebanon in the aftermath of the explosion at the port in Beirut, with its painful material and human losses. At the request of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, the Kingdom provided medical and humanitarian assistance to the Lebanese people in the hope of alleviating the suffering of those affected by that tragic incident.\nWe must turn the COVID-19 pandemic into an opportunity to rebuild a more effective and efficient multilateral system. To do so, we must conduct a comprehensive assessment of the failures of the multilateral system and its institutions in facing the crisis, as well as its achievements towards building a sound basis for good practices in the future. We must also refocus multilateral action on the principles of solidarity, cooperation and responsibility, while taking the appropriate measures to put an end to all conflicts through concrete and practical multilateral initiatives.\nMorocco, in its firm adherence to the multilateral framework, remains committed to working with likeminded States to create a more just, united and transparent global system.\nThat was the commitment made by His Majesty King Mohammed VI at the Millennium Summit, where he reaffirmed that, as we embarked upon a new millennium, it was our solemn duty to set new goals for humankind, while acting with justice and solidarity.\nMay the peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you."

        "file_text": "In the name of God the Merciful and the Compassionate,\nMay God bless the most honourable of Messengers,\nMr. President,\nYour Majesties,\nExcellencies,\nSecretary-General of the United Nations,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nAt the outset, I would like to warmly congratulate His Excellency Ambassador Volkan Bozkir, Permanent Representative of the sisterly Republic of Turkey, on assuming the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly at its seventy-fifth session. I wish him every success in his new tasks.\nI would also like to express my sincere thanks and gratitude to Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, Permanent Representative of our sisterly State of Nigeria, for the high skill and professionalism with which he steered the previous session of the United Nations General Assembly.\nIn this regard, I would like to pay tribute to His Excellency the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, for his continued great efforts and endeavours to reform and lead the Organization in the service of international peace and security.\nThis session is being held in extremely complex global circumstances due to the health crisis caused by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has cast its shadow on various aspects of life in all countries of the world. Its tragic repercussions and challenges have caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people in various countries and have totally paralysed the global economic system.\nThis crisis has also exposed the weaknesses of current measures, which means that we all must unite our efforts to contain and mitigate its economic impact, in particular on developing countries, whose economic systems have been severely affected by the crisis.\nWe in the Islamic Republic of Mauritania have taken the measures necessary to reduce the spread and effect of the virus and to particularly protect the poorest in society. The most important of these measures is to monitor local markets and replenish them with the basic needs to prevent price hikes, ensure the availability of basic medicines at fixed prices and provide assistance to thousands of vulnerable and poor families hard hit by the economic recession.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had negative repercussions on our national economy and the economies of our African neighbours. It has caused a decline in gross domestic product. That has led to a decrease in tax revenue, increased spending and budget deficit. We therefore reiterate our call from this rostrum to eliminate the external debt of African countries in order to enable them to cope with the pandemic and its social and economic consequences.\nThis year, we celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the founding of our prestigious Organization. Let us also take this opportunity to consider ways to improve its performance as we seek to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 and overcome major global challenges in the areas of the environment, climate, health, education, security, stability and development.\nIn that regard, His Excellency the President of the Republic, Mr. Mohamed Ould Cheikh El Ghazouani, has announced an economic programme focused on the following: fostering the infrastructure to support growth; promoting capacity-building in social sectors to stimulate demand; upgrading and supporting the productive sectors to achieve self-sufficiency in food production; supporting the entire private sector; combating desertification and drought; and increasing employment opportunities. The programme will enable us to ensure that our economy supports public policy, with a strategy of accelerated growth and common prosperity that is more inclusive and environmentally friendly, in order to make greater progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.\nWe have exerted great efforts to implement projects and programmes aimed at combating various forms of injustice, marginalization and vulnerabilities by securing universal access to basic services and supporting the health and educational systems. That is in addition to strengthening national unity, fostering social cohesion, calming the political arena, building a State of law, protecting freedoms and establishing the rules of good governance.\nWe also continue to work to develop the educational system so as to instil in our generations the principles of freedom, tolerance and openness, based on our cultural and civilizational constants. The goal is to raise the quality of our education and develop its scientific and professional aspects as required by the national economy.\nWith regard to the fight against poverty, we have also focused on addressing social disparities and marginalization while supporting the most vulnerable and fostering social solidarity. We established the Agency for National Solidarity and the Fight against Exclusion and have launched a series of ambitious projects aimed at improving employment and livelihoods, improving purchasing power and facilitating access to basic services, such as electricity, drinking water, health and education.\nIn addition, programmes have been developed to train young people and help them to enter the labour market, thereby contributing to the development of the national economy. Considerable efforts have been made to help women play their role by participating fully in political life and public affairs.\nIn order to achieve sustainable development, we focus on an independent judiciary, the protection of human rights, promoting democracy and individual and collective freedoms, freedom of the press, the transparency of political institutions, ensuring that the Parliament plays its role in oversight and accountability, securing transparency as a comprehensive approach in managing public affairs and the development of legal and regulatory mechanisms to eliminate corruption and bribery.\nThere can be no development without security and vice versa. The Islamic Republic of Mauritania has been keen to develop an effective strategy to combat terrorism and various forms of extremism with a comprehensive approach that takes the ideological, security, economic and social dimensions into account. When we chaired the work of the Group of Five for the Sahel, we, along with our regional and international partners, engaged in intense consultations to develop a road map that would neutralize terrorism and dry up its sources of funding. In that regard, our country took part in various meetings and hosted two summits that enabled us to make progress in the fight against violent extremism in the Sahel region. That fight must be fully respectful of human rights.\nFor decades, the countries of the Maghreb have endured the consequences of the dispute in Western Sahara. Mauritania maintains its consistent and unbiased position. We have excellent relations with all parties concerned and support the efforts of the United Nations and all relevant Security Council resolutions aimed at finding a sustainable and acceptable solution for all parties.\nWith regard to the crisis in Mali, we have successfully exerted mediation efforts to enable President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita to travel abroad for treatment. We also called on the parties to the crisis to push forward an agreement on outstanding issues in order to return to constitutional status. I take this opportunity to applaud the efforts of the current Malian authorities and the Economic Community of West African States to resolve the crisis at the earliest and ensure a return to constitutional life in the country.\nWe also stress that we remain on the side of just causes in all international forums. We reiterate our firm commitment to the right of the Palestinian people to dignity and sovereignty within the framework of an independent and viable State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, in accordance with the Arab Peace Initiative and relevant international resolutions. We also reiterate our condemnation of the ongoing human rights violations by Israel in Palestine and the remaining Arab territories.\nIn Libya, we also support international efforts to bring peace to that brotherly country and ensure its unity and sovereignty.\nWith regard to the situation in the Syrian Arab Republic, we stress the need to seriously pursue a political solution to preserve the unity of that brotherly Arab country, its independence, its people\u2019s dignity and its right to a secure and peaceful life.\nWith respect to Yemen, we stress our support for legitimacy and call for a peaceful solution in accordance with relevant Arab initiatives and international resolutions. At the same time, we condemn the terrorist attacks on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia which target its national security.\nMay peace and God\u2019s mercy and blessings be upon you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, Ladies and Gentlemen, Heads of State and Government, Ambassadors and Ambassadors, Delegates and Delegates.\nBenito Perez Galdos was an outstanding Spanish writer, from the Canary Islands, and we are commemorating the centenary of his death this very year. On a certain occasion, he regretfully observed that \u201cit is sad to observe that only adversity makes men brothers.\u201d It is sad, but we see it all the time: we human beings only behave as brothers and sisters when we feel threatened by the same misfortune.\nCOVID-19 is the great crisis of our generation. And this emergency-more than a thousand treaties or speeches \u2014 has made us suddenly realize that we belong to a single world.\nWe had already been seriously forewarned. Ebola, a virus that was identified for the first time in a river in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, spread throughout several African countries and later jumped to Europe.\nAlready a variant of the influenza virus A suffered a mutation and jumped from a pig to a human in the state of Veracruz, Mexico, leading to what was later known as the swine flu, causing tens of thousands of deaths in several continents.\nNow, this very year, an outbreak initially located in a market in Wuhan brought the entire world to a standstill for months, and has plunged humankind into the worst crisis of this century.\nThe health, economic and social consequences of COVID-19 are only comparable to what humankind suffered during the 1918 Influenza Pandemic, the Great Depression, or the Second World War.\nThe virus is affecting all of humanity, regardless of ideology, borders or fortunes. But poverty is working hand in hand with the virus. Poverty has proven to be the factor that can aggravate or diminish anything. The pandemic has exacerbated difficulties and inequalities. The pandemic has widened the injustice and vulnerability gap. In Eswatini, that small country in southern Africa, one thousand women contracted HIV every single day of last year. Schools, safe and exclusive spaces were created for young women and adolescent girls. Eswatini was winning the fight against AIDS ten years ahead of schedule. But a pandemic not only widens gaps\u2014it stops progress. It stops hope.\nThe virus does not care about technology. But when societies have been forced to react against the pandemic, when they have reduced personal contacts, even when they have resorted to confinement, when they have sought to keep on with their work, with their education, with their leisure activities, with their social lives... It is then that digitalization has proven to be the most effective alternative for maintaining social activity.\nNor does the virus infect selectively by gender. But when it has hit large numbers of people, once again women have taken on the essential burden of caregiving.\nNor, lastly, does the virus take into consideration the environment or climate change. But this terrible health emergency has made us realize the true meaning of the term climate emergency: a threat against which the only vaccine is humanity\u2019s united response.\nThese four factors, together with this most pressing health emergency, are the challenges we are facing:\nThe challenge of the climate emergency; The challenge of technological progress and the fourth industrial revolution linked to digitalization. The challenge of overcoming excruciating inequalities and poverty; The challenge of full equality between women and men and the eradication of any form of discrimination based on gender, race or origin.\nThe first of these challenges concerns the climate emergency. And if we look at a picture of our world, we will be excited to see that the ozone hole is slowly healing, thanks to the Montreal Protocol, which bound governments to drastically reduce their CFC emissions. This is a real, tangible example that proves that where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way. Yet another success story is that of the Antarctic Treaty, which protects all of the Earth\u2019s territory south of parallel 60 against any interference, ensuring that it may only be used for scientific purposes.\nAnd we can achieve the Sustainable Development Goals regarding climate, life below water, and terrestrial ecosystems if we set our minds to it. This Assembly is the appropriate forum to reflect on the impact of the pandemic on the Sustainable Development Goals and on the Decade of Action. The 2021 High-Level Political Forum should be held, exceptionally, at the Heads of State and Government level, to agree upon urgent measures that will enable us to achieve the Goals we set for ourselves five years ago\nWe cannot let down our guard or be complacent, because everything still remains to be done. So far this year, two million hectares have gone up in flames in California. An island of plastic three times the size of France is floating in the Pacific Ocean and destroying our marine ecosystems. And desertification and drought are severely threatening the livelihoods of more than 1.2 billion people all around the world, producing intolerable migration flows.\nAnd, above all, we know that we have very little time left to prevent the climate crisis from becoming irreversible. This is why it makes no sense for any public official to disregard the Paris Agreement and its commitments for action.\nThe second challenge is linked to the fourth industrial revolution and to digitalization. The past two centuries have seen the global income multiply by more than 20, in contrast with the stagnation of the world\u2019s economy in previous centuries. Since then, a series of industrial revolutions has led to a shift in work activity from agriculture to industry and then to services, and to an increase in productivity and consumption, which in turn have increased well-being and life expectancy, albeit in a painfully unequal manner.\nThe fourth industrial revolution we are witnessing is of unprecedented scope and speed, and may change every sphere of life for better or for worse. It may provide more leisure or generate more unemployment; it may foster human knowledge or lead to the control and manipulation of people; it may promote the progress of all humankind or intensify inequalities. The following figure illustrates this contrast: 40% of the European Union\u2019s GDP is soon expected to stem from digital activities. Meanwhile, in Africa barely four out of every ten people have internet access.\nDigitalization also offers huge potential for emission reduction and for curbing the climate emergency. Artificial intelligence applied to big data and the internet of things facilitate more efficient logistics and transportation, emissions reduction, less aggressive mining and agriculture, the use of renewable energy, and a more circular economy.\nThe third challenge involves reducing inequalities. I represent a progressive government that has championed the eradication of child poverty and the reduction of inequalities within our borders. But beyond the specific leanings of each government, we must remember that even those who defend certain degrees of inequality distinguish between what they call \u201cconstructive inequality\u201d and \u201coppressive inequality\u201d. Poverty is an intolerable and oppressive form of inequality, which not only constitutes blatant injustice, but is also an impediment to social progress.\nAnd this inequality exists within each country, as well as between countries. Studies have shown that differences in mean per capita incomes between countries account for more than 85 per cent of global inequality. Therefore, to address inequality we must take action within each country, but also, above all, we must narrow the gap between different countries\u2019 incomes.\nThe fourth major challenge is achieving full, total, absolute equal rights for women. The progress already made is incalculable. In education, in civil rights, in labour rights... We can see young women leading movements against climate change, we can see other young women dressed in white conquering the streets in the East, and young black women leading demonstrations in the West. Inspired by other women who obtain academic qualifications living in the desert, who own small businesses in their villages, who lead countries, or take pictures of black holes. Women who are in those positions thanks to the sacrifices made by other women in the past, such as Rosa Parks, Marie Curie, Marsha P. Johnson and Domitila Barrios.\nBut it is impossible to ignore how far away we are from achieving Sustainable Development Goal Five, because female genital mutilation is still taking place, we are witnessing a spike in misogynistic violence, and the gender gap remains wide open.\nSeventy-five years after the Charter of the United Nations was signed in San Francisco, as leaders of the world\u2019s different peoples, we have more reasons than ever for stepping up to this platform of peace and progress with answers and actions. Last Monday we unanimously adopted a declaration to commemorate this anniversary of the United Nations. It is a text that looks ahead to the future; let us realize its vision. Let us turn good intentions into specific measures.\nWe need to save this planet, our only home. We need to align the digitalization of the economy throughout the world. We need to eradicate poverty and reduce oppressive social inequalities. We also need to put an end to inequality between men and women, and to all forms of inequality based on beliefs, sexual orientation and gender identity.\nMultilateralism And we can only achieve this if we act united. The pandemic that we are enduring, and all that has happened in these past months, reminds us of the practical and moral imperative to act in unity. This is totally contrary to the positions of those who, for some time now, have been questioning the multilateral system and eroding its foundations.\nHow can we ask the World Health Organization to lead the response to the pandemic effectively if its resources keep dwindling?\nHow can we champion an open, interconnected world, where citizens are free and have a greater quality of life, if we demonize immigration and backtrack on international trade rules?\nHow can we advance in the defence of human rights and in the protection of world heritage if we turn our backs on the initiatives created for this purpose?\nThere is no doubt that the system represented by the United Nations needs reforms and updates. But the only acceptable solution is that of improving it. Because we know only too well where regression to nationalism and protectionism will lead us: to inequality, to heightened tension and, ultimately, to confrontation.\nA world divided by distrust and conflict, or a global, more just, and safer world: this is the choice we are facing.\nThe interdependence of nations is an undisputed fact, and the pandemic has served as a reminder. But it is not enough to invoke unity of action as an abstract, empty principle. We need to believe in unity. Unity enables us to advance together. Unity averts conflicts. Unity saves lives. Unity, and unity alone, can save the planet. And we must act. We must take further steps. And we must take them now. On specific issues, with specific decisions.\nThe urgency of the current moment shows us that there is only one way to strengthen multilateralism: by defending Global Public Goods along the five main lines that must guide the rebuilding of the multilateral architecture:\nFirstly, we must strengthen the global health system. It is time to equip the World Health Organization with new tools, following the expert opinions of the independent evaluation committee; to sign a Global Compact for Health, based on the 2030 Agenda; and to lead a socioeconomic recovery that bolsters national capacities for tackling new pandemics, achieving universal health coverage. At the same time, we must guarantee equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. This is not only the most effective option from a medical standpoint; it is also an absolute and non-negotiable moral imperative.\nSecondly, we must step up our climate-ambition commitments. Once again, we are left with no real choice: the current emergency demands that we act boldly to reach a global agreement that will safeguard the protection of biodiversity by 2030, and this agreement must encompass energy and ecological transitions towards a sustainable model of production.\nThirdly, we must reinforce the multilateral system so as to maintain international peace and security. Wars shackle entire generations in poverty and distress. There is no security without development, nor development without security. And we cannot look the other way, we cannot simply ignore the multiple conflicts that continue to blight the lives of millions of people, and hope for partial solutions. The fate of such people is also our own.\nWe must promote the negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis to reach a just peace agreement respecting the two-state solution.\nWe must support a negotiated way out of the conflict in Libya. Urgent action is required to restore peace and security in the Sahel. A just, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution must be found to the Western Sahara conflict, in accordance with Security Council resolutions and within the framework of provisions pursuant to the Purposes and Principles of the UN Charter\nWe will continue to support UN efforts in those places where they are successful, such as Sudan; but also in those areas in which it needs the unanimous backing of the international community, such as in the fight against the weapons proliferation or in the application of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\nOf particular interest to Spain is the status of Gibraltar following the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union. On this matter, we are called to comply with United Nations doctrine on Gibraltar, with which Spain is fully aligned. We wish to work towards developing an area of social and economic prosperity that encompasses the entire area of Gibraltar and Campo de Gibraltar.\nFourthly, we must work harder than ever to defend democracy and human rights, promoting the protection of individuals, organizations, communities and networks at the international and local levels. Democracy is much more than merely a form of government: it is a way of life, furnished with values for humanity as a whole, making no distinction between people on the basis of their origin or condition, and requiring all our efforts and good example to successfully combat those who oppose it.\nFifthly and finally, we must commit to financial multilateralism. International financial institutions are called to play a critical role in overcoming this global crisis, contributing to the development of green and digital technology, particularly in the health, education and communications sectors.\nCertain regions, such as Latin America and the Caribbean, are submerged in the deepest economic crisis they have known since World War Two. This is why I convened a High-Level Conference in June: to call on the international financial institutions to extend support to the region. A country\u2019s income level cannot be the sole criterion by which it is accorded access to international financing instruments. We must rethink the system so that the most vulnerable nations classified as middle- income countries can also receive the international support necessary to reactivate their economies.\nSimilarly, it is crucial that we speed up the reform process of the World Trade Organization, reviewing the rules that will enable us to strengthen global production and distribution chains without resorting to closing any borders.\nClosing remarks\nRight at this moment, in every corner of the globe, there is a young person staring at the screen of their cell phone. In the backstreets of Naples, at a fish auction in Istanbul, in Mexico City\u2019s Zocalo square, in the equatorial Amazon, or at a market in India. These young people have seen their parents working non-stop, day-in, day-out, year after year, without any change. In Villa El Salvador, on the outskirts of Lima, in Tangier, in Popasna. In Villa El Salvador, on the outskirts of Lima, in Tangier, in Popasna. All over the world. Perhaps they wonder why their parents work so hard if nothing around them ever changes. If nothing around them ever gets any better. If there is nothing that transforms and improves their lives. If there is no glimmer of hope in sight.\nIn most parts of the world, when young people look around them, they can see no life opportunities. Instead, they see that the doors to progress and personal advancement are closing; they are seeing the environment deteriorating before their very eyes.\nExactly when did we decide that the expression \u201cto change the world\u201d had lost all sense and meaning?\nI wonder if any of those millions of young people are watching us right now on their mobile phones. I wonder what they are thinking of us, if so. There is another virus spreading across the world right now: its symptoms are disappointment, ennui, distrust and indifference. And these symptoms are suffered by all of these young people listening to us \u2014 or who, regrettably, are not listening to us \u2014 from every corner of the globe. We infect them with this virus every time we allow a new dispute to come between us; every time we renege on an agreement; every time we turn our backs on our commitments and responsibilities to other countries.\nWhether due to inaction or omission, we have allowed disaffection and distrust of government to spread across the globe. Whether due to indifference or cowardice, we have ignored threats and realities that seriously affect the physical, political and moral health of the planet today. We are witnessing the resurgence of exclusionary and xenophobic nationalisms, of autarkic delusions, of blatant authoritarianisms. We are seeing the rise of leaderships based on demagogy, lies and the fuelling of hate.\nIn the face of such insidious developments, I would like to call on the international community. To appeal to them to understand this historic moment; an appeal stemming from the urgency of these times in which we are living and from fervent convictions.\nFor the sake of young people, we are morally obliged to act. To act for all, but especially for those who are listening to us in disbelief and indifference. We cannot condemn young people, for the first time in two centuries, to a world that is worse than before, a world that is more unjust, more hopeless, to a future of resignation with no alternatives. We cannot and must not leave the future of our young people in the hands of those intent on putting up yet again the physical and ideological borders we worked so hard to tear down.\nWe must be proactive. It is essential to understand that many of the ideas that have determined the social order and the economic development of the world during the past decades have ceased to be viable. The health emergency that we are enduring, the climate emergency, the successive crises and recessions, clearly reflect the depletion and failure of that model.\nWe cannot continue to aspire to rampant, unnatural growth. We cannot build a world based on the destruction of guaranteed public services or of the environment in which we live.\nWe cannot continue to nurture the fiction of a progress that only means greater injustice and inequality for millions of human beings.\nWe cannot continue to tell young people that all it takes to realize their dreams is hard work unless we make equal opportunities a reality.\nPresident, dear friends.\nToday, those who are here together in this virtual space have the historic, moral, urgent and unavoidable duty to act in unity to offer the world a new horizon of growth and progress.\nToday, we have a duty to offer young people hope.\nThis is our greatest responsibility, especially to those young people who are not listening to us today. We have lost their attention because they do not believe we have anything to offer. And it is these young people who will judge us.\nThank you very much."

        "file_text": "Mr. President of the General Assembly,\nMr. Secretary General of the Organization,\nLadies and Gentlemen of all ranks and titles,\nDistinguished delegates,\nAllow me, at the outset, to commend His Excellency Mr. Volkan Bozkir of Turkey on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fifth session. The unanimous vote is a token of recognition and a guarantee of the success of the work the General Assembly at this ordinary session.\nI would also like to commend the remarkable work of His Excellency Ambassador Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, who led the work of the seventy-fourth session with great dexterity, despite the difficulties related to the coronavirus pandemic.\nAt the same time, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, on his courageous and ambitious initiatives aimed at strengthening the effectiveness and efficiency of the United Nations system for the common good of our planet.\nMr. President,\nOur world is currently facing a major health crisis caused by COVID-19. The multidimensional consequences of the virus, coupled with new conflicts and asymmetric wars, terrorism and violent extremism, global socioeconomic inequalities and climate change, demand our response.\nToday, more than ever, we need a more cohesive and effective multilateral system that will enable the States Members of the Organization to develop strategies to address challenges and achieve the holistic vision of a better future for all, in accordance with the Declaration on the Commemoration of the Seventy-fifth Anniversary of the United Nations on the future we want.\nMr. President,\nIt is no coincidence that \u201ceradicating poverty in all its forms and throughout the world\u201d is the number one goal of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nIt is unfortunate to note that global efforts to implement that central objective are far from meeting real needs. Even today, a large percentage of the world\u2019s population still suffers from poverty and hunger. We will not be able to reverse this trend without a broad mobilization of financial resources.\nThere is still a striking gap between the commitments we have made and the actions underway to eradicate world poverty. Haiti has received several billion US dollars in aid from the international community over the past 10 years.\nHowever, the living conditions of Haitians have not improved. The billions of dollars spent have often not taken into account our priorities, our needs or even our strategy to fight poverty.\nFrom a sustainable development perspective, we call on donors and all friendly countries to conduct a critical analysis of international aid to Haiti in order to assess its effectiveness.\nWe want projects that are adapted to our needs, that respond to our priorities and that allow us to implement economic development focused on people, on national production and on strengthening the capacities of our institutions. We want projects that have a positive impact on poverty and that integrate the country\u2019s social and environmental issues.\nSome donors are beginning to understand the need to align themselves with the will of the Government of the Republic of Haiti in choosing its priorities. We congratulate them!\nMr. President,\nWe are 10 years away from the target date for the universal achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Many countries have already made significant progress towards this goal.\nOthers, despite their efforts, are still lagging behind. In Haiti, our emergency, recovery and long-term development needs remain immense and require consistent investment in several areas. From where my country currently stands, the pursuit of sustainable development objectives is a major challenge.\nMajor and sustained efforts must be deployed in priority areas such as road, agricultural, electrical, digital, port and airport infrastructures; education; health coverage; social housing; the mobilization of foreign direct investment; reforestation; environmental protection; revival of agricultural production; universal access to energy from renewable sources; and universal access to credit, especially for young people and farmers.\nMr. President,\nI am fully aware of my responsibility to ensure that the essential conditions are in place to guarantee Haiti\u2019s long-term security, stability and development. My Administration, which has been facing a complex socioeconomic crisis and the excessive and violent polarization of the political class for several months now, will not be able to deal with it alone. The Republic of Haiti will recover, but only with sustained, coherent, effective and well-coordinated support from the international community.\nToday, the Republic of Haiti has been stripped of an institution that is indispensable to the smooth functioning of democracy: its Parliament. We have established a new Provisional Electoral Council to conduct credible, transparent, inclusive, free, honest and democratic elections.\nFaithful to its historic traditions, the Republic of Haiti has always strived to promote and defend the values and principles of universal freedoms, lasting peace and cooperation among nations around the world.\nIn that regard, my country continues to stand alongside the Member States of the international community that wish to build a more just and balanced world order, in accordance with the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations.\nIt is in this spirit that I welcome the initiative of the Secretary-General, who has made relevant proposals to reform the Organization. I encourage him to intensify his efforts to strengthen the United Nations so that it is can match up to the new challenges of the twenty-first century.\nTo that end, I encourage all States to commit not only to developing a common understanding and taking collective action in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, but to accelerating the implementation of action programmes in line with the three pillars of the United Nations, namely development, peace and security and human rights.\nTo Member States,\nWhile I offer my sincere condolences to the countries that have been greatly affected by COVID-19, I would like to thank all the partner countries that have helped the Haitian State to better manage the pandemic, in particular the Republic of China (Taiwan).\nIt is time for the world to recognize this nation\u2019s right to exist and afford it its rightful place in international forums, particularly the United Nations.\nIn conclusion, Mr. President, I would like, on this exceptional occasion, to invite the members of the General Assembly to reflect and meditate on this concise yet crucial quote by C. Wilfred Jenks on the future of peace, development and security in the world: \u201cThe choice is simple yet brutal: either we live together, or we perish together\u201d.\nI thank you."

        "file_text": "Mr. Chairman of the General Assembly,\nMr. Secretary-General,\nExcellencies,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nI would like to congratulate Ambassador Volkan Bozkir on his election as President of the General Assembly as the United Nations (UN) celebrates its seventy- fifth anniversary.\nMore than ever, the UN is needed to address challenges that know no borders and cannot be resolved by self-interested approaches.\nWe know to what degree the multilateral system is under pressure.\nFirst of all, in the context of a return to a competition for power at the global level, we are witnessing increasing limitations on the ability to respond to shared threats and challenges.\nSecondly, new issues are emerging that demand multilateral solutions in accordance with normative and cooperative arrangements. What is know called the fourth industrial revolution presents both a challenge and an opportunity. From artificial intelligence and robotization to the implementation of smart grids and 5G infrastructure and data management, to restructuring entire sectors of the economy, the impact of new technologies \u2014 on the economy, the work world and relations among States \u2014 will demand new rules of conduct at the international level. The UN must play a central role in defining them by providing compromise solutions capable of safeguard the public interest.\nThirdly, international organizations are showing difficulty in responding to challenges and threats. The Security Council is a case in point. It has demonstrated its limited capacity to respond to crises and conflicts, while its membership does not reflect the geopolitical realities of the twenty-first century. That is why Portugal advocates the expansion of the categories of permanent and non-permanent members, including for the African continent and, at least, Brazil and India.\nDespite such challenges, the UN remains crucial to preserving world peace and security, sustainable development and the defence and the promotion of human rights. And the General Assembly, which I am addressing, continues to be the Parliament of humankind. There is no other.\nPortugal will therefore continue to resolutely support the United Nations system both politically and financially. We will uphold the ambitious agenda of commitments to strengthen the capacity of the UN and its Member States in responding to the major areas of international interest, including the Sustainable Development Goals, climate change, migration, hosting refugees, issues related to the sea and the sustainability of the oceans.\nThe leadership and reforms introduced by the Secretary-General are essential to making the Organization\u2019s work more effective and flexible. He can therefore count on our full support.\nMr. President,\nMr. Secretary-General,\nThe context of the global emergency that we are experiencing today reinforces the need for cooperation among States and international organizations to respond to the challenge of the health crisis and its socioeconomic consequences. The United Nations is a central pillar to such efforts, including through the United Nations System Response to COVID-19, a response plan endorsed by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. We support its implementation and the coordinating role of the World Health Organization.\nThe pandemic has highlighted many of our vulnerabilities in the areas of health, the economy and social cohesion. We need to swiftly recover growth and employment and increase the resilience of our economies, societies and the State. This will be a key priority for Portugal when, in the first half of 2021, the country holds the presidency of the Council of the European Union.\nSimilarly, there is a need to strengthen development cooperation and the capacity of the United Nations system for action in this area. Portugal has strengthened its contributions to several United Nations agencies, focusing in particular on the World Health Organization, the International Organization for Migration, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Food Programme and UNICEF.\nThe fight against economic inequalities deserves special attention given its truly cross-cutting nature. International security is incompatible with an inequitable distribution of resources on a global scale, in particular when compounded by demographic imbalances and issues related to environmental deterioration that are so often inseparable. We need a new global commitment based on human dignity that balances concrete access to opportunities and hope.\nThe crisis caused by this pandemic must not therefore serve as an excuse to disrupt policies aimed at countering the current climate emergency, which poses an existential threat to everyone. On the contrary, there is a need to deepen the coordination between the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, thereby helping to build societies that are less vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events.\nSimilarly, it is essential to deepen the relationship between oceans and climate change, while paying special attention to small island States. Therefore, Portugal reaffirms its commitment to co-hosting in 2021, together with Kenya, the United Nations Ocean Conference and counts on the participation of all UN Member States, at the highest level.\nMr. President,\nSecretary-General,\nThe full realization of human rights is an ongoing process of improvement. Portugal supports an open discussion, as part of a critical dialogue among peers, to strengthen the promotion and universal respect for human rights. Together with our partners in the European Union, we reaffirm the defence of free, plural and tolerant societies that reject racism, xenophobia, homophobia and populism and that work for inclusion, gender equality and freedom of expression.\nThe pandemic has placed new demands on the promotion and protection of human rights. Portugal has provided an immediate response to these demands, in particular by expanding access to the National Health Service to all migrants and refugees, regardless of their status or legal situation, under the same conditions as for national citizens.\nPortugal has played an active role in welcoming migrants and refugees, thereby expressing its solidarity in an undeniable way. We reaffirm our full support for the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. Furthermore, within the framework of the International Organization for Migration, we are one of the pilot countries for its implementation.\nPortugal is one of the first countries to abolish the death penalty, opposing its use in all circumstances. In this regard, I call for the adoption of the biennial resolution on the moratorium on the use of the death penalty, which will be introduced during this session of the General Assembly.\nIn a year marking quarter of a century since the fourth World Conference on Women, Portugal reiterates its commitment to the promotion of women\u2019s rights. It is important to double the attention paid to gender-based violence and sexual and reproductive rights and health in the face of the challenges exacerbated by the pandemic.\nMr. President,\nSecretary-General,\nDespite the pandemic, many wars and conflicts persist. That is why we support the recent call by the Secretary-General for a global ceasefire.\nPortugal currently provides troops to seven peacekeeping operations and special political missions. Our national participation in MINUSCA, in the Central African Republic, is an example, in particular because it provides the Rapid Reaction Force, which is crucial to the fulfilment of the Mission\u2019s mandate.\nThe persistence of high levels of violence in the Sahel reinforces the need for international coordination \u2014 a goal supported by Portugal, in particular through our participation in MINUSMA in Mali.\nWe monitor the international community\u2019s efforts to find political solutions to the conflicts that plague many parts of the world. We believe that the two-State solution is the only way to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; that the nuclear agreement with Iran must be preserved and fully respected by all parties and that the mediation and compromise processes led by the UN are those that will make it possible to overcome the deep crises today in Syria, Yemen and Libya. We also call for a peaceful and inclusive political solution in Venezuela.\nThe current challenges demonstrate the importance of international partnerships, in particular tripartite cooperation among the United Nations, the African Union and the European Union. It was under Portuguese leadership that relations between the European Union and Africa were institutionalized at the highest level, and during its presidency of the European Union in 2021, Portugal will strive to further deepen the partnership between Europe and Africa. The role of the European Union as a global player, open to the world, a defender of multilateralism and economic exchanges that are beneficial to all will be a priority of our EU presidency.\nSeveral organizations, of diverse nature, make positive contributions to the international rules-based order and demonstrate the willingness to cooperate. Among them, I would like to highlight, of course, the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, which brings together nations from four continents. Under the current presidency of Cabo Verde and the subsequent presidency of Angola, the CPLP attests to the ability to establish partnerships and build bridges between countries and peoples, united because they share a language whose World Day \u2014on 5 May \u2014 was declared by UNESCO. In this regard, I welcome the resolution of the post-electoral stalemate in Guinea-Bissau and hope that it will usher in a new cycle of stability and prosperity for the country. Furthermore, I express my deep solidarity with Mozambique \u2014 a victim of terrorist attacks and attempts to destabilize its northern regions.\nMr. President,\nSecretary-General,\nPortugal is a country that is open to the world. It advocates dialogue and a fair system of rules, in a stable and predictable environment. We know where the path of autocracy, aggressive nationalism and survival of the fittest has led us in the past. Seventy-five years ago, the founders of the United Nations had the courage to lay the foundations for a new world order, based on international law, equality among sovereign States and the dignity of the human person. It was the victory of hope. Today we cannot succumb to cynicism. It is our duty to cherish and build on the gains we achieved together to ensure a better future. A strong United Nations is essential for the good of us all.\nThank you very much."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nExcellencies,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nThis year is different, and so is this session. The 75th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations is an opportunity for world leaders to talk about the future. But, before I do that, allow me to look back.\n75 years ago, the tragedies of the Second World War led to creating a new global system based on the UN Charter. The UN as such, the only truly universal international organisation, stands as the pillar of the post-war international order. I am very proud that Czechoslovakia, and subsequently the Czech Republic of today, was among its fifty original founders. Moreover, it was a Czechoslovak diplomat, Mr Jan Papanek, who was in the group of 14 experts that finalized the text of the UN Charter. Respecting the UN Charter by all States is a prerequisite of a rules based international system, which is crucial for our peaceful coexistence on the planet.\nThe world has changed since 1945. Today we are facing an extraordinary pandemic situation, which has become a stress-test for our ability to cooperate in a coordinated, multilateral manner. It is exactly at times of such challenges that we need to be able to reach a high degree of mutual understanding. We should not pretend that everything works perfectly. There are systemic limitations and weaknesses to our global system. It is clear that a substantial reform is necessary. That is why I see the current health crisis as an opportunity \u2014 an opportunity to put forward ambitious reforms that will allow us to \u201cbuild back better\u201d. The Czech Republic remains a strong supporter of the UN Secretary-General in his reforms towards a more effective, transparent and responsible UN.\nWe are in favour of an open discussion on a revision of the multilateral health architecture. This revision needs to be based on a fair and objective evaluation of the international response to the pandemic. Unfortunately, and I say it with regret, the response we have seen by the World Health Organization has failed to exercise global health leadership. It did not act resolutely after the pandemic outbreak in\nWuhan, China, and had a very limited success \u2014 to put it softly \u2014 in helping countries prevent, protect against, and respond to disease events. The WHO has failed even in the fields it is usually praised for \u2014 in the application of its epidemiological expertise and medical know-how in order to help governments tackle virus outbreaks. Confusing recommendations by the WHO regarding wearing facemask is only one example of its questionable role during the past months.\nTo put it shortly, we have been again reminded of the necessity of a reform of international mechanisms to fight pandemic situations. It will not be an easy task and it deserves a lot of attention from experts as well as us, top politicians. But I declare that the Czech Republic supports such a reform and will actively contribute to it.\nLet me mention one example of a concrete need for a better-coordinated action: We are witnessing a proliferation of initiatives regarding access to the COVID-19 vaccine. We call for a coordinating role of the UN in this matter in order to ensure that these initiatives are complementary, not clashing with one another. History shows that crises and competition are engines of progress. I agree. I myself was a successful businessman and I understand business opportunities. But sometimes business considerations are not the most important. There are times when all stakeholders must conduct research and development especially carefully and responsibly.\nResearch and innovation are of great importance and not only in the context of the search for a vaccine and medical treatment of COVID-19. This pandemic, which so badly needs efficient crisis management both at national and international level, shows us how essential it is to increase our investment in scientific research, technology development and innovation to prepare better for addressing future crises faster and much more efficiently. Equally important is multilateral cooperation in data sharing and in mobility of researchers.\nThe Czech Republic has contributed to the global effort to fight the virus in a coordinated way. Just one example: Czech researchers have focused on application of nanotechnology in constructing facemasks. The technology, developed in the Czech Republic, has been used in other parts of the world. And of course Czech scientists have been actively collaborating with their colleagues from abroad (from Israel, Germany or the U.S.) not only in the nanotechnology field.\nBut as we are in the global arena, let me revert to more universal issues. The pandemic has accelerated three major global trends that undermine effective multilateralism: 1) global geopolitical confrontation, 2) increasing political and economic fragmentation, 3) a clash between personal freedoms and technological surveillance, including the tendency for a faster introduction of artificial intelligence into the health sector.\nThe COVID-19 crisis is not only a huge health crisis, but has profound economic consequences. The Czech Republic has an extremely open, globally highly integrated economy and as such we have always been in favour of a strong, rules based international trade system. The capacity and ability of global economic institutions will be further tested to address large-scale economic problems. However, one thing is clear \u2014 we need a stronger and more effective WTO with updated rules and their enforcement. Achieving a credible reform of the WTO will require engagement of all member states and political capital investment by world leaders. The Czech Republic, mainly through the EU, will make every effort to enforce the existing international trade rules in the shadow of rising global trade tensions and protectionist measures. Our ambition is as open international trade as possible.\nAs mentioned before, in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic and its socioeconomic implications, Europe will have to redefine its role in the world. The political decisions the EU is now making to deal with the crisis will shape the future of the European project and the role of the EU as a global player in the coming years. However, as we have already heard today, every crisis is an opportunity. Within the EU we have agreed on the unprecedented European Recovery Plan that should help EU member states in facing the current crisis, which is economically comparable to the one in the 1930s. Just like 90 years ago, the best way out of a crisis is to invest through it. We have to use vast amounts of money to make Europe more sustainable and innovative. If we want to succeed on a global scale, Europe has to establish itself as a tech industry leader, which is a very difficult task in the face of the current competition, especially from the US and Chinese companies. Nevertheless, where there is a will there is a way. Europe has shown it can be a global leader in many specific areas like in tackling climate change.\nThe global pandemic has overshadowed many global issues that have not disappeared. Europe will eventually have to deal with illegal migration, Brexit or extensive foreign and security challenges. The European continent as such has to accept more responsibility, particularly in the area of its defense policy, in order to become a more strategically autonomous security player capable of taking a more independent action, especially in its own neighborhood. We need decision-making structures that can act swiftly in crisis and the necessary civilian and operational capabilities to carry out these decisions.\nBut our healthy future is not only about the economy or crisis management. It is also about information. The Czech Republic, like many other countries not merely in Europe, has had its own unfortunate experience with cyber-attacks against our hospitals. These acts simply make the effects of the pandemic worse. We call on all countries to work together through the UN to protect hospitals and other critical civilian infrastructure from future cyber-attacks. There is no better time than now to show that the international community will not tolerate aggressive cyber behaviour and that it is ready to work in a coordinated manner to become more resilient.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has truly shaken our world. Unfortunately, it is not the only global political problem of today. Wars and fighting are going on. The Czech Republic, together with a majority of Member States, has endorsed the Secretary General\u2019s call for a global ceasefire. This is the time for peace. Promotion of international peace, rule of law and peaceful settlement of disputes are our key foreign policy objectives. Effective conflict prevention and mediation are the essential tools.\nWe are concerned about the instability in the Sahel region. The international community must continue its joint effort to assist this region. Our main goal is to empower our local partners. The Czech Republic is an active member of the Small Group in the Global Coalition against Daesh and also in the emerging Coalition for the Sahel. Our security activities focus on the EU Training Mission in Mali where we have the second largest contingent. We have also established a new national programme with a total budget of \u20ac12 million to address root causes of migration in African countries of origin and transit, as well as to support socio-economic development of this region.\nThe Czech Republic has an extensive and long-term engagement in stabilization assistance to unsteady areas of the Middle East. Currently, we participate, for example, in training missions in Iraq, providing assistance to refugees in the region and their host countries (approximately $6 million in 2020), and most recently we provided humanitarian assistance to Lebanon following the explosion in the port of Beirut.\nWe therefore welcome the recent agreement to normalize bilateral relations between the State of Israel and the United Arab Emirates. We hope this historic diplomatic achievement will enhance peace and stability in the Middle East. The Czech Republic wishes for more realism to be introduced into the way this issue is perceived within the UN.\nLet me mention one more topic of concern \u2014 Belarus. I strongly believe that every society should be able to decide on its future by free and democratic elections. Independent media and civil society are crucial as they provide real-time information, document election frauds and brutality of security forces. An intra-Belarusian dialogue is the only way of resolving the crisis. Its logical outcome should be new elections.\nThe Czech Republic has its own experience with political transformation and democratization. We are sincerely proud of what we have managed to achieve not only in the context of the current crisis, but also, and in the first place, of the way we have become a prosperous, safe and innovative society in the thirty years since the Velvet Revolution.\nNow we belong to the democratic world, we are responsible members of NATO, the EU, and other international organizations. In every respect, we are a successful country.\nWe have witnessed some very encouraging success stories even in fighting against the most recent invisible enemy we all need to fight. From the outset, the government of the Czech Republic had the ambition to help our businesses in their struggles while taking swift measures to advise our citizens on how to protect themselves and to repatriate home those stranded abroad. Based on a number of deaths due to COVID-19 per 1 million people we belong to the top countries in Europe. We have not won yet.\nNone of our countries has defeated the virus. The development is rather dynamic and the number of new cases rises every day. The upcoming months will be very hard.\nNevertheless, I am sure we will overcome the COVID-19 pandemic, just like we will overcome other global issues we are facing today. We, the Czech Republic, are ready to work with all of you, the UN Member States, making our world safer, cleaner and more prosperous.\nThank you for your attention and I wish you good health, endless energy and positive motivation for our joint effort."

        "file_text": "Mr. President of the General Assembly,\nLadies and Gentlemen, Heads of State and Government and Heads of Delegation,\nMr. Secretary-General of the United Nations,\nAt the start of my remarks, on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Macky SALL, President of the Senegalese Republic and People, I would like to extend my warm congratulations to the Republic of Turkey, for the decision to elect Ambassador Volkan BOZKIR to lead the work of the 75th Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.\nHe has Senegal\u2019s support and cooperation and I wish him every success in his august duties in the service of the Member States.\nI also thank his predecessor, Professor Tijjani MUHAMMAD-BANDE, for his outstanding work in a most difficult context, marked by an unprecedented health crisis of Covid-19.\nTo the Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, I reiterate Senegal\u2019s support for his continued efforts to reform the United Nations system, as the bedrock of more inclusive multilateralism.\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nAlthough we had planned to mark the seventy-fifth anniversary of the UN in grandiose fashion, we find ourselves in a virtual environment, physically separated from one another because of the pandemic.\nTo paraphrase President Macky Sail, the infinitesimally small got the better of us. It is an unprecedented even in the Organization\u2019s 75-year existence!\nAccordingly, the theme chosen, entitled \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism \u2014 confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action\u201d, could not be more timely, as it calls on us to take a clearer look at our shared challenges.\nEven more so than a progress report, the commemoration of the anniversary provides a meaningful opportunity to critically examine the Organization\u2019s 75-year history, including its achievements, as well as its limitations, which hinder achieving current objectives.\nWith that in mind, I will address three major topics. First, I will speak about the imperative of finding a collective and united response to the global health emergency brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSecondly, given the uncertainty of the situation, I will discuss the need for the United Nations, whose mission is universal, to remain focused on its major priorities through its three main pillars of peace and security, sustainable development \u2014 in particular the climate emergency \u2014 and the promotion and protection of human rights.\nLastly, I am going to share some lessons learned from Senegal\u2019s experience as a developing country, particularly in the context of its pandemic response strategy.\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nThe year 2020 will undoubtedly be remembered as a dark time, indelibly marked by the pandemic, whose devastating effects on every aspect of our lives have demonstrated \u2014 as if there were any need by now to demonstrate \u2014 our collective vulnerability.\nAt this time, I pay tribute to the memory of the hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 victims and wish the millions of patients sick with the disease a speedy recovery.\nLet us commend all actors who have taken up against this collective threat, in particular the health-care personnel, to whom I express my admiration and firm support.\nTo the international organizations, in particular the World Health Organization, which is responsible for coordinating the global response to this threat, I reiterate Senegal\u2019s support.\nAccordingly, my delegation calls for the effective implementation of the resolution adopted by consensus by the seventy-third World Health Assembly, particularly with a view to ensuring rapid, affordable, safe and quality access to essential health-care services and technologies, such as diagnostic tests, medicines and vaccines.\nWe firmly believe that any potential vaccine or treatment developed in the fight against COVID-19 should be considered a global public good and made available to all countries.\nIn addition, we must work together to ensure the availability of and access to essential health-care services, in particular quality primary care, which is key to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, especially Sustainable Development Goal 3.\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nThe devastating impact of the crisis on our economies is indisputable! The collapse of economic growth and consequent dearth of sources of foreign exchange and shock to commodity prices, well as the decline in exports, investments and migrant remittances, have put the world economy in an crisis situation the likes of which have not been seen since the 1930s.\nAlthough it had initiated sustained growth dynamics, Africa, like the rest of the world, is suffering the full impact of the far-reaching crisis.\nTherefore, in order to ensure a proper recovery of our economies and ensure global sociopolitical stability, we will need to further focus on international solidarity and cooperation.\nThat is why His Excellency Mr. Macky Sail has called for the cancellation of public debt and the restructuring of private debt, as well as on developed countries to honour their commitments to official development assistance.\nI would like to take this opportunity to commend the efforts made by the members of the G-20, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in support of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative.\nWhat Africa truly requires is not a debt moratorium, but rather debt cancellation in order to foster economic and social resilience, as well as build effective health-care systems.\nIn that regard, the Secretary-General\u2019s call for a large-scale multilateral response to marshal financial resources of at least 10 per cent of the world\u2019s GDP deserves our full support, as it shows us the way to effectively address global challenges.\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nDuring its 75-years existence, the United Nations \u2014 the quintessential symbol of multilateralism \u2014 has made great strides in promoting international peace and security, mutual understanding among peoples, sustainable development and respect for human dignity.\nThis is evidenced by the many peace operations throughout the world, decolonization and the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, as well as the support and assistance that the UN provides to all people in need in the world, regardless of their origins or background.\nUndeniably, the Organization has contributed greatly to the realization of our shared goal of bringing about a world free from the scourge of war, poverty and exclusion.\nWe stand in need today of reinvigorated multilateralism and a reformed and effective universal Organization, as collective answers to our existential questions, so that no one is left behind.\nTogether, we can face the multiple challenges of terrorism, violent extremism, armed conflict, financing for development, illicit financial flows, migration, poverty, exclusion, public health and climate change.\nIn that regard, it is legitimate to ask why Africa remains the only continent that does not have a permanent seat on the Security Council, which devotes a large part of its agenda to the continent?\nBy hosting the ministerial meeting of the African Union Committee of Ten Heads of State and Government, entrusted with representing Africa\u2019s voice on the reform of the Security Council, Senegal reaffirmed its commitment to the issue which, more than a moral imperative, is a way to revive the founding spirit of the Charter and its ideals.\nAdmittedly, Africa continues to face political and security challenges, which hinder sustainable development efforts.\nIn the Sahel, for example, terrorism and violent extremism have found fertile ground, with their resultant death toll, destruction of infrastructure and looting, thereby maintaining an environment of fear. All of that is against the backdrop of political and institutional instability, poverty, exclusion, porous borders and illiteracy, among others.\nThat state of affairs, however, should not obscure the other Africa, which is entrepreneurial, innovates, invents, succeeds and is admirably dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic in the face of the most alarmist forecasts.\nThe youth of the continent \u2014 60 per cent of the population is under 24 years of age \u2014 and its immense natural resources and vitality all represent tremendous potential in terms of economic and social transformation. The time has therefore come to seriously look at Africa in this light.\nAs President Macky Sail recently recalled\n\u201cFor a world economy that is running out of steam, building Africa represents\na source of opportunities and investments\u201d.\nTherefore, the decade of action to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals, which we have just launched, is a fresh opportunity for us to work towards a revitalized post-COVID-19 recovery and the full implementation of 2030 Agenda.\nFurthermore, in implementing the Declaration on the commemoration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, which Senegal fully endorses, we must renew our commitment to the agenda for UN reform in order to restore multilateralism to its rightful place with the United Nations at its centre.\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nThe determination with which we are combating the COVID-19 pandemic must also inspire us to fight effectively against climate change and safeguard biodiversity.\nIndeed, there is no need to recall that climate change is having a devastating effect on populations, particularly in that it increases poverty, rural exodus, social exclusion and intercommunal tensions over natural resources.\nFor example, like several countries in the Sahel region, Senegal recently recorded the equivalent of a month\u2019s amount of rain in one day, which upended the lives of thousands of people.\nIf we want to avoid the apocalypse for future generations, we have no alternative but to implement the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. In particular, developed countries must honour their financial commitments, including the Green Climate Fund.\nEqually of concern is the challenge concerning the loss of biodiversity. As His Excellency Mr. Macky Sail noted,\n\u201cThe loss of biodiversity is a global emergency that is of concern to all of us\n[as part of the same ecosystem]\u201d.\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nIn order to address the COVID-19 pandemic, Senegal has launched the Economic and Social Resiliency Programme with funding in the amount of 1,000 billion CFA francs, or $1.6 billion.\nSupported through the financing of partners and donors, the Programme has made it possible to meet emergency and material health-care needs, assist households and the diaspora population, support the private sector, including through tax incentives, and ensure an adequate supply of fuel.\nThe Programme, which incorporates the SDGs, prioritizes health and pharmaceutical sovereignty, the resilience of populations and macroeconomic and financial stability.\nWithin that framework, on the instructions of the Head of State, the Government has launched a 500 billion CFA franc investment plan for the period from 2020 to 2024 to ensure the health-care system\u2019s resiliency and sustainability.\nAs a result of those efforts, Senegal was ranked second in the Global Response Index with regard to its response to the pandemic.\nIn that regard, the 2019-2023 Adjusted and Accelerated Priority Action Plan of the Plan for an Emerging Senegal Plan has been revised upwards from $4,098 to $14,712 billion, contributing to a sum of more than $26 billion in total investments.\nThe crucial issue of climate change has been prioritized within that framework, particularly through the implementation of the Green Emerging Senegal Plan.\nIn that regard, an investment programme is dedicating 50 billion CFA francs, or approximately $90 million, to the sustainable reforestation of the national territory, the establishment of a national forest research institute and the Senegalese Forest Protection Agency in order to strengthen current policies in that area.\nConcerning foreign policy, in remaining faithful to its principles under the leadership of its Head of State, Senegal continues to advocate good neighbourliness, regional integration, the promotion of peace and human rights, and international cooperation and solidarity.\nAccordingly, I renew my country\u2019s continued commitment to a definitive return to peace and stability in Mali.\nThat is the entire motivation behind the efforts of His Excellency President Macky Sail, particularly within the framework of ECOWAS, with a view to supporting Malian stakeholders to come together in the best interests of Mali for the benefit of Malians and our entire subregion.\nSenegal is pursuing those efforts within MINUSMA \u2014 a valuable contribution illustrating my country\u2019s commitment to peacekeeping, with a view to promoting peace, security and stability throughout the world.\nIt is that same faith in human solidarity and justice that is driving Senegal in its role as Chair of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People.\nIn that regard, we urge the international community to step up efforts to realize the right of the Palestinian people to an independent and viable State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, coexisting in peace and security with the State of Israel, with both living within secure and internationally recognized borders.\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nI would be remiss if I failed to mention that the future we want continues to depend on lessons learned, particularly those relating to the health crisis. Despite our resilience, the pandemic has called into question doing business as usual, forcing us to break with past practices.\nAs we are all in the same boat facing the same vulnerabilities, Senegal is convinced that there is no alternative to working collectively and in solidarity.\nTherefore, the sustainable development that we aspire to for ourselves and future generations must be centred on our shared humanity in harmony with the laws of nature.\nThat is what underpins the new world order advocated by President Macky Sail. It is an order based on justice, the rule of law and fair and equitable governance in full cooperation, solidarity and mutual respect \u2014 that is to say inclusive multilateralism, which will be quintessential^ embodied by a reformed and effective United Nations.\nI thank you for your kind attention."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nHeads of State and Government,\nSecretary-General,\nDistinguished Delegates,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nLet me on behalf of the Government and good people of Nigeria, congratulate you on your well-deserved election as President of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). I would like to assure you of Nigeria\u2019s readiness to avail the United Nations all necessary cooperation needed for the fulfillment of your mandate.\nI wish to also thank the General Assembly for the support accorded His Excellency, Tijjani Muhammad-Bande during his tenure as President of the 74th Session of the General Assembly.\nWe acknowledge the accomplishments of the Assembly under his able leadership, particularly his efforts on attacking global poverty through the Global Coalition on Poverty Eradication.\nWe also commend the tremendous efforts of His Excellency, Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, in steering the affairs of the organization during this challenging period of the Coronavirus pandemic, as well as his strong commitment to making the UN more efficient and responsive in its international responsibility.\nYour Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates,\nIt is my privilege to use this opportunity to congratulate Member States on the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations. Over the past seven decades, the United Nations, as the People\u2019s Assembly, has helped to stabilize the global community.\nIn addition to international peace and security, the UN has undertaken programmes on poverty eradication, women\u2019s empowerment, youth development and humanitarian emergencies.\nThe theme of this year\u2019s General Assembly \u2014 \u201cThe Future We Want, The United Nations We Need: Reaffirming Our Collective Commitment To Multilateralism \u2014 Confronting Coronavirus Through Effective Multilateral Action\u201d, is indeed most appropriate and timely, as it captures our common desire for a renewed and revitalized organization in need of multilateral approaches to the many challenges facing the world.\nTHE FUTURE WE WANT\nAs we reflect on the future we want and the United Nations we need, we must realize that the peoples of the world not only look up to us: they count on us. If the United Nations system cannot mobilize the world to marshal out a truly effective and inclusive response to the Coronavirus pandemic, then the United Nations would have failed in its core mission of giving expression, direction and solution to the yearnings of the international community.\nExcellencies,\nThe future we want must guarantee human rights, human dignity, human prospects and prosperity. The principles of \u201cLeaving No One Behind and Doing No Harm\u201d must be expressed through accountability, strategic growth initiatives and elimination of threats of all kinds.\nIn our quest to provide a future of hope and prosperity for Nigerians, our administration has embarked on measures to ensure enhanced national resilience. We intend to achieve this through the implementation of the Economic Sustainability Plan and the Medium Term National Development Plans for the period 2020-2025 and 2026-2030. We expect that these ambitious initiatives will deliver sustainable economic growth and development to Nigeria.\nTHE UNITED NATIONS WE NEED\nPredicated on the values that inspired its creation, the United Nations we need has to remain an agent of progress, by giving expression to the tenets of multilateralism, solidarity and international cooperation. It is within the context of this rules-based multilateral order that the world can find solutions to its many problems.\nCONFRONTING COVID-19 THROUGH EFFECTIVE MULTILATERAL ACTIONS\nThe world is currently in the grips of the coronavirus pandemic. Regrettably, our communities and countries are losing lives. The coronavirus pandemic has devastated the world economy and strained the capabilities of the health system of many countries, including our own country.\nIn the aftermath of coronavirus outbreak in Nigeria, we prioritized vulnerable groups, including women, children, older persons and the unemployed, in our efforts to provide medical and social assistance to cushion the socioeconomic effects of the disease.\nAccordingly, we have expanded our National Social Register, to include an additional 1 million Nigerians. Our National Social Investment Programme (NSIP) has been the vehicle for reaching out to the poor and vulnerable members of the Nigerian population, as well as providing cover for over 22 million households.\nI use this opportunity to commend the efforts of the United Nations and the World Health Organization in combating the Coronavirus pandemic.\nI note, with appreciation, the $2-billion Global Humanitarian Response Plan launched by the UN Secretary-General to fund the Coronavirus response in the poorest countries of the world.\nI also commend his call for ceasefire in conflict areas, to enable humanitarian assistance reach groups vulnerable to coronavirus .\nExcellencies,\nI should also state that Nigeria is committed to working with other Member States in the spirit of global cooperation and solidarity to promote human health and general well-being. Nigeria will continue to partner with the WHO and some countries to ensure accelerated development and manufacturing, as well as uninhibited supply of safe and effective coronavirus vaccines to all.\nPOVERTY ERADICATION\nIn order to mitigate its impact on Nigerians, our administration has commenced the disbursement of the sum of N10.9 Billion to households and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises as palliatives.\nIn addition, we have established a five hundred billion (N500 billion) fiscal stimulus package and sustained delivery of humanitarian and social interventions to poor and vulnerable households, while our Central Bank has launched a N3.5 trillion-stimulus package to boost manufacturing and facilitate import substitution.\nThe international community will need to cooperate in addressing the scourge of poverty, particularly in developing countries. It is in this regard, that we commend the President of the 74th General Assembly for launching an Alliance for Poverty Eradication in June.\nWe encourage global leaders, particularly leaders from the global North, to support the Alliance at this time when the COVID-19 pandemic is reversing gains made in the achievement of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals and is pushing an additional half a billion people into extreme poverty.\nSUSTAINABLE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT\nMr. President,\nAs we mark the beginning of the UN Decade of Action for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, Nigeria has made significant strides in domesticating the SDGs.\nThere is an ongoing re-alignment of the National Statistical System (NSS) with the requirements and indicators of the SDGs. This is expected to ensure effective tracking and monitoring of the SDGs and guide SDG interventions across the country.\nNigeria has also developed its home-grown Integrated Sustainable Development Goals model (iSDG Model) \u2014 an analytical framework for assessing how policymaking can better address the indivisible nature of the SDGs.\nDISARMAMENT, INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY\nExcellencies,\nNigeria remains deeply concerned over the illicit trade, transfer, and circulation of small arms and light weapons, particularly on the continent of Africa.\nWe urge the international community to renew efforts to stem this traffic and promote the Arms Trade Treaty in order to codify accountability in the ongoing battle against trans-border crimes, including terrorism and acts of piracy.\nTERRORISM/COUNTER-TERRORISM\nExcellencies,\nThe litany of sophisticated terrorist attacks across the globe is a harsh reality of the challenges the world is facing today. We must therefore redouble our efforts to ensure collective security.\nIn Nigeria, we are still facing violent extremism from the insurgency of Boko Haram and bandits. We continue to count on our strong cooperation with UN Counter- Terrorism bodies and neighbouring countries to overcome the terrorists in the Lake Chad Basin and the wider Sahel Region.\nWe will vigorously sustain the rehabilitation, reconstruction and resettlement of victims of terrorism and insurgency in the North-East. The North-East Development Commission has been established for that purpose.\nNUCLEAR DISARMAMENT\nMr. President,\nNigeria is commited to universal nuclear non-proliferation. In this connection, we recall the adoption of the landmark Treaty on The Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which opened for signature on 20 September 2017. Nigeria participated actively in the processes leading to its adoption and was an early signatory and ratifier.\nWith less than ten ratifications needed for the TPNW\u2019s entry into force, we urge other member states who have not done so to quickly ratify the Treaty for the actualization of its important objective.\nCLIMATE CHANGE\nExcellencies,\nClimate Change is an environmental crisis which requires urgent action. Our Administration is conscious of the fact that the attainment of national development targets would be greatly impeded unless the consequences of climate change are addressed holistically in line with the Paris Agreement.\nTo this end, Nigeria has intensified climate action through the upward review of reduction in greenhouse gas emission under the Nationally Determined Contributions, which are climate change targets under the Paris Agreement.\nNigeria remains steadfast in our commitment to the revitalization of Lake Chad. We are convinced that recharging the Lake will improve the living conditions of our people in the area, promote inter-state cooperation, strengthen community resilience, and assist in addressing environmental and security challenges threatening the region and its resources.\nLet me, therefore, reiterate the call for international support for the sub-regional efforts to raise the $50 billion required to actualize this initiative.\nMIGRATION\nExcellencies,\nNigeria experiences high internal and external migration due to the size of its population, economic situation and climate. We are therefore fully committed to migration management and prevention of irregular migration and human trafficking.\nI enjoin the international community to also communicate the positive contributions of migrants, particularly in countries of destination, in order to combat racial discrimination and xenophobic attacks, and facilitate the social integration and protection of migrants.\nILLICIT FINANCIAL FLOWS\nMr. President,\nThe global aspiration to recover from the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic will not be fully met without addressing existing structures that make it more difficult for countries to generate and retain their financial resources.\nIt is in this regard that I thank the immediate past Presidents of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council, Ambassador Tijjani Muhammad- Bande and Ambassador Mona Jul, respectively, for jointly launching the High-Level Panel on International Financial Accountability, Transparency and Integrity for Achieving the 2030 Agenda.\nHUMAN RIGHTS\nMr. President,\nIn the area of human rights, Nigeria has passed a number of human rights- related bills into law. The bills include: the Anti-Torture Act, the Comprehensive Treatment and Care for Victims of Gun-Shot Act, as well as the National Senior Citizens Centre Act. In addition, Nigeria has launched a National Action Plan for Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism.\nThis measure is designed to strengthen institutions, coordinate the prevention of violent extremism, enhance the rule of law, access to justice and human rights as well as engaging communities and building resilience and integrated strategic communication.\nWOMEN EMPOWERMENT/GENDER PARITY\nMr. President,\nThe United Nations has made progress in advancing gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment through initiatives such as the Beijing Declaration and Programme of Action and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. The creation of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), in July 2010, was an important milestone.\nNigeria acknowledges the importance of gender equality and recognizes the critical role that women play in development. We also recognize that the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and other International-Agreed Development Agenda depend largely on the empowerment of women. Nigeria will sustain its affirmative stance through women empowerment initiatives.\nQUALITY EDUCATION\nMr. President,\nQuality education for all is the cornerstone of sustainable development.\nIn this connection, I am happy to announce that the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria will be hosting the 4th International Conference on Safe Schools in 2021.\nI invite You all to Nigeria to participate in the Conference which aims to advocate for the protection of education from attack as we work together towards the future we want.\nUNITED NATIONS REFORM Mr. President,\nAs we urge and strive for inclusion within our societies, we must also ensure inclusion prevails in our collective action as members of the International Community. Nigeria supports the expansion of the UN Security Council to reflect the diversity and dynamics of the 21st Century. Africa deserves permanent seats in the United Nations Security Council.\nCONCLUSION\nMr. President\nI will conclude by reaffirming Nigeria\u2019s commitment to promoting international peace and security and sustainable development, as well as strengthening partnerships and cooperation with international and regional organisations.\nI thank you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President of the General Assembly,\nMr. Secretary-General,\nHeads and Members of Delegations,\nExcellencies, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen,\nLet me begin by congratulating His Excellency Mr. Volkan Bozkir on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-fifth session. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande for his leadership of the seventy-fourth session and salute Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his continued efforts in promoting peace, security and development during these challenging times.\nMr. President,\nThe General Assembly at its seventy-fifth session is being convened at a time when the global community has been galvanized in pursuit of impartiality, respect and justice for all in the face of a pandemic that presents global economic uncertainties unlike any we have witnessed in recent history.\nDistinguished Delegates,\nMoments like these, as difficult and challenging as they appear, also provide us with an opportunity to temper a culture that must now find new meaning through the reconnection to all ideals. Indeed, we must pursue an economic construct that responds to community and conscience. The United Nations must ensure that the appropriate response addresses the inconsistencies of every nation at all levels and must not be seen to favour the more developed and powerful. This response must not only make for a greener planet and cleaner oceans, but must also provide hope for growing diverse generations that stand to congregate at all levels across the globe to dialogue on issues of mutual importance in the interest of this generation and future ones.\nHistory will record the seventy-fifth session as a historic one. The impact of COVID-19 continues to redefine our very existence and test our resilience. It has reshaped how organizations, such as this united body, continues to function and how all countries do business. The reality is that small island developing States like Dominica already face several inherent challenges, and the added consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have further exacerbated those difficulties, including the limitation to protect the health and well-being of our citizens.\nMr. President, Fellow Delegates,\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica recorded its first case of the dreaded COVID-19 virus on 20 March, and we have been fortunate so far to have only 30 confirmed cases of which only six are currently active, with no recorded deaths.\nMr. President,\nWhen Dominica recorded its first active case of COVID-19, the Government immediately imposed responsible measures in accordance with World Health Organization standards and protocols. Our Government adopted a series of containment measures, which included the enforcement of curfew hours and the closure of all ports of entry, educational institutions, non-essential businesses and public services for a period of three months. As a result of those actions, with the support of every citizen, we united in a collective fight against the pandemic, which resulted in the Commonwealth of Dominica being ranked very highly among countries that have remained steadfast in their goals of reducing and eliminating all active cases of the pandemic over the past eight months. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, health-care experts have now informed us that we must ready our populations for a second wave. It is therefore the sober, moral and ethical duty of us leaders, who appreciate the work of the experts, to serve notice to our citizens.\nMr. President,\nFor small States like ours, the potential second wave has drastically raised the stakes, and if we do not rise to the occasion, we could lose an entire generation.\nMr. President,\nAt every level of our response to COVID-19, we have respected the fundamental rights and freedoms of all of our citizens. The Government remains committed to ensuring that all citizens who have been infected are properly treated and cared for, while, at the same time, continuing to provide our regular services to all citizens. Students have returned to their schools, and businesses are operating once again in their new number. The crisis has however resulted in job losses for many of our citizens, particularly those working in our tourism industry. That threatens to undermine the development gains that we have made and plunge many of our citizens into poverty.\nDistinguished Delegates,\nIn our role as leaders of our respective Governments, the task is always to provide guidance and hope to our populations. That is a greater challenge for small States like Dominica that must simultaneously battle the effects of climate change, the recent shocks and our inability to access concessionary financing to build the resilience needed to counter the natural and economic shocks that are way beyond our control.\nMr. President, Fellow Delegates,\nThe Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica will continue to use platforms, such as the General Assembly high-level debate, to highlight the inequality and inadequacy that continue to permeate our generation, and, to that end, we will call on the United Nations to assist small States like ours in unlocking funds that have been made available to small island developing States to fight climate change and be resilient.\nFellow Delegates,\nDespite our many challenges, we have not sat idly by. As a response to the complete devastation of our island by Hurricane Maria in 2017, we developed a national resilience development strategy. The strategy has since been translated into a climate resilience recovery plan, which will guide us on our journey towards becoming a climate resilient nation. It is an ambitious, but very achievable, plan. And we are confident that, with the support of our development partners, it can serve as a pathway for other small island developing States, which share similar challenges and experiences, to ensure their continued survival.\nFellow Delegates,\nThe situation is dire. The situation is urgent. We welcome any support that could influence the provision of adequate financial support in a timely and equitable manner.\nMr. President,\nWith regard to financial matters, I would also like to assert before this body that small economies like ours run the risk of being crippled if banking restrictions and inequalities are allowed to continue in their existing form. In that regard, the support of the international community in the achievement of fiscal and financial resilience is paramount. It is therefore in the interest of all of our nations to explore more adaptable solutions to de-risking, which would involve broadening the revenue base of States.\nDistinguished Delegates,\nDominica extend its congratulations to the Republic of Cuba on the nomination of the Henry Reeve international contingent of doctors specializing in major diseases and epidemics for the Nobel Peace Prize. That is a fitting recognition of the sterling work that Cuba has done in providing support throughout the world to countries confronting pandemics and natural disasters. The Cuban medical Brigade has been an example of health diplomacy, genuine internationalism and the true embodiment of the term, \u201cbeing our brother\u2019s keeper\u201d. We sincerely hope that the world is taking note. We salute Cuba for its humanitarian assistance to more than 40 countries, including Dominica, which has received an immeasurable benefit from the supportive work of Cuban doctors, nurses and health-care professionals, particularly during this critical period of addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn the light of that, we reiterate our call to end the 60-year-long unfair and unjustifiable blockade against the Cuban Government and people. Despite being substantially disadvantaged by the blockade, Cuba continues to reach out to support others. If this crisis has shown us nothing else, it has shown us how vulnerable we all are and that our life as we know it can change in an instant. We therefore call and will continue to call for a change of policy on the matter.\nThe Government of Dominica also salutes the Government and the people of the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Government and the people of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela who, notwithstanding their own challenges, have both made significant contributions to the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in the Caribbean region. We also express our sincere gratitude to the The Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA), the Pan American Health Organization and the World Health Organization for their exceptional guidance throughout the pandemic.\nTo our global partners and supporting agencies that continue to assess our vulnerable Caribbean region during these challenging times we say, \u201cThank you\u201d.\nLike every other small island developing State, The Commonwealth of Dominica remains hopeful that its population size and small economy will not place it at a disadvantage with regard to accessing COVID-19 vaccines and other medications in the coming months, but that small States like Dominica will be allowed fair and equitable access to global supplies.\nMr. President,\nDominica remains committed to collaborating with the United Nations and all its agencies, as well as Member States, to strengthen the mission of this noble body that, notwithstanding its imperfections, is critical to maintaining world peace and security. We affirm our confidence in the United Nations system as the ultimate negotiating and deliberative body for addressing major challenges confronting the world. Our populations far and wide are being impacted by every decision that we make, and they are depending on us to do the right thing. Notwithstanding our many challenges, limitations and differences, we owe it to them to rise to the occasion.\nI thank you."

I wish the General Assembly every success in its current session.\nThis is the first time in the history of the United Nations that the General Assembly is meeting virtually. It is a consequence of the current COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 a cross-border threat that threatens our life and means of life, as well as our economies and communities in general. This virtual meeting is a real symbol of the radical changes in our way of life and how we communicate.\nWe are amid a historic paradox as we meet and communicate at a time when we are called upon to socially distance. We are hindered by the pandemic but our persistence to live makes us work hard to face it. The pandemic in any city or village on the globe is a continued threat to the entire world. It compels us to work in solidarity and cooperation among States and communities regardless of our differences. That will enable us to eradicate the pandemic or, at least, to curb its effects.\nThis pandemic also behoves the developed nations to cooperate by sharing experiences and information in order to combat it. Developed nations must help developing nations in order to create a healthy environment that will allow them to combat the pandemic and limit its harmful effects on our communities and our lives.\nMoreover, we are all responsible for combating misinformation about the pandemic. Indeed, ignorance and misinformation jeopardize the lives of millions. Early planning plays a crucial role in guaranteeing equity in the distribution of a vaccine when it becomes available. We will need to prevent its market distribution from becoming a purely commercial act in order to allow the poorest countries to have access to the vaccine for all their citizens.\nGiven our limited resources owing to the circumstances in which we find ourselves, Iraq is combating the pandemic and trying to curb its effects with a series of measures and precautions. Despite these efforts, we still have much more to do, notwithstanding our limited capabilities and weak infrastructure, in the realm of medical care and medical services.\nBefore and after the emergence of the pandemic, Iraq faced another scourge that is no less dangerous \u2014 that of terrorism and corruption. We succeeded in vanquishing military terrorism, while liberating our cities with strong will power and sacrifices made by our army forces, the popular crowd and the Peshmerga, with the support of the international coalition and our neighbours.\nNevertheless, the fight is still going on against terrorism, transnational extremism and sleeper cells in the deserts of our country.\nWe cannot underestimate the threat posed by terrorism and the possibility that it may re-emerge or that the terrorists may reorganize. We believe that any relaxation in our response to terrorism or any preoccupation with regional conflicts would allow obscurantist forces to regroup and gain strength. Similarly, if we surrender in the fight against rampant corruption or with regard to interference in the domestic affairs of our sovereign States, that will hinder efforts to combat terrorism and extremism.\nAgainst this backdrop, we hope to receive aid from all friendly countries in the international community in order to locate smuggled funds and identify corrupt people who smuggle money for financing outlaw and extremist groups. Corruption is a scourge suffered by many countries. It has stripped many Iraqis of their country\u2019s resources. For many years, corruption has contributed to the destruction of Iraq. The Iraqi people are bitter and angry about the impact of corruption.\nLast year, when I spoke before the General Assembly, I called for the creation of an international coalition against corruption and for the recovery of pillaged money. It would be a coalition similar to the International Coalition Against Terrorism. Today I reiterate that same appeal. We cannot eradicate terrorism if we do not dry up its financing. That is the only way to do it. We also need to eradicate corruption, which is the very basis of policies related to violence and terrorism. Corruption destroys State economies and hinders our people in their efforts to achieve progress and prosperity.\nWe must now address the crime of genocide and the massacres of the Yazidi people in Iraq. These acts were aimed at ending that people\u2019s existence. For this reason, the international community must stand shoulder to shoulder with Iraq to ensure that such crimes are not committed again in the future.\nA few days ago, I attended a meeting of Iraqi women \u2014 more specifically Yazidi, Shi\u2019ite Turks of Iraq and Shabak citizens \u2014 who survived barbaric acts and the atrocities of terrorism. I heard them express the pain they continue to endure more than three years after the liberation of their cities. These women continue to endure the psychological and physical trauma caused by genocide, forced displacement and physical and moral torture to which they are subjected. They continue to live in camps. That is why we must strive to ensure the return of displaced persons and refugees to their towns and villages. It will require great effort on our part and on the part of our friends and the international Organization.\nIraq has experienced more than 40 years of war, suffering, blockades and terrorism. We have suffered more recently from the sharp drop in oil prices on the global market and from the impact of the economic havoc caused by COVID-19. The drop in oil prices has coincided with the pandemic threat. As a result, we have had to suddenly face major challenges.\nApproximately one year ago, Iraq also experienced a popular uprising, during which all citizens clamoured for change that would enable the aspirations of Iraqis to be met. They called for active dialogue with regard to the State\u2019s foundations, managing the country\u2019s affairs and their rights. Reforms have started in the country but we need time to achieve the desired results. Measures already under way which demonstrate that peaceful and constitutional change away from violence. That is what the Iraqis want.\nAgainst this backdrop, a new Government was formed this year. It is led by Mustafa Al-Khidimi. The Government was formed in response to the calls for reform heard during the popular uprising. Following our experience of authoritarianism in Iraq, we can now say that the current situation, the status quo, cannot continue. The Iraqi people wish to usher in a new political era so that they can combat the structural imbalances in Iraqi power mechanisms that have existed since 2003.\nIraqis want good governance. In response to the public will, the new Government shoulders heavy responsibilities. First, we need structural reforms in the political, economic and management spheres. We must combat corruption and corrupt individuals \u2014 another facet of terrorism.\nAmong the basic tasks the new Government must discharge is the holding of early elections next year. These elections must be fair and transparent based on new electoral law. They must be more representative and fairer and meet the demands of major national popular uprisings. They must meet the legitimate aspirations of Iraqis and their desire for democracy. Iraqis aspire to a life of freedom and decency. Power must belong to Iraqis. They must speak up. The Government must emanate from them and safeguard their interests and meet their demands.\nThe Government is also called upon another task that is not less important \u2014 that is, to have monopoly over weapons by preventing their possession and use in unlawful contexts. Weapons must remain in the hands of Iraqi State institutions. We must also pursue our inquiries into crimes committed against protesters and members of the security forces. The fight against groups operating outside of the law and the issue of arms control are part of a tireless struggle waged by the Iraqi State against anarchists and extremists. This is not an easy task. However, we must continue work towards peace within our societies and ensure Iraqi sovereignty.\nThe latest communique released by the Shi\u2019ite supreme authority, Ayatollah Ali Sistani, following his meeting with the Representative of the Secretary-General in Iraq, clearly outlined these various duties to reform the course of the ongoing political process and rid it from corruption and weaknesses. With that in mind, we hope to receive the support of the United Nations in its coordination with electoral authorities. We also hope to receive technical assistance, which will guarantee fair elections and ensure the prevention of manipulation, forgery and extortion. Iraqi citizens must not be influenced in their electoral choice.\nOur national goal is to establish a strong State capable of imposing the rule of law and upholding the rights of its citizens. We do not want Iraq to become an arena for conflicts or the settling of scores of others on its territories. We have endured enough wars, siege and terrorism with attacks on our sovereignty. An independent and sovereign Iraq will be a meeting point for the common interests of the peoples and countries of the region based on economic and security cooperation in order to combat terrorism and extremism.\nWe look forward to enjoying the effective support of our neighbours and the international community for our national endeavour, which will have a great impact on the future of Iraq, the region and the world.\nIn that context, Iraq stresses its position on the need to resolve the Palestinian question. The rights of the Palestinian people must be achieved by establishing its independent State. That would help to achieve stability of the region and the entire world.\nToday I recall our martyrs, who have sacrificed their lives for freedom and for the fight against terrorism. I commend our young people who, day after day, demonstrate their determination to live a free and decent life. We optimistically look towards the future. Let us continue to support our young people as they walk the path of freedom, rule of law, sovereignty and justice.\nIn conclusion, I reiterate our gratitude to the United Nations as we mark its seventy-fifth anniversary. There is no alternative to the Organization, which brings us together despite all our differences, especially at a time when we face transnational challenges, such as pandemics, climate change, food security-related problems and the issue of migration. All of these issues can be addressed only through the United Nations and its Charter.\nThere is no doubt whatsoever that the global order has failed over the past 75 years. We recall such bitter experiences as the genocide in Rwanda, the wars and massacres suffered by the Iraqi people and the ongoing crises in Syria and Libya. We must learn from the past. We must ensure that the Sustainable Development Goals can evolve. We must strive for reform within the United Nations so that the Organization can meet the peoples\u2019 aspirations.\nThank you for your kind attention. We pray to Almighty God that our next meeting will be held in a pandemic-free world but also in a world free of any other virus, such as hatred, corruption, war or terrorism.\nMay peace and God\u2019s mercy and blessings be upon you."

        "file_text": "Secretary General,\nPresident of the General Assembly,\nExcellencies,\nThe current global pandemic has taught how truly interconnected and interdependent our world is.\nIt affected our health, our economies and our societies.\nHowever, at a time when multilateralism is threatened, a health crisis brought into focus the need for global cooperation.\nAnd 75 years after the setting up of this organisation \u2014 the United Nations, we find ourselves yet again in a position where we need to work together to overcome another common challenge.\nIt gives us a chance to create a better life, a better future.\nA future where solidarity is global.\nA future for which we have the opportunity to prepare and to identify better and more creative ways to deliver on our 2030 Agenda.\nIn this regard, whilst the pandemic has dealt a devastating blow to the economic and social development of all countries, especially developing countries, we must not be disheartened.\nYes, years will be needed to come back to the stage where we were before the start of the pandemic.\nBut it is also true that the stage has been set to build a healthier, greener, fairer and more resilient and sustainable world that ensures that no country or person is left behind.\nI therefore firmly believe that our collective efforts need to be stepped up. As does our coordination to ensure the successful implementation of the Goals in their entirety.\nAchieving the SDGs and harnessing the potential they represent is beyond the reach of any single country.\nReaching out to the hardest hit countries, the most fragile economies and also those populations in vulnerable situations remains crucial.\nHere, I wish to recall a point that in my opinion is very important \u2014 food security. This goes hand in hand with agriculture and has also been highlighted in the Global Humanitarian Response Plan and recognised as one of the strategic priorities to mitigate the problems associated with hunger.\nThe agricultural sector is the fulcrum if we want to end hunger.\nWe need to continue working on achieving a more sustainable agriculture through adaptation of sustainable practices.\nPractices that respect our ecosystem and our environment.\nEarlier this year, at the height of the pandemic, Malta was facing a crisis in its agricultural exports.\nConscious that it is our collective responsibility to promote food security and provide adequate nutrition, under the initiative of \u201cSolidarjeta\u2019 Malta\u201d \u2014 an initiative aimed at addressing food shortage in afflicted countries,we sent food to Namibia. Malta is a small country and our contribution is an act of solidarity with the people, taking into consideration the effects the severe drought the country had experienced.\nThis initiative fed around half a million persons in Namibia, prevented food waste in Malta and yielded an opportunity for the long-term benefit of both countries.\nIt also puts into practice our belief that we cannot build our future without helping others to build theirs. We need to establish meaningful and effective partnerships through which to combine efforts and programmes for more substantial and durable results.\nThis we are currently doing also through our co-Chairing of the UN Steering Committee on\nPartnerships for Small Island Developing States.\nMalta has also contributed a significant percentage of its annual humanitarian budget towards appeals launched by United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, International Committee of the Red Cross, Food and Agricultural Organisation, United Nations Children-Fund and World Food Programme, in support of the agencies\u2019 operations to mitigate the effects of the pandemic in vulnerable places.\nAside from hunger, COVID-19 also posed another serious obstacle to the wellbeing of the alreadyvulnerable civilian populations of war-stricken countries. As the Prime Minister of a country that advocates peace and has a neutrality clause in its Constitution, I cannot but reiterate the message for all parties involved in such conflicts to desist from ongoing hostilities.\nTo take immediate action to protect civilians within their areas of effective control.\nAnd to ensure the depoliticization of the humanitarian infrastructure, through the lifting of restrictions imposed on humanitarian workers and life-saving aid deliveries\nAgainst this background, Malta welcomes the announcements made by the Libyan President of the Presidential Council, His Excellency Fayez al-Serraj and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, H.E. Aguila Saleh, for a ceasefire in Libya.\nThis is an instrumental and constructive step to overcome the current stalemate and terminate all foreign interference in the country.\nNow is the time to translate the outcomes of the 5+5 Joint Military Committee into a permanent ceasefire to enable the resumption of talks with a view to achieve a successful political transition under the auspices of the United Nations.\nSimilarly, the recent announcements made concerning the lifting of the blockade on oil infrastructure need to be substantiated and coupled with the implementation of economic reforms.\nReforms that enhance the governance of Libya\u2019s economic and financial institutions, and that enable the fair and transparent distribution of oil proceeds to all of Libya\u2019s society.\nThis will enable Libya to address challenges related to its already strained healthcare services, worn thin by the ongoing nine-year conflict, to the detriment of Libya and the Libyan People.\nAt the same time, we must also ensure that all actors found violating international humanitarian law and human rights in Libya will be held accountable.\nThis will send a clear message to all involved in the proxy war playing out in Libya that their impunity will not go unanswered.\nA political solution to the conflict in Libya remains the only viable solution. The driving force to resolve the conflict needs to be wholeheartedly Libyan-led and Libyan owned.\nIn this regard, I want to commend the Security Council for endorsing the conclusions of the Berlin Conference on Libya through Resolution 2510 (2020) and support the request of the Security Council in tasking the Secretary General to implement those aspects ascribed to UNSMIL in the operationalisation paper of the Berlin process.\nIn the same spirit, I wish to recall and reiterate the importance of the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2532 (2020), calling for a for a global ceasefire to address the pandemic.\nA pandemic that has affected economies at their core.\nA pandemic where we needed to act fast to implement tailored responses to aid the recovery when faced with increased poverty and inequality globally, as well a situation where wealth, progress and development were hindered.\nWith this in mind, Malta acted swiftly. We put forward initiatives that prevented an even larger economic and financial downturn.\nSeveral measures were implemented as part of a financial package to help the Maltese economy during the COVID-19 outbreak, mainly aimed at easing pressures on the liquidity of businesses, protecting jobs and helping the most vulnerable during this challenging period.\nThese included initiatives to protect employment and targeted assistance to those sectors that have been negatively affected.\nThis through an economic package worth \u20ac1.81 billion, equal to 12.9 per cent of Malta\u2019s GDP in 2019.\nWe were helped in no small way by the fact that we are a small nation, which brings decision-makers in close proximity to those effected by the said decisions as well as ensuring that they are not insulated from realities on the ground.\nIn all this, in hindsight, if I had to single out one area which was more important than others, this would be the world of work.\nThe pandemic has devastated the world of work, laying bare the extreme vulnerability of millions of workers and enterprises.\nThe virus does not discriminate in medical terms, however it has brought to the fore major inequalities which have been further exacerbated through threats to livelihoods.\nThis has brought a dramatic increase in poverty, and the warning from the World Food Programme that the next pandemic we face could be one of hunger.\nTherefore, in this case more than others, the future of our people is going to be determined by our actions today.\nKeeping this in mind, Malta implemented a series of social security measures in order to deal with the economic and social impact of the pandemic, ensuring that the economy remains afloat, safeguarding jobs, and assisting workers and vulnerable persons.\nSocial benefits helped to alleviate the financial difficulties.\nTo date, almost half a billion euro were paid out in contributory benefits whereas almost hundred million euro were paid out in non-contributory benefits.\nAs Heads of Governments we have a strong responsibility to protect our workers.\nFor in protecting livelihoods, we are protecting our social fabric.\nMalta holds a strong track record in the field of employment. The overall positive labour market outlook is a direct result of an integrated make-work-pay reform package aimed at investing in human capital through a number of targeted policies and measures to reach those groups identified at being most at risk of labour market alienation.\nThe exponential economic growth which Malta has experienced in the last few years has been connected with sustained employment. And prior to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, Malta enjoyed the highest employment growth rate in the European Union.\nTo protect our achievements, during Malta\u2019s worst period of the COVID-19 pandemic, we encouraged employers to implement, where possible, teleworking, flexible working hours and to implement temporary short-time working conditions so to avoid redundancies.\nDespite the urgency of the matter and the necessary short-term measures that needed to be implemented, we always kept in view the long-term repercussions of the pandemic on the world of work, and tailored measures to provide protections for both employees and employers alike.\nThis resulted in around 25,500 jobs out of a workforce of around 250,000 being saved while protecting many businesses from closing their doors.\nToday Malta\u2019s employment rate has also exceeded both the national and EU headline targets for Europe 2020.\nAnd as we look towards a \u201cnew normal\u201d, Malta continues to work towards taking a human-centred approach to reform related to the world of work.\nOur priority for the upcoming period is to continue building on what has been achieved so far by enhancing labour market access for all groups through continued upskilling, labour market incentives and by facilitating the transitions towards labour market participation as well as working towards promoting long term employability.\nIt is for this reason that we are seeking to prepare our youths for their future.\nFor if we cannot prepare a future for our youths, we owe it to them to provide them with the skills and tools necessary to succeed.\nInvestment in education and training, outlines Malta\u2019s long-term strategic outlook for an up-skilled society which is able to adapt to a modern, digital and sustainable labour market.\nIn doing so, we are also adapting to the situation, learning from the opportunities that have surfaced to increase our competitiveness and growth.\nLooking ahead, prior to the pandemic there were already discussions taking place at international level regarding the implications of technology on the future of work, the role of digitalisation and the green transition.\nThat future has arrived sooner than anticipated.\nIt is up to us to shape this future.\nMr President,\nWe can all agree Covid-19 has been a wake up call.\nPandemics know no creed, ethnicity, gender or social standing.\nWe are all equally susceptible and potential victims. It has been indeed a lesson in humility.\nIt is with this in mind that I look towards a future that is all about giving a voice.\nEconomic, social, cultural, civil and political rights are fundamental to the success of the public health response and recovery from the pandemic, which is why it is imperative that these rights are fully respected even in difficult times such as the present.\nWith this in mind, we made it a must that our integrated approach was disability inclusive and thus ensured that this equally important section of our society is safeguarded and protected.\nThe outbreak of this pandemic put a spotlight on the resilience of health systems. I hereby quote the United Nations Secretary General when I say \u201cwe are only as strong as the weakest health system.\u201d\nWe all have a lot to learn from each other, and this pandemic has shown that international cooperation and collaboration across continents is paramount. It is for this reason that I look towards a future where the global public good is upheld above all.\nIt is with pride to note that throughout this pandemic, Malta has worked in close collaboration with the World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease, following guidelines and contributing regularly through the sharing of best practices at ministerial level in regular European Region and global updates, as well as bilaterally at country level.\nWe strongly support the WHO in its work.\nAnd for this reason we advocate for WHO\u2019s important role in ensuring early, equitable and universal access to a safe, quality, and, effective COVID-19 vaccine, as a global public good, once this becomes available.\nOnly by joining forces can we prevent, contain and stop transmission in order to bring the pandemic to an end. This is a time for solidarity and for continued collaboration to mitigate the crisis \u2014 each individual\u2019s health depends on the health of us all.\nMr President,\nBefore concluding, I must say a couple of words about the deep rooted link between humans and the environment.\nWhilst the immediate priority of countries around the globe is the restarting of the economy and the protection of people\u2019s health, we cannot side-line environmental issues and the need to move closer to carbon neutrality.\nIt is for this reason that I look towards a future where we have a carbon neutral planet by 2050.\nBecause if anything, the pandemic has highlighted the value of our quality of life and the protection of human health.\nThis is why, when we announced my country\u2019s long-term economic vision for 2050 a couple of days ago, we made it a point to include carbon neutrality as one of its pillars of our economic policy.\nAs economic growth has very little meaning if people are not living a better life.\nWe must therefore invest all our efforts to address challenges related to pollution, air quality, cleanliness and emmissions. We cannot forget the millions of premature deaths linked to air pollution every year. We have an obligation to act without delay.\nMr President,\nTo conclude and above all I we look forward towards a secure future, where victims and peoples who are most at risk feel protected and safeguarded.\nIn this vein, I cannot but add my voice to that of others to identify a good humane approach to deal with the global challenges being brought about by illegal migration.\nIn the past 12 months Malta become a member of the UNHCR Executive Committee and acceded to the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, and more recently, it officially joined the UNODC Blue Heart Campaign against Human Trafficking.\nBut unfortunately, in recent months we have also seen an exacerbation of the situation with COVID19 having a major impact on migrants and refugees.\nFurthermore, the socio-economic impact of the pandemic on migrants and refugees, the loss of livelihoods and the significant blow to remittances worldwide are expected to create a situation where more people are vulnerable to exploitation by smugglers and human traffickers.\nOn this, Interpol has advised that the COVID-19 pandemic has not blunted the determination of organised crime groups to prey on the vulnerable and make a profit from these crimes, which all too often cost these victims their life.\nMalta, as one of the frontline countries at the EU\u2019s external border, is faced every day with irregular crossings.\nThese people want a better life but my country is small and our capacity to handle such flows is very limited. The EU has today launched its migration package but the UN also has a major role in addressing this human and global challenge.\nIt must work with its agencies and partners around the world to help people build a better life so that less people are victims of people smugglers and lives are saved.\nThe UN can also support States in the implementation of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration and the Global Compact for Refugees adopted in December 2018.\nMigration is a phenomenon that needs to be managed not turned into a business commodity traded at the cost of the most vulnerable.\nFurthermore, at a time when the international community is still seeking to chart the way forward in an ever-uncertain landscape, the role of multilateral institutions \u2014 with the United Nations at their core \u2014 remains crucial to preserving stability and security and addressing threats that defy physical or imagined borders.\nIt is for this reason that our future should be one where multilateralism is indispensable.\nTherefore, Mr President\nExcellencies\nMy parting message in this first virtual United Nations General Assembly is on the importance of multilateralism.\nThe effect of this health crisis will be felt for much longer than expected unless we engage in the strategic rebuilding of social and economic systems.\nAnd this can only be made possible using a multilateral approach, based on the principles of social justice and solidarity, that leave no one behind.\nGoing forward, we need a frank discussion on how to ensure resilience in our supply chains. The objective, should be that of strengthening and stabilising our commercial ties and seeking cooperative approaches to address any future crisis that might with similar implications to the one we are experiencing today.\nAs we celebrate the 75th Anniversary since the setting up of the United Nations, if we want to ensure that its legacy lives on, we need to act now.\nTo do this we cannot shy away from working together.\nFirm in this belief, Malta is seeking to serve the international community within the highest and most important of bodies. A country whose aspiration is to promote peace and security, equality, social solidarity, Malta is seeking election as a non-Permanent Member of the United Nations Security Council for the term 2023-2024.\nThank you"

        "file_text": "In the name of God the Merciful and the Compassionate,\nYour Excellency, President of the United Nations General Assembly,\nYour Majesties and Excellencies,\nI would like at the outset to sincerely congratulate the President of the United Nations General Assembly at its seventy-fifth session and to wish him continued success in his endeavours. I would also like to express my sincere thanks and gratitude to the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, for his efforts in leading the Organization towards playing its role in protecting international peace and security and realizing its noble mission. That will be reflected on all peoples and countries, including the Republic of Yemen.\nThe United Nations, thankfully, has spared no effort to reach a lasting peace in Yemen, and sought tirelessly to address the challenges that we are facing, in particular the humanitarian challenges.\nIt is my honour also to sincerely congratulate the great people of Yemen, those living in the country or living abroad, on the celebrations of the glorious and eternal Yemeni revolution in September and October. That coincides with the general debate of the United Nations General Assembly.\nThis year\u2019s session of the General Assembly is the sixth being held as we in the Republic of Yemen endure difficult and harsh circumstances as a result of the war imposed upon our people by the Houthi coup militia, backed up by Iran, which is its regional supporter. This militia hatched its plans following the execution of the Gulf Initiative, with its Implementation Mechanism, and coinciding with the successful holding of the comprehensive National Dialogue Conference, which established a road map for the future of the Republic of Yemen, with the participation of the entire political spectrum.\nThe Houthi militia, which sent its representatives to the NDC, did not welcome these developments. It started at the same time to prepare for a coup d\u2019etat against the country. It began to mobilize its forces to ensure the collapse of towns and cities and displace citizens from their homes and regions. It even invaded the capital, Sana\u2019a, in September 2014, took State institutions hostage and undermined the elected legitimacy and the political climate. It suppressed freedoms, raided houses and blew up schools and places of worship. It suppressed dissenting voices and harassed citizens. This militia transformed Sana\u2019a, a city steeped in history, civilization and a tradition of coexistence, into a great prison while putting our people behind bars.\nThe United Nations played a pivotal and outstanding role in overseeing the political transition process in Yemen, which has been ongoing since 2011. According to the Gulf Initiative and its Implementation Mechanism, that was the start of the transition period. A national Government was formed and presidential elections took place. The National Dialogue Conference was held with the participation of all strata of Yemeni society. A new Yemeni Constitution was drafted in accordance with the outcome of that dialogue. It was supposed to be subjected to a referendum by the Yemeni people and then adopted to allow for elections to be held in line with the new Constitution. However, the Houthi coup d\u2019etat disrupted the transitional process and led to a war against the people of Yemen.\nThis war imposed on us has caused a humanitarian catastrophe, destroyed our society and led to waves of collective displacement. It has also caused repression, forced disappearances and the worst cases of poverty ever seen by our people for decades. We extended our hands for peace. We have done our utmost to support and facilitate the efforts of the United Nations and its current Special Envoy, Mr. Martin Griffiths, as well as those of previous Envoys, with a view to saving our country and establishing a lasting and comprehensive peace. The goal is to stop the bloodletting in Yemen and the Yemeni catastrophe because our Yemeni people will not accept the Iranian model on its territory, regardless of the circumstances and challenges.\nLet us recall the concessions that we have made in the quest for peace over the past five years. We had a commitment a few months ago \u2014 alongside our brothers in the coalition to support Yemeni legitimacy, led by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \u2014 to establishing a unilateral ceasefire and supporting the efforts of Mr. Martin Griffiths for a lasting and comprehensive ceasefire that would allow the political process to be resumed. However, these efforts regrettably failed because of the obstinacy of the Houthi terrorist militia and its sponsors from the Iranian regime. What is even worse is that this militia took the opportunity to mobilize and attack governorates and cities, causing more massacres among civilians in several regions and cities in Yemen.\nWhat you see today is a ruthless escalation by these militias, particularly in the governorates of Ma\u2019rib, Al-Jawf and Al-Bayda, where the Houthi militia has engaged in an indiscriminate military campaign for several months. It attacks residential areas with ballistic missiles, with no concern whatsoever for civilian lives or the millions of displaced people who have fled the regions under the militia\u2019s control. These terrorist militias repeatedly target civilians and civilian infrastructure in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. All this clearly demonstrates their true intentions and how they view peace.\nThe international community must play its role to end the Houthi arrogance and the people\u2019s suffering. It must exert effective and decisive pressure on the putschists and their sponsor in Tehran to ensure that they implement Security Council resolutions and refrain from bloodletting, sowing destruction and giving access for humanitarian assistance to all Yemenis.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to speak to the world and shed light on the suffering of our patient people, who have endured tragedy and torture of all kinds amid difficult living conditions because of the putschists\u2019 war. We thank all our brothers, friends, organizations and donor countries for their efforts and support. They too have been unable to escape blackmail, constraints and siege when attempting to mitigate the multifaceted suffering of the Yemeni people as the war continues. Economic challenges are on the increase, in addition to the obstacles that face the Government and State institutions in their attempt to discharge their duties by providing the citizens with services and restore normalcy in liberated areas.\nI call on the international community to support Government efforts to address economic challenges and policies and plans to strengthen the national currency with a view to ensuring household stability. The international community should not allow the Houthis to manipulate humanitarian aid or blackmail the Government by looting funds earmarked for the payment of salaries. They continue to undermine United Nations efforts in this regard.\nI call on the international community to make a serious and urgent commitment to ending the imminent catastrophe surrounding the FSO SAFER oil tanker. The Houthi militias refuse to grant the United Nations access to the oil tanker for repair and maintenance.\nWith the unlimited support from our brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we have made much progress in implementing the Riyadh Agreement, which is aimed at establishing stability and enabling us to address the regrettable events that took place in the provisional capital, Aden, in August 2019. We have done our utmost to facilitate the implementation of the agreement because we believe that we must pool our efforts to ensure reconstruction and development, under the auspices of the State. We reiterate the trust in our brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to continue to implement this agreement.\nIn conclusion, I hope that this session will be successful, and that the United Nations will be more advanced and effective in its efforts to support humankind and realize happiness. I hope that the United Nations resolutions will help us meet the major challenges before us. I wish development and prosperity for all Member States and their populations. I also wish happiness, well-being and prosperity for humankind as a whole.\nMay peace and God\u2019s mercy and blessings be upon you."

        "file_text": "Honourable President of the Assembly, Excellencies, Distinguished guests, Ladies and gentleman,\nIt is a great honour and privilege to address you all on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the United Nations. On this special 75th anniversary of our multilateral global union for peace, progress and prosperity, it is fundamental to recommit ourselves to the UN Charter and its broad-based consensus on effective cooperation for common sustainable international development. Consensus, cooperation and targeted common action have never been more important than at this time, where the world is challenged politically, socially and economically by the COVID-19 health pandemic.\nIn assessing the way forward to achieving the agreed Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic, we must also re-examine the future we all want and the United Nations we need to attain it. COVID-19 has been a devastating lesson and the loudest possible wake-up call in the need for global cooperation, effective partnerships and the firm commitment to multilateralism to confront it together. COVID-19 recognizes no borders, nationality, gender or economic status of nations or individuals \u2014 we are all equally victims. Therefore, a unifying solution must be found to protect every human being from it.\nIn Somalia, our government and people have worked closely together to mitigate the worst effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Like most governments across the world, we prioritized the health of our citizens and did as much as possible to save lives. Through direct medical provision and consistent, updated and effective public health information, our government did its utmost to keep our population as safe as possible. COVID-19 cases, which were rising quickly at the early stages of the pandemic, have fallen steadily as a result of our government\u2019s swift actions.\nAgain, this successful response would not have been possible without the effective partnership between our government, citizens and international partners. I want to pay special tribute to all of our courageous and dutiful health personnel who risked their lives to save others. I also recognize the patience and contribution of the Somali private sector, which worked with the government to keep the economy functioning, providing vital services to the Somali people at the most critical hour of need.\nYet, the success of our common efforts in Somalia does not mean that we are unscathed. According to official statistics, over 3,000 Somalis were infected by the virus and around 100 tragically lost their lives as a result. Many more who were diagnosed had to live with the pain and the suffering of COVID-19 and others still remain vulnerable given the weakness of Somalia\u2019s overstretched health systems and infrastructure.\nGiven the grave health challenges posed to the world, in particular the most vulnerable nations like Somalia, I feel confident that with greater public health collaboration, information sharing and an equitable distribution of the potential COVID-19 health treatments currently in development, we can permanently reverse the deadly impact of the virus for every human being on the planet. This is the only way we can secure our common future and, therefore, it is a must that we, as a community of nations, reaffirm our collective commitment to multilateralism and confront COVID-19 through effective and coordinated multilateral action.\nExcellencies, Distinguished guests, Ladies and gentleman,\nAcross the world, economies of all sizes have been severely impacted by COVID-19 with the most vulnerable affected the most. In Somalia, like everywhere else in the world, we are challenged by a painful contraction of the economy, job losses and the need to continue investing in our essential basic public services to protect our citizens from the deadly virus. You can all appreciate, this is a huge task for a recovering post-conflict state like Somalia but our government will remain steadfast in rising and responding to the diverse challenges that lie ahead.\nOur government\u2019s economic policy response to COVID-19 has, once again, been to put our people first with tax relief for most key staple food items. Now, hoping that the worst is behind us, we are cautiously starting to open up our economy to ensure that normal life can resume for our people. However, we also understand the huge challenge that building back better, stronger and more equitably from the COVID-19 impact will be for Somalia.\nIn reiterating the importance of confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action, I want to recognize the enabling economic and financial support provided to the Somali Federal Government to mitigate the worst of the COVID-19 economic pressures by the International Financial Institutions and many other multilateral institutions after Somalia successfully reached the Decision Point and attained debt relief from many of its major international creditors. As we progress towards achieving debt cancellation through our enabling economic reforms, we remain cognizant that Somalia\u2019s economic future and the prosperity of its people are closely interlinked with that of the rest of the world. In this regard, the future we want in Somalia is one which promotes greater partnership for international trade, enhances foreign direct investment in key productive sectors which has the potential to feed the world and the development of human capital to create further opportunities for us all. The United Nations we need is an inclusive global multilateral platform for propelling not just the ideas and aspirations of change but their realization too. COVID-19 has economically challenged us all and if the Sustainable Development Goals are to ever be realized, the world must recover better, for all, and together.\nExcellencies, Distinguished guests, Ladies and gentleman,\nGlobal crises like the COVID-19 pandemic provide both an opportunity for renewal and a challenge to overcome. We have seen the devastating health and economic impact of the virus and we are all feeling and living with the painful results. No nation, no matter how well resourced, is immune. Yet, despite our common suffering and pain, I am fearful that COVID-19 has, and will continue to, exacerbate the already existing gulf between the developed, developing and fragile states that make up the UN family. This is something that must be avoided at all costs as tackling today\u2019s major global challenges, including insecurity, climate change, poverty and the increasing inequality, which is the driver of much division and discontent across the world, depend on effective cooperation and multilateral actions which bring the Sustainable Development Goals to fruition.\nSomalia is working through, and with, the UN to create a better future for Somalia and the world. We are taking the lead in delivering development to our people and working with our valuable international partners to ensure we rebuild a democratic, inclusive and economically prosperous Somalia. Despite the challenges of COVID-19, we are still working hard to undertake inclusive national elections where the Somali people can determine their future. We are firmly committed to promoting and instilling a strong tradition of democracy and accountable governance which serves the Somali people first and foremost.\nWe are also successfully defeating the menace of global terrorism with the efforts of our brave armed forces in collaboration with AMISOM and other international partners to make the world a safer place. I am confident with our government\u2019s efforts and the continued support of our important international partners, Somalia will not only confront COVID-19 but it will contribute positively to the multilateral effort required to make the world a better, more resilient and equal place for all.\nLooking forward, it is fundamental that we fully realize the Sustainable Development Goals for each and every citizen of this world. We cannot afford to leave anyone behind. This means that the United Nations will also have to improve further, innovate faster and deliver better for the most fragile nations and vulnerable communities. The UN can do this by supporting national and personal development through assisting and strengthening national institutional frameworks, systematic knowledge transfer and investment in human capital. These are real long-term investments that will actually contribute to poverty alleviation and the creation of opportunities for all.\nIn conclusion, the United Nations and the family of nations which comprise its membership must work together through renewed partnership to confront COVID-19. We must also continue to engage each other positively to create the inclusive and prosperous future we want with and through the United Nations we need. In this regard, we, in Somalia, reaffirm our commitment to multilateralism to overcome all common global obstacles and to capitalize on every opportunity to create a better, safer and equal world."

        "file_text": "Your Excellency, Mr. Volkan Bozkir, I extend congratulations on your election to the Presidency of this 75th Session of the General Assembly.\nI also commend your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, for maintaining the focus on social justice and climate action as critical elements of the Decade of Recovery.\nYour Excellency, during your term of office, you can be confident of Jamaica\u2019s continued commitment to the global recovery effort through a multilateral approach to finding viable solutions to the pandemic.\nMr. President,\nJamaica welcomes the significance and timeliness of this special theme to commemorate the 75th UN General Assembly. Indeed, the future to which we aspire is contingent on an effective and renewed multilateral system, in which the United Nations must play a pivotal role.\nPrior to the advent of the pandemic, Jamaica had been recording significant progress in our pursuit of economic independence, through macro-economic stability, reduction in our high levels of public debt, poverty alleviation, human capital formation and increased employment opportunities, while protecting the vulnerable in our society.\nThis placed us in a position to implement an initial social and economic stimulus programme, in addition to our early response to control the spread of the coronavirus and to treat those infected.\nHowever, our economy now faces the triple challenges of reduced revenues, increased health and social expenditures, and an ongoing climate crisis, which threatens to undo years of hard-won development gains.\nMr. President,\nThe pandemic has highlighted pre-existing vulnerabilities and multiple structural weaknesses within our economies - large and small, rich and poor - and clearly demonstrated the systemic nature of risk worldwide.\nThe great differences lie however, in our respective abilities to mitigate the development reversals arising from the multi-faceted impact of the pandemic, and to recover stronger.\nDeveloping countries must therefore devise strategies to respond effectively. We must rebalance our economies and rethink the nature of global cooperation so that we not only recover stronger but position ourselves to become more resilient to future systemic shocks.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the interconnectedness and interdependence of our world. It has underscored the need for strengthened and renewed multilateralism. As we strive to respond and recover stronger, we must re-imagine the way nations cooperate. Persistent global problems require consistent cooperation to achieve strategic global solutions.\nSmall Caribbean States, which are designated as middle-income countries, but whose small economies are largely dependent on one or just a few industries, are most deeply affected by this crisis. They urgently need increased access to concessional and non-concessional financing, given their limited fiscal space, reduced availability of public resources for investment and the struggle to attract private investment.\nWe see access to international development finance and the establishment of special funds to complement our response, as an imperative and we endorse the Secretary-General\u2019s call for solidarity. I therefore, convey Jamaica\u2019s sincere appreciation to the United Nations for establishing its COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund and encourage donor countries to contribute.\nThis Fund represents an excellent example of the effectiveness of multilateralism at work. Its inclusion of vulnerable middle income countries recognizes the reality that if one member of the global community fails, the potential exists for all others to be impacted. The entire international community will therefore reap benefits from the support provided.\nAn area which requires particular support from such a fund or similar cooperation mechanism is the \u201cdigital divide\u201d. The pandemic has forced schools and workplaces to close and people to practice social distancing. The internet has become our public square to meet and access critical information. However, approximately half of the world\u2019s population is still not connected to the internet. With school, work, healthcare, commerce and religious worship going online, persons without access to a reliable internet connection may be marginalised and disconnected entirely. Now more than ever before it is imperative that the \u201cdigital divide\u201d not only be closed, but that countries are enabled to provide universal access to connectivity as well as the tools to allow their societies and economies to capture the power of digital technologies.\nUniversal, secure and affordable connectivity is essential for greater participation in the global digital economy and for the attainment of inclusive and sustainable development. The pandemic has greatly accelerated the adoption of digital technologies and has provided developing countries in particular with an opportunity to leapfrog to a more digital economy. We call on the global community to respond with increased bi-lateral and multi-lateral cooperation in this area which promises exponential increase in human capacity and economic dividends.\nWe are heartened by the understanding, cohesion and clarity for action displayed by the G20 Digital Economy Ministers in their July 2020 Declaration, the UNSG\u2019s High Level Panel on Digital Cooperation and last month\u2019s Report of the Task Force on Digital Financing of the SDGs. All hands and ideas must be on deck for our national and collective digital resilience.\nMr. President,\nMyself as co-convener of the High Level Event on Financing for Development in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond, along with Secretary-General Guterres and Prime Minister Trudeau, remain committed to facilitate the process of developing concrete global solutions and actions to enable countries to respond and recover better from what the Secretary-General refers to as the world\u2019s first \u201cdevelopment emergency\u201d. On September 29, when we convene the Second High Level Event, leaders will have an opportunity to highlight the collective measures they deem most effective for resolving the crisis and to also put forward recommendations for United Nations support. We look forward to hearing the actions proposed, including, those related to the closure of the \u201cdigital divide\u201d with a view to enabling robust and resilient recovery.\nMr. President,\nWe note with grave concern, UN reports that women and girls continue to face discrimination globally, and that there are persistent gaps in their participation in economic activity, decision making and political leadership. We have seen that the pandemic has deepened socio-economic inequalities and disproportionately impacted women and girls, leading to increased exposure to domestic violence and loss of livelihoods.\nWe are taking measures to ensure that our national recovery efforts include a gender perspective and harness the full potential of all members of society as leaders, innovators and agents of economic, social and environmental change.\nWe are committed to furthering our engagement with the UN and our international partners to implement the Spotlight Initiative and to increase our advocacy through mechanisms such as the Groups of Friends on: Women\u2019s Economic Empowerment, Gender Parity, and Women, Peace and Security.\nMr. President,\nThere is no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic has propelled the United Nations to a critical crossroads. It has exposed and exacerbated the gross inequalities that still exist. It has further reinforced the need for the international community to scale-up cooperation to respond to the growing and deepening health crisis.\nThe rapid spread of the novel coronavirus is exerting immense pressure on health-care systems globally, many of which were already under stress. It has compounded existing disparities in health, and increased the risks for the vulnerable, particularly the elderly and persons requiring medical care for non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Given our limited fiscal space we have adopted a whole of government approach to the pandemic, while mobilizing the support of all our citizens.\nThe pandemic has brought to the fore the importance of investing in NCDs prevention and care. Bridging the investment gap for prevention and treatment of NCDs must therefore be an essential pillar for our response to the pandemic and health security. We thank our bilateral and international partners including PAHO/ WHO, for their invaluable support and advice in our efforts to address this health crisis and its socio-economic impact.\nAs the international community works in earnest to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, Jamaica welcomes efforts aimed at accelerating the equitable access to vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics. We believe that the ambition to expedite development of these tools must be matched with a determination to ensure that they are safe, effective and accessible to all.\nMr. President,\nIn keeping with our commitment to the full realization of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Jamaica is deeply invested in finding solutions at the national, regional and multilateral levels to respond effectively and decisively to this pandemic. The immense challenges demand that, as a global community, we combine our efforts in a sustained and coordinated manner to identify opportunities for effective remedial action.\nAs we seek to create the future we want, we must summon our energies, talent and resources, to combat this global crisis with fortitude. We must, Mr. President, act collectively, decisively, and immediately. Our decisions now will determine the kind of future we create. Let us, together, do the right thing!\nI thank you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nSecretary General,\nExcellences,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nIt is my pleasure to address you today on behalf of Montenegro and to reaffirm our strong, unequivocal support and commitment to the mission of the World Organization, 75 years long.\nWe welcome the election of Volkan Bozkir as President of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly and wish him success in performing this duty. We assure him of the full support of the Montenegrin delegation along the way.\nWe also owe a debt of gratitude to his predecessor, Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, for his leadership and for ensuring smooth functioning and fulfilment of the United Nations General Assembly mandate.\nMr. Chairman,\nThe topic of this year\u2019s debate faithfully depicts one of the key challenges international community is facing, upon which we must work together in order to devise an effective and a comprehensive response. 75 years have passed since the founding of the World Organization, which today is more needed and relevant than ever before. In the conditions of various threats to international peace and security, changed and fragmented geopolitical realities, as well as unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is necessary to preserve and nurture unity and multilateralism, as the only possible modality of action and addressing global issues and challenges that overcome national borders. Indeed, today and in the future, we need the United Nations that stands behind what is written in the founding document and that inherits the highest civilizational values (on which the universality and timeless character of the Organization rests) \u2014 precisely those that brought us together in San Francisco in 1945.\nExcellences, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its multiple, devastating consequences on the lives of people around the world, loudly warn and remind us of the importance of international cooperation and solidarity in the process of creating global solutions to the issues that affect us all \u2014 no matter how big or small we are. I firmly believe that we can draw something good out of every difficulty, and in this case particular, I am certain that is the need for stronger joint action, based on trust, common values and interests, which must have no alternative in the period to come.\nAt a time when we are witnessing a negative trend of strengthening unilateralism and protectionism, and increasing deviation from multilateralism, Montenegro has no dilemma. Even more motivated, we remain committed to multilateralism based on universal values and principles, with a World Organization in its centre, capable of providing an adequate response to global crises, challenges and threats.\nIt is in this context we welcome the principal role of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who has effectively and responsibly coordinated a comprehensive response of the United Nations since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, in cooperation with all the interested stakeholders.\nThe response and recovery mechanisms created by the UN have made it possible to raise the necessary funds to provide assistance to the most vulnerable areas and countries, while his reviews of the pandemic impact on the economy, global conflicts, population, especially women and children, and regions and countries most affected by poverty and conflicts, continue to guide the activities of the UN system in order to effectively address the crisis and remedy its consequences.\nIncreasingly frequent regional and local, but also international conflicts, with historical, political and economic causes and consequences, threaten to destabilize the international order and the world as we know it. The United Nations must act as a defender of peace and stability., keep pace with the new realities and go through the path of adaptation in order to be able to perform their role even more efficiently.. Along that line, Montenegro strongly supports the necessary reforms of the United Nations system, including a comprehensive reform of the Security Council and the revitalization of the General Assembly, with the aim of building a more efficient, transparent, democratic and accountable United Nations, in which all parts of the world would be represented evenly.\nMontenegro is recognized as a pillar of peace and stability, a country of interethnic and interfaith harmony, committed to building partnerships and friendly relations not only with its closest neighbours, but also with the wider community. Multilateralism is one of our key foreign policy priorities, which is confirmed by our continuous aspiration to be part of societies that inherit the values and principles of togetherness and solidarity.\nTherefore, in the world of increasing geostrategic competitions, growing intensity and complexity of crises, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, we must emphasize the importance of promoting peace and security. We strongly support the Secretary General\u2019s call for a global ceasefire during the current pandemic, in order to give diplomacy a chance and create conditions for delivering humanitarian aid and support to the most vulnerable population.\nResponding after the outbreak of a conflict or crisis is often not enough, or it is not timely enough. We have to invest more attention to prevention \u2014 prevention of conflict, radicalization and violent extremism. In order to achieve such a thing, it is necessary to work on building unbiased and more inclusive societies that would offer equal opportunities for all, and to protect marginalized and most vulnerable groups, primarily women and youth. Montenegro strongly supports the implementation of two agendas \u2014 on women, peace and security, as well as on youth, peace and security, which we demonstrate continuously, with a large number of activities undertaken and implemented at the national level.\nWe face serious challenges to international security and stability, caused by a number of factors, such as the expiration of some of the most important agreements on limiting and controlling conventional and weapons of mass destruction, the return of Cold War tensions \u2014 now further complicated by the lack of constructive dialogue between key actors. Montenegro fully supports the implementation of relevant international instruments in the field of disarmament and arms control, as well as the Secretary General\u2019s Agenda for Disarmament. We emphasize the importance of universalization of the most important documents in this area, in order to preserve international peace, security and stability, and to create preconditions and conditions for a world without weapons of mass destruction.\nAt a time of growing challenges to human rights, democracy and the rule of law, Montenegro will continue to promote and support the integration of human rights and gender perspectives into all aspects of the functioning of the United Nations, and strive to preserve the universality of the international human rights law, as well as the independency of the UN human rights system as a whole. Montenegro is committed to bringing the agendas of Geneva and New York closer, and creating a better synergy between the Human Rights Council, the General Assembly and the Security Council.\nWe remain strongly committed to improving national human rights policies and frameworks. We have demonstrated this through excellent cooperation with key United Nations mechanisms, special procedures and treaty bodies, as well as with the Human Rights Council. I believe that the results achieved, as well as our continued strong commitment to further improving the position of women and girls, protection of the rights of children, the elderly, people with disabilities and LGBTI people, protection of media freedoms, civil society action, anti-discrimination on any grounds, impunity, as well as for unhindered access to international legal and human rights protection mechanisms, strongly recommended us for membership in the Human Rights Council (2022-2024) in the 2021 elections.\nWhen we talk about sustainable development goals, five years after their adoption, we can see that progress has been made in some areas. However, there are many clear indications that we need to do much more than it has been the case so far, that is, to redouble our efforts and move from words to actions. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a serious challenge and will undoubtedly affect the dynamics in achieving the set goals. The pandemic has slowed down our economies and taken us steps back. While the international community is assessing its consequences, it is also an opportunity to draw on good lessons and practices, in order to respond more effectively to possible challenges in the future.\nI wish to emphasize that Montenegro is one of the first countries to fully translate the goals and tasks of sustainable development into the National Strategy for Sustainable Development until 2030. Three years after the adoption of this document, we are recording positive trends on the way to achieving the set goals. However, at the same time, we are aware that these dynamics need to be stronger and that we still have a lot of work to do to reduce the risk of poverty and achieve a balanced development of all our regions, which we will work on with dedication.\nAs a member of the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), Montenegro actively participates in its work, strongly emphasizing the importance of cooperation, solidarity and multilateralism as the best solution to the current crisis, and better recovery in the times to come. I believe that we will continue at this pace, and that we will work dedicatedly to mobilize the widest possible range of partners in order to address the multiple consequences of the COVID-19 crisis on countries, communities and people.\nThe current pandemic has also confirmed that full implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement are key to preparing the world for future systemic shocks. In the coming period, we must use the Decade for Action in order to achieve the set goals by 2030. In addition, efforts to achieve universal health coverage and ensure access to a quality, affordable, inclusive and resilient health system must be intensified, with the World Health Organization at the forefront.\nIn order to build more inclusive, greener and sustainable economies, we need to focus policy solutions on those models of economic recovery that have the greatest potential for transformation and sustainable development. Acknowledging the significant economic and social potential of digitalization, Montenegro supported the Global Declaration on the Digital Response to COVID-19, as well as the Secretary General\u2019s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation, which represents an important milestone on the road to exploiting the potential of digital technologies.\nExcellences, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nMontenegro, as an independent state, a multi-ethnic and multiconfessional democracy, remains on the course set in 2006, when we restored our independence \u2014 and that is a Euro-Atlantic future and the nurturing of good neighbourly relations and multilateralism. We are on our way to the European community, affirming the capacities of the Montenegrin society and its institutions to successfully create all the necessary preconditions for such a thing. We firmly believe that our, but also the future of the entire Western Balkans region, is in Europe, and that only by consolidating such a position can we be responsible partners to the international community.\nWe are resolutely and continuously adopting and implementing reforms in various spheres, all with the aim of improving the quality of life of our citizens. As a country of rule of law and intensive economic growth, which is an example of the peaceful coexistence of different nations and religions under one roof, in harmony and tolerance, strongly committed to respecting human rights and freedoms and preserving the uniqueness of all of its peoples, we believe that only with a responsible and mature policy of tolerance and solidarity, we can be a credible factor in regional and international relations.\nMontenegro will remain committed to this path and will continue to actively and wholeheartedly contribute to the achievement of the goals of the United Nations.\nThank you for your attention."

        "file_text": "Dear President,\nYour Excellencies,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nIt is an honor for me to address you on behalf of Bosnia Herzegovina at this year\u2019s United Nations General Assembly. Although, due to extraordinary circumstances caused by the health crisis, we did not have the opportunity to gather at the UN headquarters, it is extremely important to exchange experiences and opinions in this manner, and to maintain the continuity of the United Nations General Assembly sessions.\nIn human life in general, and with that, in all aspects of social life, there aren\u2019t many things as important as dialogue. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that, this year as well, despite of the health crisis, this largest dialogue platform mankind has is still happening.\nFirst of all, I would like to congratulate Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande on a highly successful presiding over the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly. I would like to put a particular emphasis on that, having in mind the effort Mr. Bande has put forth, along with the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, in order to enable the General Assembly to be held this year.\nI would also like to congratulate Mr. Volkan Bozkir on being elected, with the message that he can always count on full support of Bosnia and Herzegovina in securing productive work of the General Assembly in the following year.\nDear President,\nThe coronavirus pandemic has most certainly marked this year in the world, and has brought us before challenges we could not even imagine before that. By taking, now already, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of lives, the pandemic has sown misfortune throughout the world; aggrieving numerous families, whose pain we truly sympathize with.\nAt the same time, this very dangerous plague has, in an instant, blocked all physical contacts and traffic between continents, regions, states, and, eventually, the everyday meetings between people. The only way to efficiently fight against it was to physically distance ourselves from each other. Having in mind the human habits and people\u2019s needs to socialize, it was very demanding, and, in the end, even traumatic, and it has caused enormous damage, primarily to economy, and then to the overall quality of life. Still, one should not forget that due to lack of the vaccine and proper therapy, this was the only way to fight for human lives, the preservation of which was more important than economic growth or anything else.\nEven though, within the first wave of the pandemic, we all had to physically distance ourselves from each other, a strong solidarity emerged which brought us closer together, both internationally, and within specific societies. We had the opportunity to witness numerous communities, in time when they themselves were fighting with this deadly pandemic, they had still provided assistance to others, those most vulnerable; they did not allow themselves to turn only inward and lock themselves down.\nOn behalf of Bosnia and Herzegovina I would like to thank all the friends who have come to our aid; who did not let us be alone during our most difficult moments.\nAlthough we do not have great resources at our disposal, we have also tried to respond to all appeals for aid.\nJust like any other great misfortune, this one has also reminded us how much we are directed one to another, and how important it is to have friends.\nWe particularly appreciate the fact that Bosnia and Herzegovina, although not an EU member state, has been included in the EU public procurement system. I would like to use this opportunity to point out that the vaccine against the coronavirus must be available to the entire mankind.\nDear President,\nThere is an indisputable fact that during the past few years, a very strong crisis of multilateralism has been present at the scene. International organizations in general, including the very United Nations, have become an object of strong challenging and even dispute.\nAllow me to share with you an observation how multilateral organizations, even at the time of the pandemic, have shown their extraordinary significance in today\u2019s globalized world, which is based on interdependence and a necessity for constant cooperation. The pandemic has shown that the largest problems of today can no longer be solved by one, three, or five states individually. These difficulties can only be solved through transnational, multilateral response, based on dialogue and cooperation of as many states as possible.\nWe were particularly able to witness this on the European continent, where a historic agreement for a package of economic recovery of the European Union worth over two trillion Euros, has indicated how the European unity is extremely strong and can serve as an example to all other parts of the world.\nThe strength of the European Union has also been demonstrated in the fact that it did not direct its enormous financial resources to only serve its own needs, rather it has also supported other countries, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, a country that is on its road towards the membership in the European Union.\nBosnia and Herzegovina would also like to use this opportunity to express its gratitude towards the European Union for the strong support received for its economy and the health care system, which has had an extraordinary stabilization potential.\nThe EU assistance package for Bosnia and Herzegovina, worth 300 million Euros in total, for purposes of resolution of the economic consequences of the pandemic, has most certainly additionally strengthened our commitment to the European integration, and, at the same time, it has secured, for the very European Union, the stability in its nearest neighborhood.\nDear President,\nThe end of this year will mark the 25 years since the signing of the Dayton Peace Accord, which has stopped the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the moment when it was signed, this Accord seemed very frail and untenable, yet it has proven to be a very strong and resilient stabilization framework that has managed to resist numerous challenges.\nThe main problem of the Dayton Peace Accord is in the fact that some of its parts had not been implemented at all, while some have only been implemented partially. Annex IV, or the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, presupposed the full implementation of the entire Accord. This deficiency will have to be remedied. Dayton Peace Accord must be fully implemented; all decisions of the international courts must be respected and equal rights for all citizens must be secured in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights. This particularly pertains to expelled persons that have returned to the places they resided in before the war.\nFor the past twenty-five years Bosnia and Herzegovina has been living in peace, which is of irreplaceable significance having in mind our experience of the 1990s, as well as the experience of the numerous crisis areas which have emerged throughout the world.\nWhen we are talking about the shortcomings the Dayton Peace Accord, we should never forget that this is a peace accord, whose primary goal was not to secure the implementation of sophisticated constitutional standards, and it is quite natural that it requires an update which is only possible through a wide political consensus.\nIt is of high significance that all relevant political subjects in our country are deeply aware of the facts that the foundations of the Dayton Peace Accord can only be changed through a wide consensus and agreement of all.\nOf course, this situation means that there can be no quick and simple changes, and, therefore, there can be no quick and simple progress that many expect and demand. At the same time, this situation guarantees to all in Bosnia Herzegovina, that they have a significant level of security and protection.\nThere is a general consensus in Bosnia Herzegovina about the irreplaceable significance of preserving peace, and thus, the Peace Accord on which it is based upon. This gives hope that in the future, the society of Bosnia and Herzegovina will be increasingly more preoccupied with issues of development, as it enters in a new phase of its historic road.\nDear President,\nBosnia and Herzegovina shares the concern of the UN General Assembly due to unresolved conflicts in the current crisis areas.\nWe offer full support to the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019s call for global ceasefire, after the escalation of the coronavirus pandemic.\nEven though, recently, there has been a decrease of violence in Syria, we are quite aware of the fact that the conflict continues in sporadic forms, and are particularly concerned with an extremely difficult humanitarian situation of the internally displaced persons in Syria.\nWe are concerned because no progress was achieved in ending the conflict in Libya, Yemen and Ukraine, and, therefore, we are calling for a more intense involvement of bodies of international community in order to achieve a permanent end of conflicts.\nBosnia and Herzegovina believes how securing permanent peace and stability in relations between Israel and Palestine can only be achieved through diplomatic efforts, within the framework of international law, and, therefore, we offer our full support to such efforts.\nBosnia and Herzegovina supports the dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade led under the auspices of the European Union and the United States of America.\nDear President,\nBosnia and Herzegovina is a serious, reliable and a resolute partner in strengthening the European security area; we actively contribute to regional efforts with the goal of strengthening stability and security of the Western Balkans.\nOur country is constantly strengthening its capacities to combat terrorism, all forms of violent extremism, international crime, manufacturing and trafficking narcotics. Bosnia and Herzegovina participates in regional and international initiatives that contribute to international security, and in the past period, we made a complete turn from a country that had required international assistance in the sense of military missions, and became a country whose soldiers and police officers partake in peace missions throughout out the world.\nWe have good cooperation with neighboring countries on numerous issues, and we have placed the issue of relationships with our neighbors at the very top our foreign policy priorities. Our goal is to resolve open issues with our neighbors through dialogue, based on the principles of mutual respect and reciprocity and with full respect of international law.\nIn that respect I wish to convey the concerns of the citizens of Bosnia Herzegovina, due to the fact that some important issues, such as the issue of Agreements on State Border, have not been resolved with all of the neighboring countries. Bosnia and Herzegovina has signed the Agreement on State Border with Montenegro, yet, until today, no such agreement has been signed with Serbia or Croatia. Bosnia and Herzegovina believes that these agreements need to be concluded as soon as possible, with full respect of internationally recognized borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina and with full support and consistent implementation of the international law.\nSince the last quarter of 2017, Bosnia Herzegovina has been facing an enormous problem of illegal migrations, which has significantly worsened during this year. Due to the closing of the remaining migration routes, the majority of migrants who come from the Far and Middle East are heading towards the countries of the European Union through the territory of Bosnia Herzegovina, and they pose an enormous security and humanitarian problem, and our county does not have enough resources to solve it.\nOur plan is to additionally strengthen the competent institutions, dealing with this issue, to protect the border, and increase assistance to local communities that suffer the greatest burden of the crisis. In order to fully resolve this issue, we need a much greater support of the European Union, as well as cooperation with the countries the migrants originate from.\nThe migrants have no intention of staying in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Their goal is to go towards the Western Europe. They enter the Western Balkan region, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, from the European Union, and then, at the western border of Bosnia Herzegovina, a barrier is placed before them and they unnecessarily linger in Bosnia Herzegovina, which represents an enormous problem for us.\nOn the one hand, Bosnia and Herzegovina is not the final destination for migrants, and it is facing this problem solely due to its geographic proximity to the European Union as the entry point for migrants. On the other hand, Bosnia and Herzegovina understands its position within the international community and the European security area very responsibly, but we also need a stronger support from the very European Union, as well as the entire international community.\nFurthermore, we are trying to sign the appropriate readmission agreements with the countries the migrants originate from. With some of the countries we have managed to achieve an agreement, and we use this opportunity to call upon other countries, whose citizens are now in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to join us in this process.\nA serious social problem in Bosnia Herzegovina is the emigration of the young and educated people. As they struggle with their own democratic deficit, the developed countries of the European Union are attracting young and educated people from Bosnia and Herzegovina by offering them significantly more favorable jobs and the overall existential opportunities in their well-regulated systems.\nThe only way for us to efficiently fight this trend, is to build a society which will be based on the principles of equal opportunities, political stability and legal security, where it is possible for young people to plan their future.\nWe are slowly, but persistently, approaching this goal thanks to a particularly credible perspective of the EU membership. In that regard, we have started to implement the obligations from the Opinion of the European Commission regarding the application of Bosnia and Herzegovina for EU membership, and we are expecting the competent institutions to fulfill the entire set of obligations as soon as possible in the upcoming period.\nFurthermore, it is equally important to continue fulfilling the obligations Bosnia Herzegovina has with regard to relations with NATO, by unreservedly endorsing all laws and decisions adopted by the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina on this issue.\nDespite of the difficulties in functioning, Bosnia Herzegovina is slowly making progress, and our ultimate commitment remains to be the building of a safe, stable and prosperous state, which will, as an equal member of the international community, contribute to safety and prosperity of the global community.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "In the Holy name of Allah, The Most Gracious, The Most Merciful\nYour Excellency Mr. Volkan Bozkir President of the United Nations\u2019 General Assembly,\nYour Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres UN Secretary General,\nYour Highnesses, Excellencies, Heads of delegations, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nAssalamu Alaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh.\nFirstly, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate Your Excellency on your election as president of the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly, and to affirm our full support in any which way that might facilitate your tasks and the full implementation of the responsibilities that rest on your shoulders.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation for the outstanding efforts and great skill and professionalism of your predecessor His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande during his presidency of the previous session.\nMr. President,\nThe 75th session comes at a compelling and unprecedented time fraught with danger which has relentlessly beset all aspects of modern life, crossing borders without restrictions, loudly resonating disease and death, not recognizing geographical borders, dismissing the various ethnic, political and social determinants that were formed and shaped by historical experiences of mankind.\nThe suffering that COVID-19 has incurred on human life has been accompanied by the woes of those who have lost loved ones and have raised their voices in prayer to spare the afflicted. Hence, we convey our deepest sympathy and heartfelt condolences to the peoples and countries of the world for this great loss. We pray to the Almighty, who praised the patient in hardship and misfortune, that His mercy enshrines the souls of the deceased, speeds up the recovery of the infected and relieve humanity of this calamity.\nMr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nThe severe impact of the pandemic on various basic and vital domains and aspects of daily life is alarming, it consequently resulted in the terrifying upsurge in the number of victims between 960,000 deaths, and over 30 million registered cases, in addition to the deepest recessions recorded hitting the world since the aftermath of the second world war, which was accompanied by the most widespread cases of revenues collapse since 1870, and the increased risk of more than 100 million people falling into abject poverty; all this has revealed to the world the importance of bolstering the economic, health, social and environmental systems in place, in a way that the inevitability of multilateral action has been put to the test; viable sustainability and continuity or shutdown and stagnation.\nIn this regard, we highly value the extraordinary and significant roles undertaken by the United Nations and its Secretary General Mr. Antonio Guterres by harnessing all means and measures in order to address this pandemic through accelerating action to provide vaccines, diagnostic tools and treatment for everyone everywhere, with special consideration and top priority given to those groups most affected and most vulnerable such as women, children and the elderly. Countries and societies that suffer from humanitarian crises and refugee crises as a result of armed conflicts, have not been absent from the conscience of this long-standing organization, having called upon its Secretary General to silence the guns and suppress the cannons. On 23 March 2020 he launched an appeal for a ceasefire around the world, describing it as an opportune occasion to overcome the causes of conflict, and to make room for tireless efforts to stop the malady of war and close ranks in order to fight the global battle against this pandemic, while concentrating on recovery from its destructive effects, as well as striving to focus on the stages of recovery from its devastating impact and build a more equal world through which the much sought after integration between education and employment are achieved. Sustainable development, social protection based on improving comprehensive health systems and strengthening the role of women and gender equality in rights and opportunities, all lead to the main purposes for which the United Nations was founded; that is to say preserving international peace and security and sparing future generations from the scourge of war.\nMr. President,\nIn light of the continued suffering that the world is experiencing to tackle the repercussions of COVID-19, and the overwhelming state of anticipation for the announcement of an awaited solution be it a certified vaccine or approved treatment that would lift the world out of this international crisis and stop the deluge of deterioration, restoring hope to people by resuming their usual way of life and dispelling the feelings of panic and trepidation that have consumed them at the outset of the year. All this gives cause for thought at the state of many regions around the world; this pandemic has contributed to widening the scope of the crises they endure, and has increased the challenges burdening its peoples, which unfortunately our Arab and Middle East region bare the brunt of, despite the availability of written solutions and described therapeutic methods epitomized in the abundant amount of international references constituting the resolutions and outputs of the Security Council and the General Assembly. However, the long-standing challenge inherent in implementation and serious tackling of its provisions has remained an insurmountable obstacle to moving forward and achieving the desired progress.\nThe State of Kuwait, in assuming its responsibilities by supporting the efforts of the International community to fight this pandemic has contributed 290 million dollars, stressing its commitment to cooperate in support of international efforts to accelerate the process of manufacturing the vaccine and making it available in a fair way for countries most in need. In addition, it has announced its readiness to host critical cases of UN personnel infected with the COVID-19 virus while working in the field in Central and West Asia, to receive medical care in Kuwaiti hospitals.\nMr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen\nThe Palestinian cause still occupies a central historical and pivotal position in our Arab and Islamic worlds. We stress our principled and firm position in supporting the choices of the Palestinian people to obtain their legitimate rights, as well as the importance of continuing efforts to re-launch negotiations within a specific timeline to reach a just and comprehensive peace according to the terms of reference of the peace process, international legitimacy resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative; ending the Israeli occupation and establishing an independent Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital on pre-4 June 1967 borders. We value, in this context, all international efforts to resolve this pivotal issue.\nMr. President,\nThe ongoing crisis in brotherly Yemen, and the serious threats it poses to regional security and stability indicates the reality of how relevant Security Council resolutions and outputs are being handled, with the importance of adhering to the implementation of the Stockholm Agreement. In this respect, we firmly reassert our position that the political solution is the only solution to this crisis based on the three terms of reference agreed upon; the Gulf Initiative and its executive mechanism, the outcomes of the Yemeni National Dialogue Conference and Security Council resolutions mainly resolution 2216 (2015). We reemphasize our support for all efforts made by the the Secretary General\u2019s Special Envoy of to Yemen aimed at resuming the political process in order to reach a political solution that could bring an end to this crisis. We call on all parties to respond positively and agree to the proposals put forward. At the same time, we welcome the constructive roles played by the brotherly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to initialize the implementation of the Riyadh Agreement, while we renew our condemnation of all attacks on Saudi territories, reaffirming our support for all measures taken by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to preserve its security and stability. We also urge for rapid action to be taken to tackle the oil tanker \u201cSafer\u201d to avert an imminent environmental catastrophe.\nThe developments of the Syrian crisis, which has entered its tenth year, with all the human suffering it sustains, stand as true witness to the loss of international consensus and the increased foreign interference that was a major reason for prolonging this bloody conflict. We appreciate the small body of the constitutional committee resuming its work and convening its third round of talks in Geneva at the end of last August, and look forward to it continuing its work towards realizing the hopes and aspirations of the brotherly Syrian people by reaching a political settlement in accordance with the relevant security council resolutions, specifically resolution 2254 (2015) and the 2012 Geneva (1) Communique, stressing our firm position that there is no military solution to resolve this tragedy other than sitting at the negotiation table, which is the only way to bring an end to the humanitarian plight, we call upon all parties to engage positivity in these negotiations and we value the tireless efforts exerted by the UN Secretary-General\u2019s Special Envoy to Syria.\nMr. President,\nAnother issue of concern to us in our Arab region is Libya\u2019s continued state of severe constitutional division for over six years, whose critical indications have aggravated the security and stability of the country and region. We urge all Libyan parties to exercise restraint and allow peaceful solutions based on dialogue to take precedence over violence. In this context, we welcome the positive results achieved during the dialogue sessions between the delegations of the parliament and the supreme council of state through reaching an continued understanding towards drawing up a roadmap to unify the state\u2019s sovereign institutions in accordance with Security Council resolutions, including resolution 2510 (2020), and the related outcomes of regional and international conferences.\nWe laud the constructive role of the brotherly Kingdom of Morocco in hosting these recent sessions, hoping that these efforts will lead to a comprehensive political settlement that guarantees security, stability and unity of Libya and meets the aspirations of its brotherly people.\nMr. President,\nFrom the principled premises of consolidating rules of good neighborliness set out in the United Nations charter, we re-appeal to the Islamic Republic of Iran to take serious measures towards confidence building to commence dialogue built on respect for the sovereignty of states, non- interference in their internal affairs and to ease tension in the Gulf and preserve the safety of maritime navigation. This will contribute to building relations based on cooperation and mutual respect reflecting the future aspirations of all countries in the region for a life of security and stability bringing about prosperity and development for their peoples. We also call on Iran to cooperate with the International community to ease tensions and escalation in the region.\nMr. President,\nTerrorism and violent extremism are amongst the most menacing and dangerous challenges that threaten the world order at its core, as the Middle East region in particular, has suffered from an upsurge in subversive operations executed by terrorist organizations predominantly, known as Daesh, which has taken Islam as a cover for its destructive intentions. It has been a direct reason calling for the importance of intensifying efforts to combat this real threat in all forms and manifestations, and working to dry up its sources, eradicate its funding resources and activate international and regional agreements concerned with countering terrorism.\nIn light of the exacerbating events witnessed by many countries in our region of the devastating threat in Yemen, Libya, Syria, Somalia and Afghanistan, Iraq\u2019s experience has been recorded as the most cataclysmic as a result of the crimes committed by Da\u2019esh, which owing to the great role of the international community through the cooperation between the Security Council and the Iraqi government had a tangible impact on clearing Iraqi territory from that terrorist entity. We emphasize the importance of continued support of the efforts of the Iraqi government for reconstruction and enforcing stability on all its territories. In this context, we also express our satisfaction with the results of the Afghani peace talks, that the sisterly State of Qatar commendably hosted, we praise its role and efforts in this regard, and convey our appreciation for the responsible spirit shown by the participating Afghan parties to achieve the desired peace and security.\nMr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nThe adoption of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development goals, which is in its fifth year, illustrates the most lofty human plan striving for a better future, which came as an extended complementary effort for the success achieved under the Millennium Development Goals, in a way that humankind was the main focus of formulating its foundations and drawing its desired results, presenting itself as an opportunity to remind that the fulfillment of international obligations and solidarity at the global level will represent the real starting point for accomplishing those goals aimed at eradicating poverty in its various forms and ensuring all human beings obtain their equal rights in dignity, education, health, political participation, youth and women empowerment, and addressing the impact of climate change within the framework of the Paris Agreement, describing the continuation of environmental degradation as one of the biggest obstacles to realizing those goals, according to the principle of shared responsibility, taking into account the difference in responsibilities and burden bearing.\nAlthough the United Nations announced in January 2020 that the current decade will be ushered to become a decade for expediting the implementation of the plan, however the effects and repercussions of this pandemic is of comprehensive scope, rendering this approach difficult to uphold in a way that it becomes necessary to preserve the progress made in the field of development. Sustainable development depends on the inevitability of activating multilateral international action and raising global cooperation and solidarity according to the rule of common destiny, by restoring balance in financial and trade systems and effectively providing vital global public goods, guided by sustainability standards in taking decisions while bearing in mind the circumstances and conditions in developing countries.\nFinally, I can only renew our adherence to multilateralism and to the principles and objectives of the United Nations Charter to ensure the development and strengthening of international governance and guarantee the fulfillment of its noble mission of maintaining international peace and security and serving all humanity.\nWassalamu Alaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh."

        "file_text": "Your Excellency, Volkan Bozkir, President of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly,\nYour Excellencies, Heads of State and Government,\nYour Excellency Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nMr. President,\nI wish to extend warm congratulations to you and the people of the Republic of Turkey, on your election as President of the 75th session of the General Assembly. I assure you of Namibia\u2019s support and cooperation during your tenure as President of the General Assembly. I express great appreciation to your predecessor, His Excellency, Professor Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, son of Africa, for his outstanding stewardship of the work of our organisation, particularly during a very difficult and trying period. I am also privilidged to express my admiration and appreciation for the performance of our Secretary General during this challenging period the world is facing.\nThe 75th Anniversary\u2019s theme \u2014 \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism - confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action\u201d \u2014 reminds us of our shared humanity and the reality of an interconnected world. As we face the COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating effects, we should reaffirm our collective commitment to cooperate in a world governed by international law and a multilateral system in which no one should feel left out.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has altered the trajectories of our socio-economic livelihoods, and our interactions with one another. While not perfect, multilateralism and rules-based order are essential tools in strengthening governance, protecting civil liberties and the fundamental rights of the people we serve in our respective countries. An effective, rules-based multilateral system is our insurance policy against existential threats such as wars, nuclear proliferation, pandemics and climate change. It is therefore of utmost importance that we continue to defend multilateralism at all cost.\nMr. President,\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into an acute health and economic crisis, the severity of which has not been seen in a century. It has disproportionately affected some countries more than others, exposing and exacerbating vulnerabilities and inequalities within and among countries. The adverse socio-economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, compounding existing challenges such as high debt burdens, reduced fiscal revenues, capital outflows, and lack of adequate and sufficient access to financial markets, does not bode well for the future of developing countries. This is due to the fact that the unfolding crisis could halt or reverse gains in poverty eradication, food security and inequality. It is why this health emergency should lead to an even deeper sense of urgency and impactful multilateral solidarity. The world needs it more than ever before.\nIn this respect, we commend the UN Secretary-General, H.E Antonio Guterres, for the launch of the $2 billion multi-partner Trust Fund for COVID-19 Response and Recovery. While we also acknowledge the debt relief initiatives announced by the IMF, the World Bank and the G20, I encourage all our partners to facilitate their emergency lending mechanisms and accelerate technical support to even so-called Higher Middle Income Countries such as Namibia. This is vital to ensure access to social protection and basic services, sustainable economic activity, and protection of jobs and incomes.\nMr. President,\nNamibia commends the World Health Organisation for all its targeted efforts in fighting COVID-19, including the global development of a vaccine. This vaccine, once developed, should become a global public good, accessible to all, freely and equitably. Namibia stands ready to partner in such development for the benefit of our citizens and the world at large.\nEnvironmental degradation is a persistent and growing problem and, quite literally, a deadly threat to the security of our peoples. The COVID-19 pandemic has diverted resources from Climate Change and related mitigation efforts. The people of Namibia continue to suffer major environmental disasters such as floods, drought and water scarcity. We therefore should ensure that we rededicate ourselves to commitments of the Paris Agreement. As a member of the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy, Namibia reaffirms its commitment towards tackling the great challenges that the world\u2019s oceans face, ranging from global warming, ocean acidification, marine pollution, including plastic pollution, and unsustainable exploitation of its living marine resources. We commend the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Norway, Her Excellency Erna Solberg, for developing this outstanding initiative and look forward to working with Norway and the other members of the Panel, to address these challenges.\nMr. President,\nWhen I addressed this august Assembly one year ago, as a member of the African Union Committee of 10 on the Reform of the United Nations Security Council, I expressed my desire to see the marking of the 75th anniversary of the United Nations as an opportunity to conclude the reform of the United Nations Security Council. Namibia reiterates that the African continent wishes to see a reformed Council, which is reflective of its Common African Position as outlined in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. I take this opportunity to welcome and thank those who have expressed support for the Common African Position. As we prepare to mark the 20th anniversary of resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security \u2014 a resolution which was adopted under the Namibian Presidency of the Security Council in October 2000 \u2014 we must celebrate the achievements thus far, while also recognizing that many challenges still remain. I look forward to the opening of the International Women\u2019s Peace Centre in Namibia next month. The Peace Centre is intended to become an institute of excellence for mediation and conflict prevention to support and ensure that women are given adequate tools to contribute to humanity\u2019s future.\nMr. President,\nThe 17 interconnected Sustainable Development Goals and their promise to leave no one behind by 2030, ring hollow for the peoples of Palestine and Western Sahara, who still remain under occupation. They are left behind. As a nation that has experienced the outpouring of international solidarity during the dark days of our struggle for independence, we wish to express our continued support for the right to self-determination and freedom of the peoples of Palestine and of Western Sahara. We also hope that the search for the UN Secretary-General Special Envoy for Western Sahara will be concluded very soon. Furthermore, we express our support for a settlement that will bring a just, lasting and comprehensive peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Despite the political and diplomatic setbacks, in particular continued threats of annexation of Palestinian territory, we remain hopeful for a fair and comprehensive peace solution that will guarantee the rights of all Palestinian peoples and ensure their return to their homes, while safeguarding peace and security to the Israeli people as well.\nAs the world combats the COVID-19 pandemic, some Member States face more obstacles in combating this virus than others, including those which have sanctions imposed on them. In support of the pursuit of economic development, unity and prosperity for the sister country of Zimbabwe, I once again call on the lifting of sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe. President Emmerson Mnangagwa has been pursuing reforms that will enable the people of Zimbabwe to get on a path of sustainable development and peace. Therefore, the continued sanctions undermine these efforts to develop the people of Zimbabwe.\nMr. President,\nNamibia reiterates her deep concern over the continuation of the extraterritorial economic, financial and commercial embargo imposed on the people of Cuba. We continue to express our support for the Government and people of Cuba and call for the unconditional lifting of the embargo, and for respect of the sovereignty of Cuba. In the spirit of creating a more just, peaceful and caring world in which we foster peaceful and harmonious coexistence amongst all nations, Namibia looks forward to the day when relations between the United States of America and Cuba will be restored fully.\nFor the past 75 years, the United Nations has distinguished itself as a champion for equality and unity. At this critical time, when we are faced with a multitude of challenges that threaten our future, we look upon this great organisation to once again, provide the definitive answers to our problems. Therefore, let us embrace one another and pull together in the spirit of multilateralism, in the interest of defeating Covid-19, in the interest of achieving the SDGs and in the interest of safeguarding global peace and the human dignity of every man, woman and child in the world.\nI thank you."

        "file_text": "In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful\nAll praise belongs to the Almighty God and peace and blessing upon His prophet and his household and companions\nMr. President\nI am delighted to congratulate you, as the representative of our fraternal neighbor, Turkey, on your well-deserved election as the President of the Seventy-Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly. Allow me to wish every success for you, the honorable Secretary General and all your colleagues in your efforts to realize the goals and objectives of the United Nations.\nExcellencies\nThe people of the world, having taken God-given blessings of health and security for-granted, were suddenly shaken by the outbreak of COVID-19. In spite of its tiny size, COVID-19 managed to challenge global management and national governance so seriously that the world\u2019s most significant assembly is convening virtually through videoconference.\nCOVID-19 is now a \u201ccommon pain\u201d for humanity \u2014 thanks to the rapid growth of science, technology and the media. This common pain has demonstrated that despite all progress, our ignorance as humans far outweighs our knowledge. COVID-19 is calling us to more humility and humbleness before the Almighty and the Truth of Creation. It is guiding human societies towards civil piety in promoting social and individual ethics as well as preventing environmental degradation and manipulation of nature and unhindered interference in the Creation. This universal plague that has crossed over the fabricated boundaries of power and wealth reminds us, once again as members of human society, that it would be impossible to confront common global issues without global participation.\nAll of us across the globe are experiencing difficult times during the pandemic. However, my nation, the resilient people of Iran, instead of enjoying global partnership and cooperation, is grappling with the harshest sanctions in history imposed in blatant and gross violation of the Charter of the United Nations, international agreements and Security Council Resolution 2231 (2015).\nThe footage broadcast to the world concerning the treatment of an African American by the U.S. police is reminiscent of our own experience. We instantly recognize the feet kneeling on the neck as the feet of arrogance on the neck of independent nations. For decades, the valiant Iranian nation has paid a similar high price for its quest for freedom and liberation from domination and despotism. However, the Iranian nation has not only resisted the pressure, but flourished and advanced while persistently pursuing its historical and civilizational role as the axis of peace and stability, the harbinger of dialog and tolerance and the champion of the fight against occupation and extremism:\n\u2022\t We stood with the people of Afghanistan against Soviet occupiers, domestic warlords, extremists, Al-Qaeda terrorists and American occupiers. And we played a pivotal role in all peace and reconciliation processes, be it the 2001 Bonn Conference or regional initiatives.\n\u2022\tIn the Mid 1980\u2019s, we called for collective security arrangements in the Persian Gulf, even as all global and regional powers were backing Saddam Hussein\u2019s \u201ctanker war\u201d. In 2013, we proposed World Against Violence and Extremism (WAVE), which was unanimously adopted by this Assembly. In 2018, we offered a nonaggression pact to our neighbors and in 2019 we presented HOPE (Hormuz Peace Endeavor) to this General Assembly in an effort to enhance peace and stability in the Persian Gulf.\n\u2022\tWe were the first country in the region to stand with the people and government of Kuwait against occupation by Saddam; and it was Iran that foiled his dream of dominating all his former Arab allies.\n\u2022\tWe stood with the people of Iraq against Saddam tyranny, U.S. occupation and Daesh savagery. We supported all Iraqis \u2014 whether Kurd or Arab, Sunni or Shia, Yazidi or Christian \u2014 and supported democratic achievements of Iraqi people from the Governing Council in 2003 to all elected governments since.\n\u2022\tWe stood alongside the people of Syria against tens of terrorist Takfiri groups, separatists and foreign fighters. We presented our four-point peace plan\u2014 centered on self-determination by the Syrian people \u2014 in 2013 when others were seeking a military solution. In 2016, we formed the Astana process \u2014 in partnership with Russia and Turkey \u2014 aimed at achieving peace and political stability in Syria.\n\u2022\tWe stood with the people and government of Lebanon against Zionist occupiers, domestic warmongers and foreign plotters.\n\u2022\tWe never ignored occupation, genocide, forced displacement and racism in Palestine and we never made a deal over the Holy Quds and the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people. And in 2012, we presented a democratic solution through referendum in Palestine.\n\u2022\tWe vociferously called for justice against aggression for the besieged people of Yemen and presented a four-point peace plan at the outset of hostilities in 2015.\n\u2022\tWe fought alone against extremists and Daesh terrorists \u2014 who claimed to be fighting for Islam \u2014 in this sensitive region of the world; so that the international community would recognize the true face of Islam: the moderate and rational Islam; and not extremism and demagoguery. Our assassinated hero, Martyred General Soleimani, was the champion of the fight against violent extremism in the Middle East and fought to protect all citizens of this region \u2014 religious or secular, Muslim or Christian, Shia or Sunni \u2014 against medieval reactionaries.\n\u2022\tAnd in 2015, we achieved the JCPOA as one of the biggest accomplishments of the history of diplomacy and remained faithful to it in spite of persistent violations by the United States.\nMr. President\nSuch a nation does not deserve sanctions. The response to peace is not war. The reward for combatting extremism is not assassination. The reaction to the choice of people through the ballot box in Iran, Iraq and Lebanon is not outside agitation and support for non-democratic processes and street riots.\nWords and claims are not our yardstick. Actions are:\n\u2022 They claimed they came to our region to fight Saddam Hussein\u2014the very monster they had themselves created, nurtured, and financed in his imposed war against Iran, equipping him with chemical weapons and the most sophisticated war machine.\n\u2022\tThey boast to be fighting terrorism and Daesh, while it is, they themselves, who created this terror network. And they have the audacity to expect regional gratitude for such behavior.\n\u2022\tThey accuse us \u2014 without any foundation \u2014 of trying to build nuclear weapons, and they impose sanctions on others under the pretext of nuclear proliferation. This is while they have the infamy of being the sole user of atomic bombs in the history of humanity; and while the only possessor of nuclear weapons in West Asia is running their non-proliferation theatre.\n\u2022\tThey speak of human rights, while they have targeted \u2014 through their \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d \u2014 heath, welfare and even the right to life of all Iranians.\n\u2022\tThey are directly involved \u2014 along with their regional accomplices \u2014 in every single case of occupation, war, and aggression \u2014 be it in Palestine, Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Sudan, or Somalia. Yet they blame Iran for their own inevitable defeats in confronting the will of the people of the region.\n\u2022\tThey have sold hundreds of billions of dollars of weapons to their clients turning our region into a powder keg. Yet, they try in vain to deprive Iran of its minimum defense requirements, and disregard international law and global consensus in order to extend arms restrictions against Iran in contravention of the letter of UNSCR 2231.\nHere, I should express our appreciation to the presidents of the Security Council for the months of August and September 2020, as well as to thirteen of its members \u2014 especially Russia and China \u2014 who twice said a decisive and resounding \u201cNO\u201d to the unlawful US attempt to exploit the Council and its Resolution 2231 (2015).\nThis is a victory not just for Iran, but for the global community \u2014 during the transitional international order in the post-Western world \u2014 that an aspirant of hegemony is humiliated in such self-created isolation.\nLadies and Gentlemen\nWhere can you find precedent for a government to renege, without any reason, on the outcome of 13 years of multilateral talks \u2014 also attended by its predecessor, shamelessly violate a resolution of the Security Council and even punish others for abiding by a UNSC resolution? And simultaneously claim to be seeking negotiations and a \u201cbig deal\u201d?\nThe United States can impose neither negotiations, nor war on us.\nLife is hard under sanctions. However, harder, is life without independence.\nPolitical freedom at home is important. We\u2014as the oldest democracy in the Middle East\u2014are proud of our people determining their destiny and will not trade domestic freedom with foreign interference.\nDemocracy is the sovereign right of a nation, and not the right of interference by an outsider \u2014 let alone a terrorist and interventionist outsider that remains captive to the illusions of 19 August 1953, when its predecessors overthrew the only democracy in the Middle East through a coup d\u2019etat.\nDignity and prosperity of our nation are essential for us; and they are attained through diplomacy relying on national will coupled with resilience.\nWe are not a bargaining chip in U.S. elections and domestic policy.\nAny U.S. administration after the upcoming elections will have no choice but to surrender to the resilience of the Iranian nation.\nAnd for the world: Today is the time to say \u201cno\u201d to bullying and arrogance. The era of dominance and hegemony is long over. Our nations and children deserve a better and safer world based on the rule of law.\nNow is the time for the right choice.\nI thank you for your attention."

We all acknowledge the UN\u2019s vital contribution to the development of our societies, as well as its galvanizing role by fostering dialogue, cooperation and shared responsibility, on the basis of the universal values and principles enshrined in the UN Charter. These principles are just as relevant today as they were 75 years ago.\nRomania remains a firm supporter of the multilateral rules-based international order, with the UN at its core. Romania is committed to cooperate for a safer future for all, by promoting sustainable development, respect for human rights, peace and security. This is the future we want!\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated, once more, that global challenges require common action, solidarity and cooperation. We must show commitment to \u201ca quantum leap in collective engagement\u201d, as mentioned by the Secretary-General. Multilateralism is also essential in harnessing opportunities to build back better and greener, towards inclusive and sustainable economies, and societies where \u201eno one is left behind\u201d. In order to achieve that, we must continue reforming the UN, to make it more effective, efficient and fit for its purpose. That is the United Nations we need!\nYour Excellencies,\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on all areas of our lives. The UN\u2019s comprehensive response to this crisis highlights the interdependence of the economic, humanitarian, security and human rights pillars. Nonetheless, it has revealed the imperative need to deal with them in a holistic way.\nThe pandemic has prompted increasing divisions across the world, as well as attempts to weaken democracy. However, this period as facilitated the spread of disinformation and misleading information, which can be possible vectors for the spread of violence and extremism.\nIt is therefore the pivotal moment to transform this crisis into a new opportunity and to revitalize the security and peace agenda, with a strong emphasis on conflict prevention and the consolidation of peace processes. Our efforts in the context of peace operations must continue with ever greater efficiency. We also support greater integration of the principle of the responsibility to protect into actions and projects focused on prevention.\nRomania traditionally contributes to world peace and security. We have participated in UN peace operations around the world, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to South Sudan, Mali and Kosovo, and we will continue to play our role.\nWe are convinced that cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations is an essential instrument in consolidating security and development in the world. We are always concerned about the multitude of unresolved conflicts in the Black Sea region, which affect stability and cooperation in our neighbourhood. We continue to promote cooperation between the United Nations and various organizations in our region, including as the current Chairman of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation.\nWe support regional and international efforts to combat terrorism, in accordance with human rights and humanitarian law, as well as the forthcoming review of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.\nRomania remains firmly committed to maintaining a rules-based international order and consolidating the global architecture for arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament, while taking into account the security context. As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the entry into force of the NPT (Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons) in 2020, Romania encourages all parties to take a forward- looking approach, doing everything possible to achieve compromise to strengthen the integrity of the NPT in all its pillars.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nWhile hunger, youth unemployment and gender inequality are on the rise, more action is needed in order to fully implement the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. In line with the Secretary General\u2019s call, we have the responsibility to address these challenges globally and locally. We have to set adequate policies, budgets, institutions and regulatory frameworks. We also need to involve and listen to our fellow citizens, in order to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. In Romania, a dedicated strategic document launched in 2018 \u2014 The 2030 Reviewed National Strategy \u2014 guides our action over the next 12 years in order to meet the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.\nDuring the Decade of Action for the SDGs, we must also work together to protect our planet and ecosystems. We need to resort to a rational use of planetary resources when pursuing economic growth, in full respect for biodiversity. The Biodiversity Summit offers a unique opportunity to show ambition and accelerate action on biodiversity for sustainable development.\nFirm action is also needed in order to tackle the climate and environmental emergencies. From rising sea levels to catastrophic weather events, we can no longer afford to ignore the risks of climate change. We all have a duty to the future generations to turn Glasgow COP26 into a success and to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.\nThe EU Green Deal is a token of our commitment in that regard and an example of good practice, but we, the European states and institutions, cannot succeed by ourselves. We must all do our part to achieve a just, clean, secure and climate-sound future.\nRomania\u2019s objective by 2050 is to create a framework where the economic, social and environmental policies are interconnected and designed to ensure: sustainable development, high living standards and the quality of the environment.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nThe future we want is one in which human rights are promoted, protected and fulfilled. We must ensure inclusivity and accountability and harness the youth and civil society\u2019s engagement.\nThe leaving no one behind principle should also be valid for human rights, taking into account that the overwhelming majority of the SDGs are anchored in human rights instruments.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is also taking its toll on human rights, deepening pre existing inequalities and enhancing vulnerabilities. We must ensure that a comprehensive and consistent approach to human rights is at the core of all efforts for economic recovery.\nGender equality is central to all the Sustainable Development Goals. This year marks the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and its Platform for Action. Together, they define the most comprehensive and transformative global agenda for gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. The future Generation Equality Forum should achieve tangible results on gender equality. We must stand together for women\u2019s rights! Gender equality and women\u2019s rights are essential to recovering faster and better from this pandemic.\nDigital Technology is central to almost every aspect of the response to the pandemic and a prerequisite for the achievement of the SDGs. The development and use of Digital technologies, including Artificial Intelligence, based on ethical principles, must be human-centred. The promotion and protection of human rights, democracy, good governance, accountability and the rule of law must be provided offline and online. Thus we need a universal political commitment to digital security. The UN should galvanize the digital cooperation at global level and contribute to mobilizing all actors to ensure open, secure and affordable access to digital infrastructure for all.\nThe digital sector in Romania amounts to 6 per cent of the GDP and is an important driver of growth and innovation. We see digitalization as an opportunity for everyone and a key component of our economic development. Romania\u2019s digital transformation aims to make our country less bureaucratic, more resilient, and more attractive for foreign investment. It also has the potential to turn Romania into a regional innovation hub.\nThe COVID-19 crisis has proven that disinformation and hostile actions in the information environment are threatening both international and human security, and they have to be effectively addressed. This crisis demonstrated the crucial need for access to reliable, accurate and science-based information. Thus, it has confirmed the role of free, independent, accountable and pluralistic media in strengthening transparency, accountability and trust.\nThe future we want is also a future of solidarity, in line with 2030 Agenda and the principle of leaving no one behind. One of the main lessons we have learned during the past months is the crucial need for effective and innovative multilateral cooperation. We have also learned that the rules-based international order \u2014 on which multilateralism relies on \u2014 must be upheld and strengthened, in order to effectively address these challenges.\nNow, more than ever, we have acknowledged that health represents an investment in the future and is key to sustainable development. Our intensified efforts to achieving the SDGs will contribute largely to mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 crisis.\nRomania has therefore become part of \u201cThe Coronavirus Global Response\u201d pledging initiative. At the same time, we have re-oriented several projects this year towards responding to health emergencies, particularly in our Eastern Neighbourhood and in Sub-Saharan Africa. Romania has redirected more than half of its budget for international development cooperation to respond to COVID-19. We contribute to consolidating the institutional capacity of health systems, ensuring food security and sustainable water management, as well as countering fake news in the COVID-19 context.\nRomania has included the refugees in the national public health coverage and is ensuring their access to all the necessary medical facilities. All persons who have received the refugee status or another form of international protection have been granted continued access to the national territory. This process continued even during the state of emergency caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, and these persons are included in the prevention programmes against COVID-19.\nRomania pays particular attention to youth, especially as far as education and professional training are concerned. As such, we have more than doubled the number of scholarships offered to foreign citizens for the 2020-2021 academic year, with particular attention to Africa. We believe that by ensuring the continuity in youth training, we contribute to the materialization of the \u201cbuild back better\u201d principle.\nIn its current capacity as Presidency of the Community of Democracies, Romania has actively promoted the role of youth in democratic processes. The Bucharest Declaration, adopted at the 20th anniversary of the Community of Democracies hosted by my country in June this year, clearly states that\n\u201cdemocracies are best equipped to mobilize and ensure that all elements of\nsociety work together, adapt to new circumstances, and maximize inclusive\njoint efforts, including full and meaningful participation of youth in\ndecision-making\u201d.\nFollowing, the CoD Youth Forum organized by Romania this July has confirmed that as democracies need to work together to deliver the best results, youth involvement is essential for our common future and for the welfare of our societies.\nExcellencies,\nIn conclusion, the UN we need must ensure effective multilateralism and mobilize all stakeholders, governments, financial and business sectors, academia and civil society. In order to find sustainable solutions to current global challenges, we must hear all voices in our society, women and girls, youth and children, as well as people in vulnerable situations.\nThe future we want must meet our aspirations to peace, freedom and justice, equality and prosperity, good health and a clean environment \u2014 a future in which human rights, democracy and the rule of law provide us with an adequate framework to achieve our aspirations.\nI take this opportunity to mention that Romania itself is celebrating 65 years since joining the UN. In this context, I would like to reaffirm our commitment to the universal values of our Organization and our resolve to continue to contribute to achieve its noble objectives.\nMr. President of the General Assembly,\nI congratulate you on the important responsibilities you have assumed and assure you of Romania\u2019s full support and cooperation during the 75th session of the General Assembly.\nThank you for your attention !"

        "file_text": "Honorable President of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly\nHonorable Secretary-General of the United Nations\nHonorable Heads of State and Government\nHonorable Delegates\nLadies and Gentlemen\nYour Excellencies\nI would like to begin my remarks by congratulating Mr. VOLKAN BOZKIR for his election as President of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, and offer him our full support during his term in office, which we wish to be full of successes.\nIndeed, his election reflects the recognition, among the Member States of our Organization, of the role that his country has played in the international arena and his extensive experience. We are certain that this will greatly contribute to the success of this Session\u2019s work, and will allow him to identify better paths toward the resolution of the major issues facing the International Community.\nWe would also like to express our gratitude to Professor TIJJANI MUHAMMAD BANDE and congratulate for the wisdom and dedication with which he conducted the work of the 74th Session.\nFinally, we could not fail to express our appreciation to Mr. Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, for the competence, selflessness, and zeal with which he has led our organization.\nMr. President,\nThe theme chosen for the 75th Session of the General Assembly is pertinent to the current moment that we are experiencing in our world. We are convinced that Multilateralism is the best way for us to combine our efforts and together mitigate the effects of the economic and financial crisis that the COVID-19 Pandemic has imposed on the world.\nWe do believe that multilateralism will allow us to overcome the enormous challenges facing the world. Indeed, the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 PANDEMIC that is ravaging the world has shown us that a combination of efforts and international solidarity can help us mitigate its nefarious and worldwide impacts.\nWe must not lose sight of the unceasing struggle against poverty. In our view, this is the greatest scourge on humanity, and that it is the main cause of famine, soil degradation, unbridled exploitation of natural resources, armed conflicts, population displacements, South-North migratory flows and its continuing toll in human lives.\nTherefore, we take the privilege of this opportunity to reaffirm our support for renewed multilateral cooperation on behalf of the people we serve, and for more multilateralism, more solidarity, and more effectiveness in both the combat against the effects of poverty and the maintenance of international peace and security, which is an indispensable condition for inclusive and sustainable development.\nIn this regard, we unfortunately continue to see persistent tension spots with major humanitarian repercussions all over the planet.\nPolitical and military conflicts persist in the Central African Republic, the Eastern Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, Libya, the Sahel, with emerging terrorist groups, and the actions of the terrorist groups El Chebab in East Africa and BOKO HARAM in Central and West Africa.\nWe are concerned and apprehensive with respect to the flare-ups of violence in the Mozambican Province of Cabo Delgado, and call for greater International Community involvement in the fight against the tragic terrorist actions in that region of Mozambique.\nThe perennial issue of Western Sahara continues to be a cause of concern for us and demands greater involvement from all of us in the search for a permanent solution in this prolonged negotiation process. Therefore, we reiterate our call for the involved parties to resume negotiations and reach a mutually acceptable political resolution.\nIn addition, the situation in the Middle East also continues to cause concern in us, in light of the constant hostility between Israel and Palestine, as well as the situation in Syria and Yemen. Therefore, we must find a compromise that will put an end to hostilities and pave the way for open dialog and negotiation toward a political solution that establishes lasting peace in that region of the world.\nThe economic, trade, and financial embargo imposed on Cuba many years ago continues to be, in our view, another cause of major concern. For this reason, Sao Tome & Principe reiterates our call for these sanctions to be lifted in order to allow Cuba to face the challenges of economic and social development without the constraints imposed by unfair sanctions and take better advantage of opportunities in trade relations on an equal footing with the other Member States of our Organization.\nThe persistence of violent extremism must continue to receive our attention but not to the detriment of other equally important challenges to human existence, which are reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals, such as combating poverty, climate change, and sea piracy, among others.\nMr. President,\nHonorable Heads of State and Government\nOur planet is profoundly distressed by the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the new coronavirus, with incalculable consequences both for our health and in social and economic terms.\nIn light of the high mortality level and devastating effects of this disease, and its high rate of spread, we must continue to use the mechanisms that multilateralism offers us in terms of international solidarity, in order to intensify the combat against the disease, deter the loss of human lives, and relaunch the economic development process in our countries.\nWe take this opportunity to express our appreciation for the wave of bilateral and multilateral solidarity that has benefited Sao Tome & Principe, which has allowed us to escape a potential disaster. We offer our sincere and profound gratitude to the International Community.\nHowever, in light of the devastating effects of the COVID-19 PANDEMIC on the economies of fragile countries, such as Sao Tome & Principe, a Small Island State, we renew our call for a continued spirit of solidarity and support for a post- COVID-19 economic recovery, which is likely to be very challenging.\nMr. President,\nMr. Secretary-General,\nIt seems indisputable to us that the reason for the existence of the United Nations is the Maintenance of Peace and Security in the world, which is essential to foster development.\nWe should note, however, that the world has changed significantly since the creation of our Organization in 1945, and that we urgently need to adapt it to the new challenges of our time.\nTherefore, we once again reiterate our call for the reform process underway at the United Nations to be accelerated in order to give it greater momentum and increase its representation, effectiveness, capacity, and legitimacy in actions that lead to the maintenance of international peace and security and thus drive development throughout the world.\nMr. President\nHeads of State and Government\nMr. Secretary-General\nSao Tome & Principe is preparing to graduate to the category of medium- income country in December 2024, a fact of which we are proud, as it reflects a recognition of the efforts that our country has undertaken and the progress achieved in key areas of sustainable development.\nHowever, we are aware of the internal efforts that will be required for us to overcome the enormous challenges that we will face after this graduation. Therefore, we strongly appeal for the International Community\u2019s continued support in this new stage of our country\u2019s development.\nMr. President\nHonorable Delegates\nYour Excellencies,\nIn closing, we would like to express our wishes that the world may see better days after this 75th Session of our august General Assembly, with peace and security, and progress toward the sustainable development that our countries long for.\nThank you very much for your attention."

        "file_text": "Your Excellency Mr. Volkan Bozkir \u2014 President of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly;\nYour Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres \u2014 United Nations Secretary-General;\nExcellencies Heads of State and Government; Ladies and Gentlemen.\nAt the outset, I wish to extend my congratulations to Your Excellency, Mr. Volkan Bozkir, on your election to the Office of President of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. You can count on my support and that of the people and Government of the Republic of Malawi during your tenure.\nTo the outgoing President of the United Nations General Assembly, Your Excellency Tijjani Muhammad-Bande: Thank you for your hard work and leadership throughout your term of office.\nOn a sombre note, I convey to you all my nation\u2019s sincere condolences to all of you for loved ones lost to the COVID-19 pandemic, as will as good will to those recovering from the virus.\nMr. President,\nAs you know, I took office as President of the Republic of Malawi following my election on June 23 of this year, making this my inaugural address to this Assembly, which is a great honour. The process leading to that election, though protracted, was peaceful and a clear justification of Malawi\u2019s reputation as a beacon of democracy, anchored in respect for human rights, governance institutions, and the rule of law. The smooth transition of power between me and my predecessor has fostered a peaceful environment and sustained our billing as the Warm Heart of Africa, which I have since vowed to govern by servant leadership and a philosophy called \u201cTonse\u201d, meaning \u201call of us\u201d.\nMr. President, Excellencies,\nI address the Assembly at the height of the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, which is ravaging health systems across the globe and causing deep economic harm to our nations. Malawi, being a member of both the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDC) Groups, is among the hardest hit, a situation compounded by a skewed development trajectory.\nOur challenges are more exacerbated by geographical and related disadvantages such as lack of territorial access to the sea, isolation and remoteness from world markets, and high transit and transport costs. All these impose constraints on our trade competitiveness and overall socio-economic development and inhibit our full participation in global production networks and supply chains.\nIn this regard and as Chair of LDCs, Malawi issued a Statement on 25 April, 2020, which highlighted the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in terms of: high risk of debt default; worsening trade competitiveness; supply chain disruptions; and a constrained informal working sector. The Statement further appealed for enhanced international support towards the LDCs.\nWith regard to the high risk of debt default, we acknowledge the World Bank Group, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and many key development partners for the debt moratorium granted to the LDCs. Considering the potential length and breadth of this pandemic, we request and are hopeful for debt cancellation ultimately and an extension of the debt moratorium in the meantime. That will enable us as LDCs to recover from this devastating pandemic sustainably.\nOn trade, we appeal for deliberate measures to ease supply chain disruptions. As you are aware, Malawi and many LDCs have large informal sectors, which play crucial roles in domestic resource mobilization through remittances and small scale economic production.\nWe, therefore, welcome efforts to reduce transaction costs on remittances and implementation of rescue and turnaround packages for small scale enterprises.\nI wish to confirm our commitment to host the postponed Africa Regional Review Meeting of the LDCs planned for 2021. As Chair, I would also like to take this opportunity to invite all LDC Member States, the private sector, civil society organizations, UN Agencies, Friends of the LDCs, and all other stakeholders, to the LDC-V Conference scheduled to take place in January, 2022, in Doha, Qatar. This will be a great opportunity for us to prepare our next 10-Year Plan of Action for LDCs, and we thank the State of Qatar for accepting to host this important event.\nMr. President, Excellencies,\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agenda remains a pragmatic platform for coordinated international development among Member States, especially now, when we are facing the threat of COVID-19 pandemic and strained international cooperation and multilateralism. However, Malawi is optimistic towards the achievement of the SDGs.\nIn our case, achieving the SDGs is the best opportunity of addressing socioeconomic challenges in pursuit of the vision of inclusive wealth creation and self- reliance. Accordingly, as we enter the decade of action, which is the last ten years of the implementation of the agenda 2030, my Government continues to work with the United Nations system and other development partners in all priority areas of SDG acceleration. Malawi is focussed on implementing those SDGs with multiplier effects on others in order to maximize scarce resources and stakeholder participation, more so, in a COVID-19 Pandemic situation.\nWe are proud to have undertaken the first ever Voluntary National Review (VNR) during this year\u2019s High-Level Political Forum in July, 2020. The review noted our remarkable progress towards SDGs implementation albeit the myriad outstanding challenges. We, therefore, appeal for enhanced implementation support from our partners.\nMr. President, Excellencies,\nWe are conscious of the critical importance of policy domestication in attaining the SDGs. Malawi integrated the SDGs into its national development planning framework, the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS III). Realizing the need for enabling effective institutions, Malawi established the National Planning Commission that is charged with domesticating SDGs through national development plans. We are also implementing public sector reforms, which are championed at a high level in the Office of the Vice President of the Republic of Malawi.\nIn order to break the cycle of food and nutrition insecurity and chronic vulnerability to climate change and disasters, my Administration is implementing the National Resilience Strategy for the period 2018-2030. The strategy bridges development and humanitarian interventions and prioritizes a continuum of more predictable livelihood support packages targeting the most vulnerable households so that our development process leaves no one behind.\nMr. President, Excellencies,\nWe take note of the UN reform efforts as championed by the Secretary General and reiterate the crucial role of ONE UN in ensuring efficient and effective delivery for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\nHowever, we are concerned with the status of the UN Security Council reforms. Malawi, therefore, reiterates the call for urgency in advancing these reforms with full representation of Africa in line with the Ezulwini Consensus of the African Union. For the avoidance of doubt, we call for two Permanent Seats with Veto Power and five Non-Permanent Seats for Africa.\nWe need a UN that fully meets Africa\u2019s needs in peace processes, which can only be achieved if Africa is involved in making such decisions. In view of the incessant conflicts that are currently tearing down the African continent and retarding its progress, the reforms are long overdue.\nMr. President, Excellencies,\nGlobal challenges and opportunities are reminders that we are all interconnected. The COVID-19 pandemic and climate change, among others, are such colossal challenges that require global unity and solutions. The commemoration of the 75th Anniversary of the UN is it itself an opportunity to celebrate our collective achievements and the Charter on which our unity is founded. We must work together as one global family.\nWe must collectively do all we can to save lives and ease the economic and social devastation. Crucially, we need to draw the appropriate lessons from the global vulnerabilities and inequalities exposed by the virus and mobilize sustainable investments in education, health systems, social protection and resilience.\nHowever, multilateralism is not only a matter of confronting shared threats; it is also about seizing common opportunities. We must seize this moment and emerge stronger, better, and more inclusive. The virtues of multilateralism must not just be preached; they must be practiced. This calls for the participation of all stakeholders in shaping the future, especially the youth, who are the majority in our nations.\nMr. President, Excellencies,\nAt this key moment for international cooperation, and during the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations, unity is paramount towards the realisation of our shared vision of a healthy, equitable, peaceful and a more sustainable world.\nMalawi values partnerships in achieving common goals. It is for this reason that we accepted the responsibility of chairing the LDC Group up to 2022; and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) from August, 2021. Our membership in the African Union Peace and Security Council up to 2022 is premised on the same calling. Malawi is committed to make its humble contribution in all UN efforts including in the UN Human Rights Council, where we are seeking membership in 2021.\nIn keeping with the adage, \u201ccharity begins at home\u201d, we are committed to continue contributing a battalion of the Malawi Defence Force to the UN Peacekeeping Mission under a SADC Force Intervention Brigade in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.\nYou can count on our humble contribution towards the UN fit for purpose in the 21st Century.\nI Thank You for Your Attention,\nMay God Bless Us All."

        "file_text": "President of the General Assembly,\nHeads of State and Government and Heads of Delegation,\nSecretary-General of the United Nations,\nDistinguished delegates,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nHis Excellency Mr. Patrice Talon, President of the Republic of Benin, Head of State and Head of Government, who could not be here today, has instructed me to deliver the following address on his behalf.\n\u201cFirst of all, I would like to reiterate to you, Mr. Volkan Bozkir, my warm and sincere congratulations on your election as President of this august Assembly and assure you of Benin\u2019s full support and cooperation as you conduct your duties.\nI take this opportunity to express Benin\u2019s gratitude to Mr. Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, and to reiterate my support and that of my Government.\nAt a time when the entire world faces the COVID-19 pandemic, I take this opportunity to offer my sincere condolences to all nations that have recorded deaths and express the solidarity of the Republic of Benin with those affected by this scourge.\nAs all States mobilize to deal effectively with this health crisis, my country welcomes the fact that the United Nations and its specialized agencies, in particular the World Health Organization, consider it a priority.\nBenin welcomes the theme of this year\u2019s session, which is entitled, \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism \u2014 confronting COVID-19 through effective multilateral action\u201d.\nThis theme forces us to shoulder our responsibilities and reiterate our faith in and commitment to multilateralism and the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations. It reminds us of the urgency of collective action to find appropriate and lasting solutions to the challenges of our time, the most pressing of which is, as you know, the eradication of COVID-19.\nWith the support of all its people and of the international community, Benin will continue its efforts to grapple with this pandemic and its consequences and, in particular, to revitalize its economy which, like the economies of the majority of countries, is deeply affected by this scourge.\nTo that end, among other things, my Government has rolled out a vast programme that amounts to nearly 200 billion CFA francs to support formal and informal businesses alike, as well as artisans and vulnerable people.\nI would like to express my Government\u2019s gratitude to the United Nations, its Member States and all international organizations for the considerable assistance provided to developing countries in general and to Benin, in particular, in the design and implementation of strategies to respond to the pandemic. Thanks to our combined efforts, the spread of the virus has been limited in my country, which has meant that Benin\u2019s rate of spread and death rates are low.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most serious public health crises in modern history. This threat should not lead us to ignore the fight against HIV/AIDS and other diseases that pose a threat to our communities.\nEffectively combating this scourge requires, just as managing all of today\u2019s global challenges, a coordinated international response and enhanced cooperation on a global scale.\nThat is why Benin, through my voice, reiterates its commitment to promoting and strengthening multilateralism, as the only framework for cooperation among States seeking to resolve contemporary issues of all kinds, including the fight against extreme poverty, which is a priority.\nLadies and gentlemen,\nLet me remind you that in September 2016, during the general debate of the seventy-first session of the United Nations General Assembly, I stressed that mass poverty is a major threat to humankind and that we must take proactive collective action to eradicate it. Four years later, this call remains relevant.\nI reiterate the need for the urgent implementation of a global programme to overcome this form of poverty through collective and voluntary action. Multilateralism, which enabled the United Nations to provide the world with the Paris Climate Agreement, should be the right tool for achieving this objective.\nIn this regard, I welcome the courageous reforms undertaken by the United Nations Secretary-General to reposition the UnitedNations development system. Benin supported resolution 72/279, aimed at strengthening the institutional architecture of the United Nations development system to ensure its greater effectiveness.\nBenin also firmly supports the intergovernmental negotiations on the reform of the United Nations Security Council. We believe that this reform will make it possible to redress the historical injustice done to Africa \u2014 the only continent not represented in the Council as a permanent member. Benin also reaffirms, through my voice, the urgency of allocating two permanent member seats to Africa, in accordance with the Ezulwini Consensus.\nMr. President,\nHeads of Government and Heads of Delegations,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nPeace and harmony among States is a key component of Benin\u2019s foreign policy.\nMy country therefore reaffirms its support for diplomatic initiatives aimed at creating a viable and fully sovereign Palestinian State, living side by side and in peace with the State of Israel.\nBenin believes that the current context of COVID-19 should justify concrete steps for the total and definitive lifting of the embargo on Cuba. However, in spite of the pandemic, regrettably, we see that the embargo is being tightened.\nMy country again makes an urgent appeal for the normalization of relations between Cuba and the United States of America, in the interest of the people of both countries and of the entire world.\nMr. President,\nSince April 2016, Benin has been engaged in far-reaching political and economic reforms designed to clean up its economy, create a favourable environment for investment and combat corruption and prevarication.\nBenin has therefore decided to break with the mistakes of the past and seek to engage in rigorous and resolute governance in all sectors. My Government systematically implements major reforms through its Action Programme, whose goals are in line with the SDGs.\nThe results achieved, which have been lauded nationally and internationally, have convinced the people of Benin that, with determination and resolve, it is possible for countries to get out of the rut and return to the path of development and prosperity.\n\u201cMy Government is relentlessly pursuing its path towards the radical transformation of living conditions in Benin\u2019s cities and rural areas, including universal access to drinking water and electric power, which, as recently as 2016, was considered a privilege and a luxury in Benin.\n\u201cMy Government\u2019s programme of action also attaches prime importance to preserving the environment and the energy transition. The measures planned within that framework are complementary to the objectives and priorities contained in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\n\u201cThe appeal I launched on 15 November 2016 in Marrakech at the Conference of States Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was aimed at creating an international research centre to address the effects of climate change on agriculture, received a favourable response from States.\n\u201cI take this opportunity to commend the States and regional groups, along with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change secretariat, who are sparing no effort to reach the consensus necessary for the effective establishment of the centre.\n\u201cMr. President,\n\u201cLadies and Gentlemen Heads of Government and heads of delegations,\n\u201cLadies and Gentlemen,\n\u201cBenin belongs to a subregion increasingly affected by the deteriorating security situation. Unfortunately, the number of victims of terrorist violence continues to grow, particularly in the Sahel. The situation requires joint efforts and collective actions to address it.\n\u201cIn that connection, I welcome the action plan for 2020-2024 adopted in December 2019 by ECOWAS with a view to effectively and comprehensively combating that scourge in the West African subregion.\n\u201cFurthermore, I would like to express Benin\u2019s solidarity with the G-5 Sahel member countries and call on the international community to bolster regional efforts by providing strengthened support in the fight against terrorism in Africa.\n\u201cThere is no doubt that, together, we will succeed in stabilizing those regions of Africa with a view to creating conditions conducive to their development and the fulfilment of the aspirations of their respective populations.\n\u201cThank you for your kind attention.\u201d"

        "file_text": "Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nIt seems rarely a year goes by where the international order is not declared in crisis. These calls have swelled to a justifiable new crescendo this year with the multilateral order experiencing perhaps its gravest crisis since its origins seventy- five years ago.\nToday, we leaders assemble through extraordinary means under extraordinary circumstances, with the legitimate question of whether this Assembly, has seen its best days or if by reason of the strength of our actions and convictions, we may endure to overcome today\u2019s incredible challenges.\nMr. President,\nSaint Lucia looks forward to your wise and capable stewardship during this unprecedented 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly. We thank Professor Muhammed-Bande for his very able and astute leadership over the course of the last year. More than ever the world needs effective leadership and Saint Lucia is committed to working with the United Nations toward our common goals.\nThis year, possibly more than any point in our modern history, this Assembly is beset by global risks and threats that force us to consider deeply, the future we want and the United Nations we all need. This year\u2019s theme calls for the reaffirmation of our collective commitment to multilateralism, for us to continue to confront COVID-19 through effective multilateral action.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its dire consequences on world economies, financial markets and social and humanitarian destabilisation, have been emphasized by every leader who has come before me. However, it is worth restating that our current crisis demands urgent action.\nSmall Island Developing States, like Saint Lucia, have always been inherently susceptible to environmental, economic and financial shocks. Our unique circumstances and consequent vulnerabilities have left us exposed to the ravages of the twin crises of the pandemic and climate change. Every day, as leaders of SIDS, we struggle to safeguard our people from the pervasive erosion of our hard-fought developmental gains.\nAs the global community contends with the devastating impact of the pandemic, we must be honest with ourselves and acknowledge that the current challenges of SIDS is a symptom of a broader problem: the failure of our international institutions to keep pace with, and adapt to, the practical reality faced by SIDS.\nWe must acknowledge that the global economic architecture, created post Second World War, never considered Small Island Developing States. And despite the empathy and the understanding of the technocrats at the International Monetary\n6/62\n21-00395\n13/01/2021\nA/75/592/Add.9\nFund, the World Bank and our own Caribbean Development Bank, as well as other IFIs, they remain constrained by their own inflexible governance structures.\nFor decades now, SIDS have been extremely vocal in highlighting the fact that this system has produced some of the most incredible paradoxes for our nations. They include the fact that:\n\u00a5\tSIDS are the most indebted, yet we are the least likely to get debt relief or concessional financing.\n\u00a5\tSIDS are the smallest producers of global goods and services, yet we are the most restricted by the rules of international trade.\n\u00a5\tSIDS are the lowest contributors to terrorist financing or banking impropriety, yet we are the most constrained; placed on grey lists and black lists posted all over the world, undermining our reputations.\n\u00a5\tSIDS are the smallest emitters of carbon, yet we are the most affected by climate change.\nMr. President, let me point out that all of these paradoxes are man made. As I have often said the solution to many of these problems simply requires the stroke of a pen. Our aspirations to build back better and advance our work to continue implementing the Sustainable Development Goals, are extremely bleak within the current international context. For years we have argued our case: the financial crisis, climate change, and the latest pandemic have provided the empirical evidence that reaffirmed the vulnerabilities of SIDS and inadequacy of the solutions in the current global architecture.\nIn recent years SIDS, backed by academic research have advocated for the establishment and use of a vulnerability index, already developed by the Commonwealth in 1989, as a more accurate determinant of eligibility for concessional development assistance. Yet nothing has changed. Our wealth is still being determined by per capita GDP, though we know now categorically that this is not an accurate measure. At meeting upon meeting, all we receive are platitudes and more talk. Meanwhile, the storms and hurricanes, the crises and the pandemics, keep coming regardless.\nWe are disproportionally asked to carry the burden of major shocks which are caused by actions outside of our control. With every additional shock we become more indebted and dependent and it will soon become impossible for us to survive within these fixed rules that are created without taking into account our exceptional circumstances. Unfortunately, the same obtains with the issue of Climate Change. For the SIDS, the Paris Agreement, though well intended, has just not delivered.\nWe understand that the world is changing and as noble of an ideal of eliminating poverty is, we must have greater aspirations of at least a minimum standard of living for all. I have said before and it is worth repeating: if a family is struggling to survive, if a mother does not know where her children\u2019s next meal is coming from, if parents don\u2019t have a means to put a roof over their family\u2019s head, how are they going to participate, or even care about the SDG Goals?\nWe cannot continue to attend meetings to discuss solutions within the current framework. We must first agree that the global economic development architecture has to change. New forms of measurement and criteria must be adopted that are going to allow SIDS the opportunity to help ourselves.\nAll we are asking for is a fair chance.\nUnless, the \u201cnew normal\u201d was always just a cliche? Or does it actually mean something? If we agree and accept that there is a new normal, then the criteria used before cannot apply. We are at a crossroads, a pivotal moment for a meaningful course correction. We must choose the difficult and uncomfortable road to finally re-engineer the international system, to enable and ensure fair, inclusive and relevant policies and solutions for all; or we will continue down the path which inevitably leads to the demise of SIDS.\nMr. President,\nThere is much that must be done to meet the test of this moment. Seventy-five years ago, it was not beyond human ingenuity to overcome the great challenges of the time to give birth to multilateralism. To come together to solve problems and advance a common prosperity. The leaders of the day understood that humanity could not survive the course it was on, and so it built this united assembly, our United Nations \u2014 to allow us to strive to collaborate rather than divide, to resolve conflicts, enforce international rules of behaviour and build habits of cooperation that would grow stronger over time. Underpinning all of this were the key values of tolerance and mutual respect.\nThe United Nations and the other multilateral processes and institutions born of that time, have over the decades made a difference in the world. From brokering peace, to educating children and eradicating disease, while weathering crises from within and without. But it is the considered view of my delegation that international institutions require profound structural shifts. Our collective commitment to multilateralism has to not only advocate for multilateral rules, but vigorously pursue change where change is needed. Or, as we have done in my island, challenged ourselves to build a new Saint Lucia, we must equally rise to the challenge and build a new world economic order, which addresses the SIDS and regains the confidence of nation\u2019s in multilateralism.\nMr. President,\nAs we chart a new path forward as a global community it would be prudent to take with us the lessons learned when multilateralism and diplomacy have delivered a proven record of service to our people. Such cooperation and success cannot be taken for granted, particularly in our current difficult global context. Critical to these successes was the equal commitment of resources, a time when we were our brother and sister\u2019s keeper. I take this opportunity to applaud the United Nations Development System for their active response to the pandemic, for listening to the specific needs of states and mobilising resources where possible. The support of the UN system is critical for the effective implementation of not only the SDGs but the Samoa Pathway.\nI also wish to offer sincere gratitude and commendation to the countries who stepped up to the challenge, in the truest spirit of solidarity to assist states like my own, to cushion the pandemic\u2019s blow to our socio-economic landscape. This support has been immeasurable. Some of the countries who offered support and continue to do so, themselves are grappling with a multilateral order that systematically stymies their development prospects. It is time to lift the economic embargo on the government and people of Cuba. Not only has it affected the people of Cuba but it has also affected the entire Caribbean region.\nIt is time to, once again, give states like Taiwan recognition so that they can meaningfully engage in global processes and share their best practices. Even as China and Taiwan have their own differences and while this is being addressed, Climate Change and the COVID-19 pandemic are stark reminders that Taiwan should not be left out of the discussions. Taiwan has its own elections, its own currency, controls its own airspace and has its own military force. A population of almost 24 million people is too many to be left off the table.\nAs we mark 75 years, the continued exclusion of Taiwan, calls into question the very principles the UN was established on. We must also recognize that as the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic Taiwan has demonstrated impressive leadership, not just by their own success with managing the spread, but by coming to the aid of nations such as Saint Lucia and many other countries to provide medical resources and technical advice. The pandemic which has touched every country is a potent reminder of the interconnectedness of human societies and more reason why in building our new world economic order, we must leave no one behind, no people, no country should be allowed to fall through the cracks.\nSaint Lucia would never have done as well as we did with managing the pandemic without friends like the people of Taiwan and Cuba. As I speak today Saint Lucia has only recorded 27 cases with no deaths. We have reopened our country to visitors and we have learnt to co-exist with COVID-19. I am equally proud of the success record that many SIDS have had. Like many other nations we are thankful that despite their own difficulties Taiwan and Cuba have reached out to help the world.\nMr. President,\nThe Chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, emphasized in his remarks at the commemoration of the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations, that we SIDS do not have the luxury to retreat from loss and damage. Science projects that if left unchecked, the impacts of climate change will see SIDS begin to disappear within a generation. Whole nation states wiped off the face of the earth. As our chair affirmed, the plight of SIDS is the plight of the United Nations; the loss of any of our island states would signal a failure of the United Nations. No name plate in the General Assembly Hall should have to be turned off indefinitely, simply because we refused to collectively respond to the glaring warning signs.\nMr. President, in this 75th year of the United Nations, I wish to acknowledge the presence on the United Nations Security Council of St Vincent and the Grenadines \u2014 the smallest country to ever take up a seat on the council. As a strong and capable voice in one of the most powerful and influential global bodies; we applaud our island neighbour, for their continued advancement of multilateralism, small island state exceptionalism, and staunch advocacy of the fundamental principles of this organisation.\nI also wish to note that we are also marking the 15th anniversary of the World Summit where leaders supported the early reform of the Security Council. Due to the pandemic discussions on this issue have not taken place and Saint Lucia joins other countries in encouraging text-based negotiations so the reform efforts will be expedited.\nMr. President,\nThe founding of the United Nations itself is a testament to human progress. Our predecessors chose the hope of unity over the ease of division and made a promise to future generations that the dignity and equality of all human beings would be our common cause. The Charter of the United Nations points the way with its vision of people and countries living as good neighbours, upholding universal values and recognising our common future. The 75 year old principles of working together must endure, but the specifics must take account of our rapidly changing world. The question remains whether we possess the wisdom and the courage, as nation states and members of this international community to squarely meet those challenges; whether the United Nations can meet the tests of our time.\nWe need to rise to that challenge now. Time is against us.\nSaint Lucia and Small Island Developing States stand ready to join forces and commit to building a new world economic order. So, let\u2019s make it happen.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nMr. Secretary-General,\nDistinguished Delegates,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nI extend cordial greetings from the Government and people of Grenada, on whose behalf I am always honoured to address this noble institution and its distinguished members.\nMr. President,\nI join those before me in congratulating you on your election as president of this 75th session of the General Assembly. I am confident in your stewardship and assure you of my delegation\u2019s cooperation and support. Your presidency and leadership during these turbulent times require agility in navigating such waters.\nI also take this opportunity to commend your predecessor, Ambassador Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, for his able stewardship of the 74th General Assembly.\nI further wish to thank both you and Secretary-General Guterres for your leadership and willingness to serve as guardians of the spirit of our UN Charter.\nMr. President,\nGrenada recommits, unwaveringly, to the United Nations and its principles as outlined in the Charter. Our commitment, in national and international fora alike, to the norms of peace, equality, justice, and to human rights and multilateralism, is clear.\nLet us never forget that the raison d\u2019etre of this august body is essentially to solve the world\u2019s problems through multilateral efforts.\nThe growing challenges we now face as a global community,such as poverty, poor education and climate change, have been compounded by this dreaded pandemic, and, in turn, risk stymieing the progress made in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. This risk is more acute than most to Small Island Developing States, such as Grenada, given our unique vulnerabilities, including climate change impacts and high indebtedness.\nMr. President,\nThese are problems that cannot be solved by individual member states. Our efforts must be collective, focused and strategic, if we are to achieve meaningful progress for the future we want.\nIt goes without saying that we are at a time of immense challenges, but consequently equally, immense opportunities. The world is at the juncture where the old reality meets the genuine potential of a new world order \u2014 only if we can grab this moment through genuine multilateralism.\nAcross seas and continents, people have had to reconcile their pain, with the hope that is needed to survive and to thrive.\nThe United Nations we NEED is a United Nations that respects, promotes and encourages solidarity and joint action. The United Nations we NEED must promote equality and respect for all humanity. The United Nations we NEED must protect populations from the crippling effects of unilateral sanctions and other coercive measures. The United Nations we NEED must always keep at the forefront achieving sustainable development for all peoples.\nWhilst the values and goals of the Charter continue to be relevant today as they were 75 years ago, its commemoration provides us a singular opportunity to not only reflect on our achievements, but also on our shortcomings. Above all else, we must remain resolute in ensuring inclusivity in overcoming and addressing the great challenges we face and do so together.\nMr. President,\nOur Assembly is occurring in a global context, with continued and increasing anxiety occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic, social and political upheavals it has caused around the world.\nCOVID-19 and its adverse impact on the economy of small states, particularly small island developing states, and the achievement of the sustainable development goals cannot be overstated.\nIn Grenada, for example,we are dealing with the devastating impact of the pandemic. From projections for an eighth consecutive year of growth, Grenada is now facing the stark reality of negative growth, triggered largely by the significant impact on tourism, construction and education. This has resulted in a drastic decline in Government revenue.\nIn July, for instance, the combined revenue collection by Customs and Internal Revenue Division dropped by 53 per cent compared to that of 2019; a decline likely to be replicated across our main revenue generating departments over the next few months. A staggering figure for a small island developing and micro-state as Grenada.\nThe Government of Grenada is, therefore,utilizing its reserves and seek international help to finance any deficits and bring relief to its citizens, while continuing the fight against the deadly virus. Already, we have attracted funding from the International and Regional Financial Organizations and friendly governments. We continue to look at other sources for grant and soft loan financing, as well as explore options for debt relief.\nNotwithstanding these economic challenges, the Government established a COVID-19 Economic Support Secretariat, along with the relevant stakeholders,with the aim of providing relief measures to the sectors most affected.\nMoreover, seven Cabinet-approved sub-committees were established with assigned responsibility for each of the productive sectors of the economy, namely, Tourism and Citizenship by Investment (CBI); Construction (Private and Public); Education Services; Micro, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises; Agriculture and Fisheries; Wholesale & Retail Trade & Manufacturing; and E-Commerce/ Digitalization.\nMr. President,\nThe inescapable fact, however, remains that despite the best efforts of individual governments, like Grenada, this unprecedented global scourge has deep and lasting economic and social impacts on already vulnerable states. While Grenada has thus far been able to successfully combat the health crisis doing our part to stop the spread and preserve life, with a total of 24 cases and currently COVID-19-free, such success was and is only possible through concerted action and stringent measures, which further exacerbate our socioeconomic crisis.\nThere is, therefore, an urgent need for greater cooperation in combating this dreaded pandemic and this reputable body is best suited to meet this challenge. COVID-19 impacts us all and we must work together as the failure of one link in our global chain to fight this pandemic affects us all.\nMr. President,\nIn the spirit of multilateralism and inclusion, Grenada has always supported and continues to support General Assembly Resolution 70/5, which calls for an end to the economic, commercial, and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba.\nWe call for an end to the Embargo against the Cuban people and we ask for continued solidarity and support for the Government and people of Cuba.\nIn spite of all its challenges, the role Cuba has played globally in helping to fight this global pandemic must be noted and lauded. The country\u2019s doctors have been at the forefront of this battle in all regions of the world.\nGrenada wants to thank the Government and People of Cuba for the assistance in our own fight, as well as all the other nations which provided direct assistance in this regard.\nMr. President,\nThe United Nations membership must make Article 3 of the Charter a major priority in the next few years. Our founding fathers called for this body\n\u201cto achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion\u201d.\nWe must do all in our power to provide added economic opportunities for the developing world. I, therefore, call on the Economic and Social Council to actively pursue undertakings that could create an encouraging atmosphere for Member States to have the opportunity to raise the standard of living of its people particularly in this pandemic period.\nIn this current global environment, we must be ever conscious that inclusion in the process of the global economy is vital.\nFinally, I must recall Article 1 of the United Nations Charter which calls for the Organization \u201cto maintain international peace and security; and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to peace.\u201d.\nWe must be relentless in our pursuit of the purposes of this organization. Our challenge is to work towards the strengthening of multilateralism if we are to effectively address the global issues that threaten humanity.\nOur quest must be for economic opportunities for all states. And our goal should be for the peaceful coexistence of all peoples of the international community.\nIndeed, Mr. President, if we can achieve this, we will be well on our way to achieving the future we want.\nI thank you."

I also say a special \u201cthank you\u201d to all the public health institutions and organizations throughout the world that are working tirelessly to bring an end to this dangerous virus that has taken the lives of so many millions in such a short time.\nI now extend my deepest sympathy and condolences to the bereaved families of all those who lost their lives to this deadly disease. May their souls rest in Perfect Peace.\nYOUR EXCELLENCIES, DISTINGUISHED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\nI congratulate His Excellency Mr. Volkan Bozkir on his election as President of the Seventy-fifth (75th) Session of the United Nations General Assembly and assure him of Liberia\u2019s fullest support in the discharge of his commendable duty. We have no doubt, Mr. President, that you will lead this august body successfully and fulfill the expectations and the confidence reposed in you during these difficult times.\nPlease also allow me to congratulate your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, for the able manner in which he administered the affairs of the 74th Session of the General Assembly.\nLet me also commend His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, for his enthusiasm and personal dedication to the work of the United Nations; and for his foresight in devising innovative responses to the challenges of this deadly COVID-19 pandemic.\nMR. PRESIDENT, DISTINGUISHED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\nThe theme chosen for this year\u2019s General Debate, \u201cThe Future we Want, the UN We Need: Reaffirming our Collective Commitment to Multilateralism \u2014 Confronting Covid-19 through Effective Multilateral Action\u201d, could not be more appropriate, as the United Nations commemorates the Seventy-Fifty Anniversary of its founding amidst the ravishes of a global pandemic that has infected nearly Thirty Million of the citizens of most of its member states, and killed almost One Million persons globally in just over six months.\nOn behalf of the Government and People of Liberia, I extend warm appreciation to all member countries of the United Nations and to all international organizations for the global solidarity we have seen in the face of COVID-19.\nThe world has stood together. Rich countries and poor countries have all been affected and are working together to eradicate this scourge. COVID-19 has taught us that as countries, whether rich or poor, developed or undeveloped, we are all united by our common humanity. We must all rise above normal divisions to work for a better, fairer and more united world.\nYour Excellencies, Africa has been hit hard by the pandemic, although the continent has not seen the number of deaths and affected persons as has been the case in many advanced countries. We can only attribute this to the MERCY OF OUR ALMIGHTY GOD, who has made sure that predictions of massive numbers of deaths on the continent of Africa did not materialize.\nIn Liberia, we were able to build on our previous experience six years ago with the Ebola Viral Epidemic, and I am proud to say that the Government and its development partners have mounted a robust National Covid Response that seems to have contained COVID-19 for the time being.\nAs a result, only about 1,320 Liberians have been affected by COVID-19 to date, of which approximately 1,213 of these have fully recovered, with some 82 Liberians falling to the epidemic.\nI therefore want to extend special thanks to our bilateral and multilateral partners for the strong support Liberia received to deal with the COVID-19 emergency and help sustain the Liberian economy. The Government has now developed a Post-Covid Economic Recovery Plan that prioritizes short term actions and investments in key sectors such as agriculture and tourism, as a means of reducing the impact of COVID-19 but also providing the basis for economic recovery.\nYOUR EXCELLENCIES, DISTINGUISHED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\nWithout a doubt, the United Nations remains today as the most important forum for peace, conflict resolution, the prevention of war, and the settlement of disputes between nations of the world, as well as the premier international organization for serving the needs of all mankind through its various humanitarian agencies. Nevertheless, the world has changed considerably since it came into existence after the Second World War, and the configuration of powers which obtained when its Charter was first written and upon which its decision-making structures were based, has witnessed many significant transformations over these past Seventy-Five years.\nThere is therefore an urgent need to review, refocus and readjust the priorities of the United Nations so that it can become more relevant and more effective in meeting the challenges that are today presented by new global alliances and realities. In this regard, more attention has to be paid to inclusiveness of the most vulnerable in our societies, whose special needs require a new and different mind-set.\nAs part of this process of re-evaluation, the United Nations adopted in 2015 a set of 17 Global Goals to be met by 2030. These Sustainable Development Goals, as they are commonly called, are intended to serve as a roadmap for our collective efforts to bring peace and prosperity to all mankind.\nWe are already five years into the 15-year Agenda, and with only 10 years left, it is already clear that we will have to redouble our efforts and accelerate our actions in many areas if we are to attain any or all of these lofty goals by the end of this decade.\nDISTINGUISHED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\nMy Government has taken many measures since the 74th General Assembly to deal with the persistent socioeconomic problems that continue to beset our country.\nFor example, our closure of schools in order to contain the COVID pandemic have seen an unprecedented recent increase in rape and Sexual and Gender-based Violence perpetrated upon young women and girls who have had to stay at home.\nIn response to this epidemic within the pandemic, we recently convened a National Conference which involved all Sexual and Gender-based Violence stakeholders. This resulted in the validation of a comprehensive roadmap intended to mitigate the incidence of this menace in our society. Based on the recommendations that emanated from the roadmap, my Government has declared rape as a National Emergency, appointed a Special Prosecutor for rape, set up a Sex Offenders Registry, and established a National Security Task Force on Sexual and Gender Based Violence.\nOn the issue of ending Female Genital Mutilation, for the first time in our country, traditional leaders have agreed to take ownership for ending this harmful practice. This has resulted into a first-of-its-kind suspension of the activities of all traditional bush schools in Liberia, where this harmful practice is carried out.\nIn addition, we recently passed into law the Domestic Violence Act; a legal instrument that seeks to abolish all forms of violence meted out against women, children and men.\nAlso, to call attention to the persistence and prevalence of corruption in our society, a National Anti-Corruption Conference was recently held, which was attended by all stakeholders, in an attempt to find practical and lasting solutions to this age-old problem.\nEXCELLENCIES, DISTINGUISHED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\nWe believe that the maintenance of world peace and security is of paramount importance for global growth and development. Every nation without peace is fragile, and has an uncertain future. Therefore, as we chart a new course for shared prosperity, we must reaffirm our collective commitment to multilateralism. As we confront these new challenges, multilateralism, international cooperation, and global solidarity will become increasingly important in addressing the complex problems that we now have to solve.\nExcellencies, Distinguished Heads of States and Colleagues, we must all continue to work together as a global community to confront disease and epidemics, fight poverty and prevent wars. As a Founding Member of the United Nations, Liberia avails itself as a strong partner in meeting these global challenges.\nI thank you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nIt is with great pleasure that I take the floor today to contribute to this year\u2019s general debate on the theme: \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism\u201d.\nFirst of all, allow me to congratulate you and the other members of the Bureau on your election as president of the 75th session of the General Assembly.\nI would like to salute your predecessor, Ambassador Tijjani Muhammad-Bande of Nigeria, who efficiently led the work of the 74th session.\nI also take this opportunity to pay tribute to our Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, who works tirelessly to build a world of peace and justice, in an environment marked by multiple bouts of upheaval.\nFor the first time in its history, the high-level week is taking place without world leaders being physically present and the general debate is taking place by video teleconference. This technical feat compels us to work together to provide a coordinated response that will help curb this health crisis.\nHeads of State and Government,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nThe United Nations is celebrating its 75th anniversary \u2014 a respectable age. It was baptized in 1945 and has helped to unite the efforts of all Members to save future generations from the scourge of war, promote social progress and create better living conditions for all peoples.\nThe past 75 years have shown that the success of our Organization\u2019s mission depends on its ability to bring people together to meet the multiple challenges facing the world.\nExcellencies,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nWhether we like it or not, multilateralism is on our minds.\nNationalism can at times be appealing, but it must be acknowledged that the majority of today\u2019s problems are transnational in nature. There is no shortage of examples. I could cite among many others, global warming, migration, terrorism, trafficking of all kinds and so on, which can be combated only through international cooperation.\nFor more than seven decades, multilateralism has spared the world the tragedy of another world war. It has contributed to economic development and technological advances in various parts of the world.\nWhile the United Nations has played an important role in this process, it is clear that many conflicts and tensions remain. At the same time, as I mentioned earlier, new threats have emerged. Rising inequality is one of them.\nIn today\u2019s globalized world, Cameroon would like that special attention be paid to the manipulation of public opinion and, in particular to the spread of false information through social networks, which increasingly constitute genuine threats to peace.\nAbove and beyond declarations of good will, my country believes that attaining the Sustainable Development Goals also depends on how each member of the international community assumes its responsibilities. Despite its limited means, Cameroon strives to make progress in eradicating poverty, promoting the rule of law and improving the quality of education.\nBut it must be acknowledged that low-income countries still have a long way\nto go.\nExcellencies,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nSince its inception, our Organization has been committed to conflict management and peacekeeping. The increase in the number of peacekeeping operations is a poignant illustration. More than 70 United Nations peacekeeping missions are in operation to support peace processes through, among other things, disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and repatriation, ceasefire observation and the maintenance of law and order.\nThe growing collaboration between the United Nations and other multilateral bodies in these areas is a step towards advancing multilateralism. This is particularly the case of the African Union, with which joint missions have been deployed and whose example has inspired African missions.\nAs a troop contributor to United Nations peacekeeping operations, Cameroon has shown an ongoing commitment to the maintenance of international peace and security. Indeed, my country has continued to contribute to this multilateral effort. For decades, Cameroon has contributed troops to peacekeeping operations, such as MINUSTAH, MONUC, MINUSCA and MONUSCO, and can, I believe, be satisfied with them.\nExcellencies,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nThe maintenance of peace and security also requires the United Nations to address the issue of climate change once and for all, as it has an impact on security. Yet some deny it, despite the fact that the increase in natural disasters is a stark reminder. It is clear that climate change poses a serious threat to human life. That is why urgent measures must be taken to ensure the future of humankind and to acknowledge the right of humankind to live in a healthy environment.\nMr. President,\nExcellencies,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nBecause peace is not merely the absence of war, but also access to food and basic services, Cameroon would like greater attention to be paid to the issue of development. At a time when many developing countries, in Africa and elsewhere, combat poverty, it is important for the markets of developed countries to be more open to them. This openness would be a useful complement to the official aid and technical assistance that these countries receive from external sources.\nFor its part, Cameroon aims to build a society in which everyone\u2019s basic needs are met. This entails ensuring food security, eradicating poverty, combating discrimination and expanding access to health care. It is in this spirit that my country adopted its national poverty reduction strategy.\nHowever, these efforts by my country are being hindered by the actions of the extremist group Boko Haram in the northern part of Cameroon. A sociopolitical crisis has compounded those difficulties in the north-west and south-west regions of the country where armed groups are terrorizing the population. The Government\u2019s efforts to protect the population and restore normal living conditions in the areas concerned have begun to show signs of success. A gradual return to calm is expected.\nMy country\u2019s Government is determined to pursue its mission, based on the principles of the rule of law, human rights, and the eradication of all forms of discrimination, exploitation and injustice. In prioritizing the need for consensus, Cameroon has successfully led a major national dialogue to address, among other things, the root causes of the crisis in the north-west and south-west regions to respond appropriately. The discussions have led to the adoption of the law on decentralization, which includes, in particular, granting special status to the northwest and south-west regions and implementing a reconstruction and development plan for the regions.\nWhile Cameroon is making every effort to address the challenges threatening its stability and development, we must acknowledge that it is difficult for a country to face terrorism on its own. That is precisely why the international community must be called upon to collectively combat terrorism wherever it may be.\nMr. President,\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nAfter 75 years of evolving efforts to achieve multilateralism, racism persists, barriers preventing the free movement of people are once again being set up, and fear of the other, especially migrants, continues to persist \u2014 all of which call for genuine multilateralism.\nIt goes without saying that the revitalization of the General Assembly will have to be combined with the that of the Security Council, which has been under way for several years. With regard to that issue, Africa expects all its partners to show solidarity in allotting two permanent seats, with all attendant rights, and two non-permanent seats to redress a historical injustice \u2014 an arrangement on which everyone seems to agree today.\nThe successful conclusion of negotiations on those two reforms would be the best anniversary gift that we the Member States could offer to the UN and all humankind, for whom our Organization remains the most appropriate forum for promoting peace, security and social progress.\nI thank you for your attention."

        "file_text": "Mr. President Excellencies the Heads of State and Government, Mr. Secretary General,\nDistinguished delegates:\nI extend warm greetings to you all from Nepal, the land of Gautam Buddha and Sagarmatha, also known as the Mount Everest.\nI join with other leaders in expressing our profound grief and agony on the loss of lives around the world due to COVID-19, including in my own country.\nI congratulate you, Mr. President, and other members of the Bureau on your election and assure you of Nepal\u2019s full support.\nThe outgoing President deserves our appreciation for successfully steering the 74th Session of the Assembly.\nWe commend the Secretary General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, for his tireless efforts to enable the UN deliver at this difficult time.\nMr. President,\nWe are passing through an extraordinary time. The COVID-19 pandemic is confronting us as a crisis of epic proportion.\nBe it the magnitude of public health crisis, impact on livelihoods and societies or global economic recession, the fallouts of the pandemic have been colossal.\nWe support the efforts of the United Nations, World Health Organization and the World Bank Group in leading the global response to the pandemic. In particular, we commend the UN Secretary General for launching the Comprehensive Response to COVID-19.\nWhat matters most in the ongoing health crisis is an easy, smooth and affordable access by all to anti-COVID vaccines after they are developed; sharing of knowledge and experiences; and provision of timely supply of medical equipment and medicines.\nProtecting lives of the people both from disease and hunger is the supreme duty of the Governments. While we have deployed all our efforts and resources to that end, international solidarity becomes equally important.\nIt is worrisome that the crisis is unfolding against the backdrop of an already uncertain international order.\nGeopolitical tensions are resurfacing. Peace and stability still remain an unfulfilled aspiration in many parts of the world.\nChallenges such as arms race, climate change, and disasters impede the prospects of peace and sustainable development.\nThe invisible virus has only made the severity of these maladies visible. This has further aggravated the trade tensions, global inequality, financial uncertainty, and debt crisis.\nMultilateral cooperation has been an obvious casualty in the face of unilateral tendencies and protectionist policies.\nThe theme of \u2018the future we want, and the UN we need\u2019 resonates very well with the present situation.\nIt is unthinkable to talk about degrading the value of multilateralism at a time when its relevancy becomes more pronounced than ever. Larger global good, not the parochial national interest, should underpin multilateralism and the rules-based order.\nThis historic 75th anniversary of the United Nations is a time to muster stronger political will for an enhanced international cooperation and solidarity and envision a future that is safer, more equitable and just.\nOnly a collaborative, democratic, science-based and coordinated global partnership will help us face the difficult months and years ahead.\nMr. President,\nAs we embark on the decade of action and delivery to implement the Agenda 2030, the current crisis has pushed us to the brink of losing the gains made in achieving the SDGs.\nThe countries like LDCs, LLDCs and SIDs are facing limitation of resources, social protection, and requisite health infrastructures. The distress has been further compounded by the halt in tourism, remittances and disruptions on supply chains and trade.\nPoverty is increasing, mostly in developing countries, for the first time in the last twenty years.\nThe current crisis threatens hard-earned achievements in key areas, pushing our plan to graduate from the LDC status in peril.\nIn order to prevent inequalities from deepening, timely realization of SDGs should be the fulcrum of our actions, compass of our aspiration, and the signpost of our recovery efforts.\nWe must reach to those who are at the bottom.\nExcellencies\nThe Secretary-General\u2019s opening statement rightly highlights the current challenges facing the world and provides a way-forward.\nNepal is deeply concerned about the worsening humanitarian situations in Libya, Syria and Yemen.\nProtracted conflicts inflict painful miseries to the innocent civilians.\nNepal calls for peaceful resolution of all such conflicts, led and owned by the people of the respective countries.\nWe would like to see peace and stability in the Middle East with a twostate solution for Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security with secure and recognized international borders based on relevant United Nations resolutions.\nEffective and sustainable peacebuilding efforts must ensure inclusive national leadership and ownership.\nAs a major troop and police-contributing country and a member of the Peacebuilding Commission, Nepal has unfailingly responded to the UN\u2019s call for deployment without any caveat.\nWith over six-decades of partnership in UN peace operations, Nepal\u2019s commitment to international peace and stability is stronger than ever. We consider the troops and police-contributing countries should have greater share of decisionmaking positions both in headquarters and in the field missions.\nThe safety, security and dignity of peacekeepers are vitally important as we increasingly engage in complex multi-dimensional peace operations.\nPredictable, adequate and sustained resources are equally fundamental for the success of peace operations.\nThe global community needs to unite against the transnational problems such as terrorism, organized crime, illicit financial flows, human and drug trafficking.\nNepal condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations; or other activities inflicting pain and suffering to the innocent people.\nWe call for an early conclusion of a comprehensive convention against terrorism.\nMr. President,\nIn 2019, the world military expenditure amounted to $1.9 trillion.\nEven a fraction of those resources could bring respite to the millions of people suffering from poverty, hunger, and deprivation.\nThe arms race, weaponization of outer space, and cyber warfare inflict a huge cost on humanity.\nWe all know what is more important at present \u2014 nuclear weapons or accessible vaccine against COVID-19!\nThe world needs more masks, not muskets; more protective equipment, not destructive weapons; and more social spending to save lives, not military spending to destroy lives.\nEven when disarmament related processes including the NPT Review Conference are postponed due to the pandemic, the concerned parties must continue to fulfill their treaty obligations to make the world safer.\nWe reiterate our call for a general and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction.\nRegional approaches to disarmament complement the global initiatives. As the host country to the UN Regional Center for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific, we underline the need to strengthen such regional approaches including the \u2018Kathmandu Process\u2019.\nMr. President,\nClimate crisis continues to pose an existential threat. The silence of the large emitters should not lead to the failure of responsibilities.\nNepal has dedicated more than 60 percent of its territory to the service of ecosystem. Our forests and mountains work as environmental purifiers.\nOur mountains contribute to the climate and ecosystem of oceans through hundreds of snow-fed rivers streaming down to the oceans. Nepal\u2019s Himalayas function as natural climate stabilizer. They contribute to maintain natural cooling system as they lie in the hottest zone of the planet between the tropic of Cancer and Capricorn. Apart from this, they contribute to the natural recharge system ensuring continuous supply of fresh water essential for living beings.\nThere is an organic link between mountains and oceans in maintaining the natural climate cycle. In this sense, Nepal\u2019s mountains are not only our assets, but they are of global significance in view of their vital contribution to the maintenance of health of the planet.\nOur economic activities and mode of power generation are the most climate friendly. It is an unpleasant irony that we substantially contribute to sustaining ecosystem and emit negligibly, yet we bear the severest brunt of climate change.\nGlobal warming has eroded the health of our high mountains and ecosystems. Global pollution and climate change have contributed to the fast melting of ice which must be a matter of serious concern for all of us. This may lead to the outburst of glacial lakes resulting in huge loss of lives and properties downstream.\nWe call for full and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement, robust climate action and easy access to climate financing.\nWe are concerned about the deteriorating health of overall ocean ecosystem due to the excessive human activities. We must preserve the common heritage of mankind. Prudent behaviour on the part of all stakeholders, specially the coastal states is critically important to maintain ocean ecosystem.\nNepal appreciates the progress achieved so far in the BBNJ process and looks forward to its successful conclusion.\nExcellencies,\nGlobal trading system has been pushed into peril. Reform of WTO has become urgent to ensure level playing field and rebuild trust.\nThe WTO should launch a renewed and revitalized global trading framework that enables the LDCs and LLDCs benefit equitably.\nAid for Trade has to be channeled for export competitiveness and resilience.\nProgress in technology has been a major drive for development and change. Addressing digital divide and capacity constraints of LDCs is crucial for realizing a fair share of benefits of e-commerce and technology dividend. They must have an easy and affordable access to technology.\nMr. President,\nNepal\u2019s commitment to human rights is total and unwavering.\nNepal\u2019s democratic constitution guarantees the universally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms and other principles such as multiparty democratic polity, pluralism, independent judiciary, separation of power, rule of law, proportional representation, periodic elections and social and economic justice.\nNepal does not condone impunity in serious violations of human rights. We are fully committed to concluding the ongoing transitional justice process in line with our commitment. Concerns of the victims will be addressed.\nThe year 2020 also marks the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women. While we have made significant strides in ensuring rights and empowerment of women; we are also committed to address the gaps and challenges.\nCurrently, as a member of the Human Rights Council, Nepal continues to contribute constructively to promote human rights with an objective approach in a holistic manner.\nWith a view to contributing further, Nepal has presented its candidature for the re-election to the Human Rights Council for the term of 2021-2023. We count on the valuable support of all UN member States to our candidature.\nNepal attaches high priority to the safety, security and well-being of the migrant workers. Providing adequate safeguard from exclusion, xenophobia and discrimination against migrant workers must be a common agenda of all at this difficult time.\nWider ownership and implementation of Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration is essential to make migration work for all.\nNepal has hosted thousands of refugees for decades on a humanitarian ground. Refugees\u2019 right to return to their homeland in safety and dignity must be honoured by all.\nMr. President,\nIn my address to the 73rd UN General Assembly, I had outlined the monumental political transformation in Nepal and its consolidation through a democratic constitution written by the people\u2019s representatives.\nHaving resolved the fundamental political issues, we are now focused in bringing economic transformation envisioned around the national aspiration of \u2018Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali\u2019. This aspiration takes a cue from the 2030 Agenda, and the notion of comprehensive democracy that looks after not only political rights and freedoms of the people but also takes care of the economic, social and cultural rights and wellbeing.\nWe have created an investment friendly atmosphere with overall improvement in good governance. We need international support measures in the form of technical, technological, financial and investment.\nDespite resource constraints, we have significantly increased investment in rural infrastructures and social sector.\nThe hazardous mode of river-crossing through tuins has been replaced by bridges.\nWe provide monthly social security payments to the elderly, single women, persons with disability and the destitute.\nWe have launched the provision of health insurance for elderly people further expanding its coverage.\nChildren from Dalits and marginalized communities in backward areas are provided with monthly scholarships at all schools. Basic education is made free for all with the provision of books and educational materials.\nWe have achieved nearly universal enrollment and gender parity of children in school, and significantly reduced girls drop out.\nWe have turned the country free from open-defecation. This way, we have started new era of decent way of life.\nBy extending social care and protection, we have made our cities free from street-children, street-people and beggars.\nWe have healed the wounds of earthquakes. We have reconstructed residential houses, schools, colleges, hospitals and heritage sites. We have also relocated people to safe areas.\nAll these achievements reflect the wider enjoyment of social and economic rights by our people.\nMr. President,\nThe Charter of the United Nations, non-alignment, the five principles of peaceful coexistence, international law and norms of world peace guide\nNepal\u2019s foreign policy. We believe in \u2018amity with all and enmity with none\u2019.\nGuided by these principles, the Government of Nepal is firmly committed to safeguarding Nepal\u2019s sovereignty, territorial integrity and maintaining friendly relations with its neighbours and all other countries in the world.\nWe support an inclusive and fair international order founded on equality, mutual respect and justice.\nAs a believer in regional economic cooperation, we are playing our due role under the frameworks of SAARC, BIMSTEC and ACD.\nMr. President,\nThe United Nations has an unparalleled scope, legitimacy and normative impact.\nNepal reposes enduring faith in multilateralism with United Nations at the centre.\nWe underline the need to reform the UN Security Council to make it more representative, transparent, democratic, and accountable. The principle of sovereign equality must remain at the core of all reform initiatives.\nWe also underscore the importance of the ongoing processes of GA Revitalization and Review of Peacebuilding Architecture.\nReform must aim at making the UN more efficient, effective and transparent that complement national efforts to bringing positive change in peoples\u2019 lives thereby ensuring equal dignity of all peoples.\nWe support the reform measures initiated by the Secretary-General and expect that the UN would make significant positive impacts on the neediest countries.\nCompared to 1945, the founding year of the United Nations, the world has emerged with better knowledge, more advanced technology and many other advances in different fields. However, challenges of global scale still persist. This provides greater scope and reason for global partnership.\nContrary to this, it is unfortunate that we witness in some quarters lesser desire to work under the multilateral framework.\nWe, the Member States, must shoulder the responsibility to strengthen the UN and pursue the path of multilateral cooperation. There is no alternative to this.\nJust as the United Nations was created in the devastation wrought by the Second World War to lead the world on the path of peace, security and development, why not we think in the same vein a more prosperous and healthy world in the wake of the invisible yet equally powerful enemy of COVID-19?\nTo conclude, Mr. President, the founders of the United Nations chose peace over war, cooperation over collision, development over deprivation and human dignity over denigration.\nAt this historic 75th anniversary of our Organization, let us recommit to uphold those values and work together in a spirit of cooperation and solidarity to lead the humanity to peace and prosperity.\nThank you!"

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nPeace be with all of you!\nI offer cordial greetings to you, Mr President, and to all the Delegations taking part in this significant Seventy-fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly. In particular, I greet the Secretary General, Mr Antonio Guterres, the participating Heads of State and Government, and all those who are following the General Debate.\nThe seventy-fifth Anniversary of the United Nations offers me a fitting occasion to express once again the Holy See\u2019s desire that this Organization increasingly serve as a sign of unity between States and an instrument of service to the entire human family.\nIn these days, our world continues to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to the loss of so many lives. This crisis is changing our way of life, calling into question our economic, health and social systems, and exposing our human fragility.\nThe pandemic, indeed, calls us \u201cto seize this time of trial as a time of choosing, a time to choose what matters and what passes away, a time to separate what is necessary from what is not\u201d. It can represent a concrete opportunity for conversion, for transformation, for rethinking our way of life and our economic and social systems, which are widening the gap between rich and poor based on an unjust distribution of resources. On the other hand, the pandemic can be the occasion for a \u201cdefensive retreat\u201d into greater individualism and elitism.\nWe are faced, then, with a choice between two possible paths. One path leads to the consolidation of multilateralism as the expression of a renewed sense of global co-responsibility, a solidarity grounded in justice and the attainment of peace and unity within the human family, which is God\u2019s plan for our world. The other path emphasizes self-sufficiency, nationalism, protectionism, individualism and isolation; it excludes the poor, the vulnerable and those dwelling on the peripheries of life. That path would certainly be detrimental to the whole community, causing self-inflicted wounds on everyone. It must not prevail.\nThe pandemic has highlighted the urgent need to promote public health and to make every person\u2019s right to basic medical care a reality. For this reason, I renew my appeal to political leaders and the private sector to spare no effort to ensure access to COVID-19 vaccines and to the essential technologies needed to care for the sick. If anyone should be given preference, let it be the poorest, the most vulnerable, those who so often experience discrimination because they have neither power nor economic resources.\nThe current crisis has also demonstrated that solidarity must not be an empty word or promise. It has also shown us the importance of avoiding every temptation to exceed our natural limits. \u201cWe have the freedom needed to limit and direct technology; we can put it at the service of another type of progress, one which is healthier, more human, more social, more integral\u201d. This also needs to be taken into careful consideration in discussions on the complex issue of artificial intelligence (AI).\nAlong these same lines, I think of the effects of the pandemic on employment, a sector already destabilized by a labour market driven by increasing uncertainty and widespread robotization. There is an urgent need to find new forms of work truly capable of fulfilling our human potential and affirming our dignity. In order to ensure dignified employment, there must be a change in the prevailing economic paradigm, which seeks only to expand companies\u2019 profits. Offering jobs to more people should be one of the main objectives of every business, one of the criteria for the success of productive activity. Technological progress is valuable and necessary, provided that it serves to make people\u2019s work more dignified and safe, less burdensome and stressful.\nAll this calls for a change of direction. To achieve this, we already possess the necessary cultural and technological resources, and social awareness. This change of direction will require, however, a more robust ethical framework capable of overcoming \u201ctoday\u2019s widespread and quietly growing culture of waste\u201d.\nAt the origin of this \u201cthrowaway culture\u201d is a gross lack of respect for human dignity, the promotion of ideologies with reductive understandings of the human person, a denial of the universality of fundamental human rights, and a craving for absolute power and control that is widespread in today\u2019s society. Let us name this for what it is: an attack against humanity itself.\nIt is in fact painful to see the number of fundamental human rights that in our day continue to be violated with impunity. The list of such violations is indeed lengthy, and offers us a frightening picture of a humanity abused, wounded, deprived of dignity, freedom and hope for the future. As part of this picture, religious believers continue to endure every kind of persecution, including genocide, because of their beliefs. We Christians too are victims of this: how many of our brothers and sisters throughout the world are suffering, forced at times to flee from their ancestral lands, cut off from their rich history and culture.\nWe should also admit that humanitarian crises have become the status quo, in which people\u2019s right to life, liberty and personal security are not protected. Indeed, as shown by conflicts worldwide, the use of explosive weapons, especially in populated areas, is having a dramatic long-term humanitarian impact. Conventional weapons are becoming less and less \u201cconventional\u201d and more and more \u201cweapons of mass destruction\u201d, wreaking havoc on cities, schools, hospitals, religious sites, infrastructures and basic services needed by the population.\nWhat is more, great numbers of people are being forced to leave their homes. Refugees, migrants and the internally displaced frequently find themselves abandoned in their countries of origin, transit and destination, deprived of any chance to better their situation in life and that of their families. Worse still, thousands are intercepted at sea and forcibly returned to detention camps, where they meet with torture and labour, exploited in degrading jobs and denied a just wage. This is intolerable, yet intentionally ignored by many!\nThe numerous and significant international efforts to respond to these crises begin with great promise \u2014 here I think of the two Global Compacts on Refugees and on Migration \u2014 yet many lack the necessary political support to prove successful. Others fail because individual states shirk their responsibilities and commitments. All the same, the current crisis offers an opportunity for the United Nations to help build a more fraternal and compassionate society.\nThis includes reconsidering the role of economic and financial institutions, like that of Bretton-Woods, which must respond to the rapidly growing inequality between the super-rich and the permanently poor. An economic model that encourages subsidiarity, supports economic development at the local level and invests in education and infrastructure benefiting local communities, will lay the foundation not only for economic success but also for the renewal of the larger community and nation. Here I would renew my appeal that\n\u201cin light of the present circumstances... all nations be enabled to meet the greatest needs of the moment through the reduction, if not the forgiveness, of the debt burdening the balance sheets of the poorest nations\u201d.\nThe international community ought to make every effort to put an end to economic injustices.\n\u201cWhen multilateral credit organizations provide advice to various nations, it is important to keep in mind the lofty concepts of fiscal justice, the public budgets responsible for their indebtedness and, above all, an effective promotion of the poorest, which makes them protagonists in the social network.\u201d\nWe have a responsibility to offer development assistance to poor nations and debt relief to highly indebted nations.\n\u201cA new ethics presupposes being aware of the need for everyone to work together to close tax shelters, avoid evasions and money laundering that rob society, as well as to speak to nations about the importance of defending justice and the common good over the interests of the most powerful companies and multinationals.\u201d\nNow is a fitting time to renew the architecture of international finance. Mr. President,\nFive years ago, I had the opportunity to address the General Assembly in person on its seventieth anniversary. My visit took place at a time marked by truly dynamic multilateralism. It was a moment of great hope and promise for the international community, on the eve of the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Some months later, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change was also adopted.\nYet we must honestly admit that, even though some progress has been made, promises made five years ago. I can only reiterate that \u201cwe must avoid every temptation to fall into a declarationist nominalism which would assuage our consciences. We need to ensure that our institutions are truly effective in the struggle against all these scourges\u201d.\nI think of the alarming situation in the Amazon and its indigenous peoples. Here we see that the environmental crisis is inseparably linked to a social crisis, and that caring for the environment calls for an integrated approach to combatting poverty and exclusion.\nTo be sure, the growth of an integral ecological sensitivity and the desire for action is a positive step.\n\u201cWe must not place the burden on the next generations to take on the problems caused by the previous ones... We must seriously ask ourselves if there is the political will to allocate with honesty, responsibility and courage, more human, financial and technological resources to mitigate the negative effects of climate change, as well as to help the poorest and most vulnerable populations who suffer from them the most.\u201d\nThe Holy See will continue to play its part. As a concrete sign of the Holy See\u2019s commitment to care for our common home, I recently ratified the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.\nMr. President,\nWe cannot fail to acknowledge the devastating effects of the COVID-19 crisis on children, including unaccompanied young migrants and refugees. Violence against children, including the horrible scourge of child abuse and pornography, has also dramatically increased.\nMillions of children are presently unable to return to school. In many parts of the world, this situation risks leading to an increase in child labour, exploitation, abuse and malnutrition. Sad to say, some countries and international institutions are also promoting abortion as one of the so-called \u201cessential services\u201d provided in the humanitarian response to the pandemic. It is troubling to see how simple and convenient it has become for some to deny the existence of a human life as a solution to problems that can and must be solved for both the mother and her unborn child.\nI urge civil authorities to be especially attentive to children who are denied their fundamental rights and dignity, particularly their right to life and to schooling. I cannot help but think of the appeal of that courageous young woman, Malala Yousafzai, who speaking five years ago in the General Assembly, reminded us that \u201cone child, one teacher, one book and one pen can change the world\u201d.\nThe first teachers of every child are his or her mother and father, the family, which the Universal Declaration of Human Rights describes as the \u201cnatural and fundamental group unit of society\u201d. All too often, the family is the victim of forms of ideological colonialism that weaken it and end up producing in many of its members, especially the most vulnerable, the young and the elderly, a feeling of being orphaned and lacking roots. The breakdown of the family is reflected in the social fragmentation that hinders our efforts to confront common enemies. It is time that we reassess and recommit ourselves to achieving our goals.\nOne such goal is the advancement of women. This year marks the twentyfifth anniversary of the Beijing Conference on Women. At every level of society, women now play an important role, offering their singular contribution and courageously promoting the common good. Many women, however, continue to be left behind: victims of slavery, trafficking, violence, exploitation and degrading treatment. To them, and to those who forced to live apart from their families, I express my fraternal closeness. At the same time, I appeal once more for greater determination and commitment in the fight against those heinous practices that debase not only women, but all humanity, which by its silence and lack of effective action becomes an accomplice in them.\nMr. President,\nWe must ask ourselves if the principal threats to peace and security - poverty, epidemics, terrorism and so many others - can be effectively be countered when the arms race, including nuclear weapons, continues to squander precious resources that could better be used to benefit the integral development of peoples and protect the natural environment.\nWe need to break with the present climate of distrust. At present, we are witnessing an erosion of multilateralism, which is all the more serious in light of the development of new forms of military technology, such as lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS) which irreversibly alter the nature of warfare, detaching it further from human agency.\nWe need to dismantle the perverse logic that links personal and national security to the possession of weaponry. This logic serves only to increase the profits of the arms industry, while fostering a climate of distrust and fear between persons and peoples.\nNuclear deterrence, in particular, creates an ethos of fear based on the threat of mutual annihilation; in this way, it ends up poisoning relationships between peoples and obstructing dialogue. That is why it is so important to support the principal international legal instruments on nuclear disarmament, nonproliferation and prohibition. The Holy See trusts that the forthcoming Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) will result in concrete action in accordance with our joint intention \u201cto achieve at the earliest possible date the cessation of the nuclear arms race and to undertake effective measures in the direction of nuclear disarmament\u201d.\nIn addition, our strife-ridden world needs the United Nations to become an ever more effective international workshop for peace. This means that the members of the Security Council, especially the Permanent Members, must act with greater unity and determination. In this regard, the recent adoption of a global cease-fire during the present crisis is a very noble step, one that demands good will on the part of all for its continued implementation. Here I would also reiterate the importance of relaxing international sanctions that make it difficult for states to provide adequate support for their citizens.\nMr. President,\nWe never emerge from a crisis just as we were. We come out either better or worse. This is why, at this critical juncture, it is our duty to rethink the future of our common home and our common project. A complex task lies before us, one that requires a frank and coherent dialogue aimed at strengthening multilateralism and cooperation between states. The present crisis has further demonstrated the limits of our self-sufficiency as well as our common vulnerability. It has forced us to think clearly about how we want to emerge from this: either better or worse.\nThe pandemic has shown us that we cannot live without one another, or worse still, pitted against one another. The United Nations was established to bring nations together, to be a bridge between peoples. Let us make good use of this institution in order to transform the challenge that lies before us into an opportunity to build together, once more, the future we all desire.\nGod bless you all!\nThank you, Mr. President."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nAt the outset, on behalf of the Delegation of the Lao PDR, I would like to congratulate you, Mr. Volkan Bozkir, on your election as President of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. I am confident that with your extensive and rich diplomatic experience, you will be able to lead the deliberation of this UNGA Session under the theme \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism\u201d, which is most relevant to the current situation of the international environment, to a great success. Our delegation is ready to extend full support and cooperation to you in the discharge of your noble duties. Let me also commend your predecessor, H.E. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, for his successful presidency of the 74th Session of the UNGA, amid the advert impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the ongoing work of the UN.\nMr. President,\n75 years ago, the United Nations has been created from the ashes of the Second World War aimed at saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war that brought untold sufferings to our mankind one after another. Ever since its advent, the United Nations has evolved into a main mechanism for preserving international peace and security, which constitutes a significant prerequisite for the promotion of international cooperation and socio-economic development to be thrived. UN Charter has become a significant tool that identified mechanisms and principles for our joint collective efforts to achieve our noble common objectives. To date, 75 years have passed and we can say that under the UN auspices, the international community has made a number of significant achievements. Conflict resolution mechanism through peaceful means has turned into principle and prevailing trend. International laws and treaties have been gradually enhanced and served as a tool to prevent and resolve various issues in areas such as disarmament, racial discrimination, religion and cultural differences, promotion and protection of human rights, and gender equality, to name a few.\nMore importantly, multilateral cooperation under the flag of the United Nations has synergized collective efforts in responding to and addressing major common challenges that no single country can do alone, such as an issue of climate change, pandemic, terrorism and others. In addition, we have seen joint efforts in tackling challenges under the framework of MDGs, SDGs, Action Plans to help vulnerable countries, in particular least developed countries (LDCs), land-locked developing countries (LLDCs) and small island developing states (SIDs). Those collective efforts have helped a number of millions of people to get out of poverty and hunger and to have access to education, health service and improve gender equality.\nThose are some significant achievements of the United Nations. But of course, the regional and international environment in the past 70 years is definitely different from the current setting. Therefore, the United Nations has to be adapted and strengthened if it is to effectively deliver its mandates on maintaining international peace and security as well as promoting development cooperation. Against this backdrop, the United Nations should be reformed to fit the current environment in our joint efforts in addressing the unfolded significant obstacles to peace and development, such as lasting resolution to the Middle East problem, in particular the Palestinian issue and the call for lifting of economic embargo on Cuba and so on. Cooperation for development should be further enhanced and prioritized. Without development, people will remain poor and hungry, as a result peace cannot be sustained, and social problems, such as crimes, drugs, human trafficking and refugees will remain unresolved. This requires the international community to actively address the pressing challenges together.\nMr. President,\nAs we all know, the world is currently facing serious outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, which is an immediate and long-term challenge for us to respond and recover from its impact on economic development. Over the past decades, the world has never seen the pandemic on this scale, more than 30 million people infected and nearly 1 million people have died. Besides, it has posed huge impact on socioeconomic development in many countries leading the world economy to recession, many companies went bankrupt and unemployment skyrocketed. Achievements and efforts to eradicate poverty and progress in the implementation of SDGs has been severely impacted. Therefore, the most immediate task for us is to jointly contain the COVID-19 pandemic as well as to implement strict preventive measures. For the Lao PDR, we have adopted very strict preventive measures and achieved quite a good result, with only 23 confirmed infected cases and no fatality. This achievement is partly due to the cooperation and assistance provided by our friendly countries and international organizations. On this note, I would like to take this opportunity to express our high appreciation to our friendly countries and international organizations for such valuable assistance accorded to us.\nI am confident that, with the committed joint efforts and with the progress being made on the research and development of vaccine of which some are in the final stage, we will find the vaccine that is effective and safe to prevent COVID-19 soon. However, universal access to the vaccine is another important matter that needs to be considered. Otherwise, we will not be able to respond to the pandemic effectively. In this regard, I would like to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt congratulation to the efforts made by international organizations, in particular the World Health Organization and all countries for the assistance extended to other member states who are facing difficulties, which enables us to control the outbreak of the COVID-19 at a certain level, including the initiative to establish a project to promote and ensure global access to vaccine without discrimination. If we can do so, we then will be able to meet the slogan \u201cleaving no one behind\u201d.\nAnother important task is the post COVID-19 economic recovery. How are we going to revitalize our world economy and stimulate economic growth. I believe that the international community has to collectively address the issues that are obstacle to the international trade, funding and technology access and build mutual trust for a win-win cooperation, only this then that it will bring benefit and prosperity to the international community. Thus, the international community must enhance a policy of open trade and cooperation, integration and connectivity, as well as addressing the debt issue in order for the world economy to be able to thrive.\nMr. President,\nToday, climate change has induced more frequent and severe natural disasters that brought huge impact on development, particularly food security and infrastructure development. Therefore, building society with climate resilience and adaptation is very important. In this connection, it requires that international community provides financial support and technological know-how to the least developed countries in order for them to be able to respond to the natural disaster. On the same note, it also calls for concerted efforts from all countries around the world to consume natural resources in a sustainable manner, employ more alternative energy and follow the commitment under the Paris Agreement on reducing the greenhouse gas emission that contributed to the rising of world temperature.\nWhat is more important now is the fact that we have only 10 years left for the fulfilment of SDGs by 2030 with the slogan \u201cleaving no one behind\u201d. In the past years, although many countries have actively implemented SDGs and many achievements have been made, in particular on poverty reduction, but with the impact of COVID-19, achieving SDGs will be a challenging task. I am of the view that in order to meet our lofty goals, the developed countries including development partners must honor their obligation on ODA to vulnerable countries, such as least developed countries (LDCs), land-locked developing countries (LLDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS). Otherwise, it will be very difficult for those countries to achieve SDGs on their own.\nFor Lao PDR, we have integrated SDGs and its targets into our 8th 5-year National Socio-economic Development Plan (NSEDP) for 2016-2020 and will continue to further streamline SDGs into our next 9th 5-year Plan. In addition, we have carried out outreach public awareness campaign on SDGs at central and local levels so that all sectors of the society are well aware of its importance and take part in its implementation. Lao PDR plans to present our second Voluntary National Review at the High-Level Political Forum in July 2021 to report and evaluate progress made on the implementation of SDGs. In general, through the implementation of our National Socio-economic Development Plan, as well as the SDGs, Lao PDR has made many significant achievements. The country continues to enjoy political stability, social order and continued economic growth, which has significantly contributed to the poverty reduction and improving living standard of all multi-ethnic people. We have been able to reduce poverty rate from 46 per cent in 1992 to around 18 per cent to date. Nonetheless, due to the impact of natural disasters and COVID-19 pandemic, the economic growth is expected to go down in 2020, but may not be negative. In our upcoming 9th Five-year National Socio-economic Development Plan for 2021- 2025, Lao PDR will continue to develop our economy in line with sustainable and green growth strategy, integrate SDGs into our NSEDP, as well as to build a strong foundation and necessary condition for the country to graduate from the LDC status in the future.\nIn the regional cooperation context, the Lao PDR continues to support commitment and efforts of ASEAN in the promotion of peace, stability and security of the region. We also embrace our efforts for regional and sub-regional economic integration through ASEAN cooperation framework, ASEAN dialogue partnership and cooperation with other countries, including the ASEAN-UN cooperation framework aimed at achieving ASEAN Vision 2025 and other priorities. We also support ASEAN in the collaboration with WHO and countries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and seeking solution to economic recovery from the pandemic.\nMr. President,\nIn conclusion, I have a strong confidence that multilateral cooperation, conflict resolution by peaceful means and cooperation for development under the UN Charter remain a relevant mechanism in our efforts to synergizing and unifying us for maintaining international peace and security and our concerted efforts in addressing our common challenges lying ahead. Lessons from history remind us that unilateralism and the use of force to solve the problems always led to war and ushered in unwanted disaster to our mankind. In this respect, we have to try to avoid any emerging elements causing disunity so we can prevent disaster from ever occurring again to our humanity.\nLao PDR has put great efforts in its national development, as well as efforts to eradicating poverty and lifting the country out of LDC status and we found that cooperation under the UN auspices is very important in assisting developing countries in this regard. We stand ready to fulfil our obligations and actively contribute in such cooperation mechanism.\nIn this spirit, Lao PDR decided to present our candidature for membership of the ECOSOC for the term 2023-2025. It is my hope that as the Lao PDR seeks a membership in this important UN body for the first time, we would highly appreciate the valuable support from all member states. I promise that, if elected, Lao PDR will actively contribute to the work of the Council.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "Distinguished Mr. President,\nYour Excellences! Ladies and Gentlemen!\nOn behalf of Ukraine I have the honour to congratulate you, Mr. Bozkir, on your election as President of the 75th UN General Assembly session. You are steering the Assembly in hard times when even traditional international instruments and formats may not work. That is why I want to assure that Ukraine has been and will continue to be a reliable partner for you and the United Nations, even despite the fact that we are separated by thousands of kilometers.\nA year ago, in New York we discussed threats to the future of the world, we devised plans, we made forecasts. But could anyone has imagined back then that the year 2020 would stage such a crush test for the planet? The countries lock down their borders, the Summer Olympic Games postponed, and the session of the UN General Assembly is held online. A year ago, we would say that this is a script for the apocalyptical blockbuster, not the realities of 2020.\nIn such uneasy for the world times it makes sense to recall the feelings of the leaders of the United Nations founding states 75 years ago. The humanity just survived the most horrendous war. The world resembled a soldier who was strolling across a blood-drenched field a minute after the explosions stopped. Emaciated, hollowed, at a loss but alive.\nThe Second World War became a \u201cglobal earthquake\u201d that claimed tens of millions of lives. Yet humanity managed to recover. And on 24 October 1945, at the conference in San Francisco, the UN founding nations, with Ukraine among them, put aside all contradictions and got united to build a better world together.\nUndoubtedly, during these 75 years numerous achievements were made in terms of economic development, poverty eradication, minimization of wars and cataclysms that could have happened was it not for the United Nations. The humanity conquered the Space, and even can hold UN sessions remotely thanks to modern technologies.\nSpeaking the language of these technologies, the UN has become a software that saved the world from critical errors.\nAt the same time, we have to acknowledge that the system is getting glitched more and more. It is being attacked by new \u201cbugs\u201d or \u201cviruses\u201d. And their containment is not always efficient.\nI am saying it as the Head of a state in which in the 21st century the Russian Federation annexed the Crimean Peninsula. Head of the state, which is containing Russia\u2019s military aggression in Donbas for the seventh year in a row.\nWhat feelings would the founders of the United Nations have, had they known that 75 years later, in the center of Europe, there would be a war? That in Crimea human rights would be flagrantly violated, that persecutions of Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars would be taking place. That militarization of the peninsula and water areas around it would be building up, which would undermine security balance of the Black Sea region. Would they change something in the UN Charter and mechanisms of the United Nations had they known that 75 years later, as a result of the war in Donbas, there would be 14,000 killed and almost 1.5 million people would lose their homes?\nUndoubtedly, over the last year we proved that Ukraine really strives for peace. We managed to unblock the dialogue, we resumed meetings of the Normandy format leaders, we made substantial progress in mutual release of the detained persons. And starting from 27 July, there is a comprehensive ceasefire in place, which, despite attempts to disrupt it, still gives hope for achieving sustainable ceasefire. And it is badly needed to keep moving towards genuine peace.\nThe next steps on this way should become the withdrawal of unlawful military formations and armaments from the occupied territories, return of control over the state border, and, finally, restoring territorial integrity of Ukraine within the internationally recognized borders.\nWe are grateful to our international partners for the help and support on this difficult way. We hope for further unity of the international community on this cause. I\u2019m convinced that it is the United Nations that should play an important role in restoring sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, along with respect of the international law. We need to improve the existing mechanisms to this end.\nIt is unacceptable when sovereignty of the independent state is violated by one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council. It ultimately proves that the mechanisms of the 1945 do not work today to the full extent. All this can bring about further depreciation of the Security Council. Ukraine will actively participate in its reform. This body should become more representative, balanced, transparent and efficient. It is in the United Nations\u2019 vested interest to have an effective instrument if somebody is violating and abusing the veto right and the status of the permanent member.\nIn addition, availing myself of this opportunity I want to invite our friends to participate in the establishment of the international Crimea platform for concerted actions to protect the rights of the Crimeans and de occupy the peninsula.\nI also call for support of the updated resolution \u201cSituation with human rights in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine\u201d that will be presented to the General Assembly by the end of this year.\nAnd what is the most important \u2014 the cases of Crimea and Donbas should not become customary elements of the international landscape where only reports, conferences and protocol statements on the anniversaries of occupation will be taken as sufficient form of the international reaction.\nOn the contrary \u2014 until the wound in the center of Europe is bleeding, the pain will be felt all over the world. And the only recipe for the efficient treatment is the de-occupation of Crimea and Donbas.\nI understand that from 2014 on this message is heard at the UN every year. But this is exactly where the biggest problem lies. And it is not only about the Ukrainian case; it is about all global threats to the planet, reports on which are getting longer and longer with every passing year.\nAnd what is the most terrifying is that calamities have become a new normal. The world got accustomed to horrible news. They still shock but are quickly forgotten once a new information bomb explodes on the global agenda.\nAt the last year\u2019s Assembly session, I said: \u201cThere is no more a notion of somebody else\u2019s war. Our planet is not that big anymore\u201d.\nIt is proved by the MH17 case. It is proved by the environmental threats. By problems with access to food and drinking water.\nIt is proved by information threats to the world. When disinformation and fake news can influence world markets,stock exchanges and even electoral processes.\nUkraine, being one of the countries that from 2014 on actively counteracts the propaganda and information attacks, stands ready to initiate the establishment in Kyiv of the headquarters of the international office to counter disinformation and propaganda.\nThe fact that our planet is not that big anymore was finally proved by the year 2020. Fires in Australia that shook the world. Or downing of a Boeing 737, when Ukrainian aircraft carrying the citizens of Ukraine, Canada, Iran, Afghanistan, United Kingdom and Sweden was struck down over the territory of Iran.\nAnd of course \u2014 COVID-19 pandemic, which spread at a lightning speed. The mankind did not even manage to google \u201cCovid\u201d and \u201cWuhan\u201d when coronavirus was already knocking on the door of every house.\nConsider also this. Coronavirus spares no one. It does not care whether the country has nuclear weapons or what is the level of its GDP, whether the state is part of G7 or G20, whether Christianity, Islam, Judaism or other religions are professed in this country. All of it matters nothing for COVID.\nThe COVID-19 showed that global world is not just the world without borders. It is also about global responsibility, when counteracting joint threats should involve not 7, not 20, but at least 193 countries.\nToday we are coming to understanding that the fight against COVID-19 will not take just one year. It is hardly the last pandemic that we will have to see through. That is why we have to emerge from the existing crisis stronger and well prepared.\nThis is the test for all countries. A race for limited resources will only exacerbate the problems. What we need is sincerity in dialogue and active solidarity, because this is where the value of multilateralism lies.\nWe have to overcome together the most serious economic crisis of the last years. The expected figures of GDP fall are sometimes double-digit. This is not just the statistics interesting for selected experts. This is the reduction of quality of life of billions of people, looming rise of a threat of hunger for millions.\nTo unite efforts of all the countries is a must of our time. Ukraine cannot stand aside and is ready to make its own contribution in ensuring, in particular, the food security of the mankind.\nMr. President,\nEvery year the call for actions instead of talks is getting louder and louder in the General Assembly. It testifies to the crisis the United Nations, the security architecture, the health of humanity, our economies and the world as a whole find themselves in.\nThe 75th anniversary of the UN foundation should become an impetus for transforming our Organization into a more dynamic and efficient body.\nI really want to start my speech in 2021 by saying that the 75th General Assembly session will come down in history as an example of returning to active multilateralism and efficient international solidarity.\nA session which did not only recall the Purposes and Principles of the UN Charter but started to permanently and unwaveringly follow them.\nA session which revived the truth that was fundamental when the UN was established: we don\u2019t have a planet B. We live here and just once.\nAnd this is exactly the future we want, and this is exactly the UN we need. I sincerely wish you, Mr. President, to achieve this goal, along with all stakeholders. I am convinced that these are 193 UN Member States.\nThank you for attention."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nFirst of all, please allow me to extend my sincere congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your election as President of the 75th session of the General Assembly.\nThis year is one of the utmost significance as the United Nations marks its 75th Anniversary. The organization has symbolised solidarity and cooperation and has inspired the world\u2019s humanity to trust in the unity of purpose of its Member States in building peace and well-being for all people on earth.\nThroughout the past 75 years, the United Nations and its Member States have relentlessly overcome global challenges. This year, the world has been facing a health crisis from the spread of COVID-19 which has widely affected the living conditions of our people as well as economic and social systems \u2014 overshadowing the special nature of the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations. Indeed, this great challenge shall be the litmus test that faith in multilateralism and the unity of Member States can provide sustainable solutions to overcome this threat.\nTo do so, every country must renew its trust in international cooperation, which must remain steadfast and not be shaken by nationalist sentiments or antiglobalization tendencies. Instead, it should motivate us to unite as one to overcome this crisis together, since it has been proven that no nation can face the challenges alone. Such is the future we want.\nI take this opportunity to express Thailand\u2019s solidarity with all affected countries. We wish all the patients a speedy recovery, and to the medical personnel, public health workers, volunteers and other sectors around the globe who are at the forefront in the fight against COVID-19, we wish you success in this challenging mission, and please keep safe.\nMr. President,\nThe Royal Thai Government is committed and determined to control the spread of COVID-19. It has established the \u201cCentre for COVID-19 Situation Administration\u201d (CCSA) headed by myself to take full command in all aspects of pandemic control. Thailand\u2019s comprehensive measures in combatting COVID-19 are implemented in accordance with the International Health Regulations 2005 and the World Health Organization\u2019s guidelines. They encompass \u201cupstream, midstream to downstream\u201d measures including: health screening and risk assessment for all inbound and outbound travelers; the \u201cstay home, save lives for the nation\u201d campaign to apply social distancing in public spaces; and the provision of comprehensive, timely and transparent information on the pandemic situation while strengthening efforts to combat fake news and disinformation.\nOver 1 million Village Health Volunteers throughout the country have played a vital role and all patients, regardless of nationality, have been guaranteed equal access to medical treatment. Furthermore, the Royal Thai Government has also fully supported the strategy on COVID-19 vaccine development. Thailand has started its vaccine research programme since quite some time and has also fostered collaboration with international partners. In this regard, I urge that COVID-19 vaccines and medicines be considered as \u2018global public goods\u2019 which can be accessible to all. And the United Nations must play an important role in this matter.\nFurthermore, the Royal Thai Government has also introduced economic response packages to relieve the financial burden on the people and business operators, whether low-income groups, women entrepreneurs, farmers, or vulnerable groups and ensured that they are guaranteed equal access to government assistance. Efforts have focused on boosting financial liquidity for entrepreneurs so that they can sustain their businesses. In this regard, I have set up the \u201cCentre for Economic Situation Administration\u201d (CESA) to act as the main mechanism to formulate comprehensive policies for economic and social rehabilitation by synergizing efforts between the public and private sectors.\nAs a democratic society, Thailand places people at the centre. The people have provided the vital social synergy that helps drive the national agendas, integrating all the sectors in the country. With the cooperation and generosity of all Thai people in this time of crisis, the impacts of the outbreak have been minimized and the situation brought under control. And on this note, I wish to thank the World Health Organization for recognizing Thailand as one of the countries which has provided the most effective response to COVID-19. However, I continue to remind all sectors and the public not to underestimate the situation and to remain vigilant to prevent a second outbreak.\nThe key factor behind Thailand\u2019s achievement in pandemic control and role as a model of effective healthcare management has been the determined political will to develop a robust healthcare system through the Universal Health Coverage scheme. This recognises that a healthy population is an important force in driving national development towards security, prosperity and sustainability. In this regard, Thailand has been sharing our knowledge and experiences with interested countries through the Foreign Policy and Global Health (FPGH) initiative.\nIn this time of hardship, I trust that all countries will provide mutual support and exhibit solidarity at both regional and global levels. I commend the SecretaryGeneral for calling on Member States to show global solidarity in overcoming this crisis in a sustainable manner and for his initiative to establish various Funds to assist affected countries. Thailand is proud to have contributed to the \u201cUN COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund\u201d, while at the regional level, Thailand is gratified that the leaders of ASEAN and its Dialogue Partners agreed with Thailand\u2019s proposal to set up the \u201cCOVID-19 ASEAN Response Fund\u201d to address the public health emergency and to support research and development of medicines and vaccines to strengthen ASEAN\u2019s resilience in the long term. Indeed, a strong ASEAN will provide a good partner for the United Nations and the international community. Moreover, in order to prepare for the post-COVID scenario and to respond to other future challenges, Thailand stands ready to cooperate with all countries in other areas such as food and energy security as well as sustainable development.\nIn our efforts to revive the economy, Thailand launched the \u201cStop COVID, not the Thai economy\u201d policy and embraced the new business model of the \u201cBio- Circular-Green Economy\u201d or \u201cBCG\u201d which places emphasis on the Bioeconomy, the Circular economy, and the Green economy. Thailand has also applied the concept of the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP), recognized as a locally driven approach towards sustainability, building strength from within, connecting Thailand to the world, and moving forward leaving no one behind.\nMr. President,\nOn the occasion of the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations, we should take this opportunity to assess our previous successes and failures. Although the United Nations has not been able to solve all global problems we have faced, it has become clear that multilateralism that is inclusive can prevent large scale armed conflict, and protect the world from the arbitrary exercise of power. We should therefore commit to further strengthening the multilateral system and cooperation under the framework of the United Nations in order to respond to the changing world situation, new global challenges, and live up to the expectations of the new generation. And this is the United Nations that we desire, and the United Nations that we need.\nThroughout 75 years of our membership in the United Nations, Thailand has continuously and consistently played a constructive role, adhering to our international obligations and respecting the principles of the UN Charter.\nOn peace and security, for 75 years, the United Nations and the international community have been recognized for the success in peaceful dispute settlement, as well as in providing assistance to the population in post-conflict areas. On our part, apart from a strong commitment to disarmament, over 27,000 Thai military, police and civilian personnel have proudly served in more than 20 UN peace missions around the world since 1958. And Thailand\u2019s contribution to peace operations continues amidst the current pandemic crisis. The Thai peacekeepers have attached importance to the sustaining peace agenda and introduced the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP) as a development approach to address the root cause of conflict and prevent a recurrence, which is in line with SDG 16 (Peace, justice and strong institutions). Furthermore, I would like to reiterate our commitment to strengthening cooperation with friendly countries to enhance ASEAN\u2019s constructive role in maintaining peace and security in the region. On this occasion, I wish to thank Member States for supporting Thailand\u2019s candidature to be a member of the Peacebuilding Commission for the term 2021-2022 and wish to affirm that Thailand intends to discharge its duty as a member of the Commission for the benefit of the international community.\nOn development, we have ten years remaining to accelerate our actions to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is one key factor delaying such achievement. We must, therefore, work harder, cooperate closer and further promote the development path with people at the centre. We must also prioritize the participation of all stakeholders and emphasize utilizing technology for development.\nAs the co-host of the Global South-South Development Expo 2021 in Bangkok next year, together with the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, and as a member of the ECOSOC, we stand ready to share our experiences and best practices in sustainable development as guided by the principles of the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP).\nOn human rights, international agreements and instruments have established principles and obligations on the protection of human rights, the rule of law, and good governance, with the emphasis on vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, persons with disabilities, low-income earners, as well as migrant workers. It is therefore our responsibility to remain committed to these obligations and continuously ensure progress on implementation. As for Thailand, we are currently implementing the 4th National Human Rights Plan with a results-oriented mindset. I am also proud that Thailand is the first country in Asia to enact a National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights, which we have been implementing since 2019.\nThis year further marks the 25th anniversary of the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action on gender equality. For its part, Thailand continues to drive the implementation of the Beijing Declaration by integrating cross-cutting issues to realize gender equality, women\u2019s empowerment, and women\u2019s rights.\nCrisis necessarily brings suffering. But at the same time, it teaches us useful lessons that help us develop stronger and more effective responses to future challenges. What the \u201cnew normal\u201d and the future social landscape will look like does not depend solely on our generation, but also on the youth and the new generations. Together we must create a space for all generations to join hands in collaboration in order to plan for a future that we want.\nFinally, I take this opportunity to reaffirm Thailand\u2019s commitment to support the agendas of the United Nations, be they peace and security, development, climate change management, commitments to human rights, and the promotion of partnerships between various sectors. This is because multilateralism will guide us out of this crisis together, as it has done so throughout 75 years, for a future where peace prevails and a better world for this and for future generations.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "President of the General Assembly,\nExcellencies,\nLadies and gentlemen,\nAs the Assembly is a virtual event, I extend warm greetings to everyone at this difficult time amid the pandemic. We are united more than ever before in the spirit of solidarity.\nI welcome and congratulate Ambassador Volkan Bozkir on his election as President of the General Assembly and wish him success. I also welcome Secretary- General Antonio Guterres and thank him for his work.\nMr. President,\nThe coronavirus changed everyone\u2019s life, brought with it much pain and uncertainty, led to the loss of countless lives and put strong pressure on the health systems of all countries.\nI agree with German Chancellor Angela Merkel that it is the greatest challenge since the Second World War.\nThe health crisis also led to an economic crisis that destroyed jobs and caused debt and challenges in making payments. No country was prepared for it. That is why I believe that the multilateral financial institutions should redesign their strategies to promote economic recovery that is more humane, supportive and substantial.\nExcellencies,\nToday\u2019s world presents us with problems that cannot be addressed in isolation. That is why the deepening of multilateralism is an effective tool for responding to the needs we share, such as the quest for peace, the protection of human rights, the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, protection of the environment, the fight against climate change, and international trade based on principles and rules. We therefore underscore the importance of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as a road map that should guide us towards a more equitable world for future generations.\nLandlocked developing countries have special needs and particular challenges that must be addressed. In this regard, Paraguay stresses the importance of the effective implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action on this issue, in particular by transit countries.\nIn the spirit of integration that seeks to boost trade and achieve mutual benefits for economies and societies, Paraguay is committed to the early signing of the agreement between MERCOSUR and the European Union, as well as with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).\nLadies and gentlemen,\nI again endorse Paraguay\u2019s commitment to protecting life, family and human rights, as set out in our Constitution.\nTherefore, we strongly condemn terrorism and criminal groups that today use children and adolescents as human shields to protect themselves. They exploit and expose them to violence, indoctrinate them and train them in the use of weapons. Children, who should be in their homes, are used by criminals who resort to kidnapping, extortion and drug trafficking to support themselves. It leaves painful scars on our families. Paraguay is affected by it.\nThis leads me to underscore the duty to protect the inhabitants of my country from these criminal groups that seek to justify their illicit conduct with narratives camouflaged by ideology and supported by propaganda designed to distort the truth. Illegality is bold when covered up; it is very skilled in acquiring the attributes of good will and altruism, but Paraguay refuses to be deceived. We will not rest until the full weight of the law is brought to bear on them.\nThe doors of my country will remain open to international organizations offering to support us and verify our efforts.\nParaguay acts with transparency and remains committed to the law.\nMr. President,\nParaguay supports the reform of the Security Council to make it more inclusive and responsive to threats to international peace and security. We will also continue to contribute troops to peacekeeping operations, as we have done for decades.\nDistinguished delegates,\nThe Venezuelan diaspora is the second largest in the world. More than 5 million Venezuelans have been forced to emigrate to our countries. I again express my solidarity with the Venezuelan people as they continue to suffer. Paraguay will continue to support the international condemnation of human rights violations in Venezuela.\nBased on the principle of universality for which the Organization is known, we support Taiwan\u2019s request to be included in the United Nations system.\nWe also welcome the historic establishment of diplomatic relations between the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain and Israel, under the auspices of the United States of America. We hope that these new ties will contribute to peace and prosperity in the Middle East.\nExcellencies,\nOnly by working together to achieve our common purpose and build a modern international architecture and by rising to the occasion can we achieve the results that our people need and expect from us.\nI leave you with the words of His Holiness Pope Francis: \u201cWhen we emerge from this pandemic, we will no longer be able to do what we have been doing and how we have been doing it. No, everything will be different ... From the great trials of humanity, including the pandemic, we emerge either better or worse. We do not come out the same\u201d.\nMay our meeting, which demonstrates solidarity, be constant and help us to come out better."

We celebrate 75 years of the United Nations, 25 years of Fourth World Conference on Women but also of the Dayton-Paris Peace Agreement.\nAll these milestones in our collective history remind us how much we can achieve through joint action; how much it takes to make the world a better place.\nLet me first address the most pressing issue of our time.\nThe COVID-19 crisis represents a major stress test for the functioning of multilateralism, both regional and global, but also for bilateral co-operation among nations.\nNever in the history of our Organization had we had the General Assembly high level debate like this one.\nWe need no further evidence of the \u201cnew normal\u201d, of pivotal changes in our lives, than this one.\nWe are learning how to live with the pandemic and its consequences.\nResponse to this crisis should not lead to increased mistrust and isolationism in the international community.\nOn the contrary, it should forge our readiness to work together, in true spirit of solidarity and mutual support.\nTo win the battle against the pandemic requires responsible and inclusive governance, close cooperation and pooling of our resources in order to strengthen our stressed health systems, save lives, jobs and livelihoods.\nSynergies at regional, international, and global levels are essential to cope with the medical and socio-economic effects of the crisis.\nThis is an important lesson and we need to raise our awareness and preparedness in the coming months until a successful, effective vaccine is developed.\nThe vaccine must be available to as many as possible and we should spare no effort to make it so.\nCroatia welcomes the General Assembly resolution on a \u2018Comprehensive and coordinated response to the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019, adopted in this Assembly with an overwhelming support.\nThis resolution clearly demonstrates the need for a global joint approach in addressing the impacts and consequences of the pandemic.\nMobilizing the political will and financial resources is the most effective response against the pandemic.\nThe European Union demonstrated this in the best way in July, through its European Council conclusions.\nCroatia recognizes the pivotal role of the World Health Organization.\nWe emphasize in particular the importance to elevate the vaccine against COVID 19 to the status of a global public good.\nWe need to continue the review of WHO performance as well as inclusive conversation about the strengthening of the WHO and its financing and potential steps of reform.\nMr President,\nThe economic recovery from the crisis and the strengthening of our healthcare systems was in the focus of the Croatian Presidency of the Council of the European Union in the first half of 2020.\nToday, almost three months after the end of our Presidency, while the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing, the motto of our Presidency \u2014 \u201cA strong Europe in a world of challenges\u201d \u2014 proved to be well chosen and relevant as ever.\nLet me add that in addition to the COVID-19 crisis, Croatia is dealing with the consequences of a devastating earthquake that hit Zagreb on 22 March.\nI use the opportunity to thank all world leaders who sent us words of solidarity and extended their support.\nThe unprecedented circumstances we live in represent a unique opportunity for us to rethink the global role of multilateralism and strengthen the importance of orderly globalization and a rules-based international order.\nWhile protecting the well-being of our citizens, it is all the more important that, at a challenging time like this, we continue to respect and uphold the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the international law and the rule of law.\nCroatia recognizes that a human rights-based approach is the only way forward to guarantee a response where no one is left behind.\nMr President,\nNo organization is better placed than the United Nations for global delivery of the goals of international cooperation; therefore, we must support our Organization, financially and politically.\nTo deliver on its commitment of solidarity Croatia participates in the \u201cTeam Europe\u201d, a global response package worth 36 billion euros.\nThis will help support partner countries in their fight against COVID-19.\nWe firmly support the United Nations\u2019 Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP) and its programs as a coordinated approach to finding multilateral solutions in this crisis.\nCroatia contributed 400.000 euros to the UN COVID-19 Response and Recovery Multi-Partner Trust Fund.\nIn addition, we are supporting the WHO efforts with a 600.000 euros contribution.\nMr President,\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed the work and activities of all the governments around the world.\nCroatia being a well-known tourist destination, is carefully accomplishing a proper balance between the health of our citizens and the opening of tourist season in order to preserve jobs and to help the tourist industry and our economy.\nOur common work on the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Climate Agreement and internationally agreed biodiversity goals will be crucial to face the inevitable systemic shocks in the future.\nThe EU has already committed to transform its economy and society to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.\nWe see sustainable, climate-neutral growth as an essential element of the future not just of Europe, but of the entire world.\nWe also must preserve multilateralism in trade in order to keep global value chains unobstructed, ensure the effective trade of goods and services, and in particular the medical products.\nSmart digitalization proved to be one of the backbones of the functioning of our societies during the height of the pandemic, as many businesses and services, including in the public sector, switched predominantly or entirely to the digital sphere.\nWe need a secure digital infrastructure as well as an eco-friendly Internet, since the ICT industry uses already over 10% of all electricity \u2014 which is more than the energy produced by all world\u2019s nuclear power plants together \u2014 and this share is growing at an exponential rate.\nTherefore, to make the digital economy sustainable and avoid that it poses new challenges in the future, we need additional investments in this area, while favouring the use of renewable energies, as well as an adequate legal framework regulating this ever more important field.\nUnfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has also opened the door for the spread of another insidious but less obvious pandemic.\nThe emergence and convergence of different groups and phenomena that thrive on fake news, trolling, deliberate disinformation, media illiteracy and general ignorance is a cause for serious concern.\nParticularly appalling have been the cyber-attacks against the health institutions fighting the pandemic.\nUnfortunately, there is no quick fix. There can be no curative vaccine against fake news.\nIn this respect, we welcome the growing responsible approach by major tech companies and media outlets.\nYet, much more needs to be done, and both public and private actors need to cooperate in this endeavour in order to allow societies to build resilience against hybrid threats and cyber-attacks.\nWe must also not forget about the threats and dangers such as terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but also corruption and trafficking of illegal drugs.\nThese topics must not escape our attention.\nMr President,\nAnother important anniversary we commemorate this year is the field of arms control, and that is the 50th anniversary of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), our valued multilateral instrument for preventing nuclear proliferation and achieving nuclear disarmament.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to postpone the 2020 NPT Conference to a later date.\nConsidering that the 2015 Review conference failed to reach a consensus on a substantive final declaration, it is of high importance to have a successful Conference this time, hopefully no later than April next year.\nIt is also essential not to ignore the threat posed by the illegal trade and misuse of small arms and light weapons.\nCroatia holds the 2020 Plenary Chair of the Wassenaar Arrangement, the first worldwide mechanism on export controls for conventional weapons and sensitive dual-use goods and technologies.\nWe shall continue to advocate the increasing importance of effective multilateral action on tackling illegal arms transfer and build-up.\nI am proud that for the first time ever Croatia has a candidate for the judge of the International Court of Justice.\nIn the upcoming elections this fall, our candidate is Mrs Maja Sersic, Professor of International Law and Vice-Dean for International Cooperation of the University of Zagreb\u2019s Faculty of Law.\nBesides her proven professional qualities, we believe that her election would also be important for achieving a better gender balance and a fairer participation of States within the Court\u2019s composition.\nIn my speech on Monday, on the occasion of the UN 75th anniversary, I stressed the need for United Nations reform.\nWe need the UN fit for the 21st century.\nFor that we have to continue with its reforms and in this endeavour no stone should be left unturned, including the UN Charter.\nOur Organization has to maintain its core values and principles on which it has been founded, but it must also reflect realties and needs of our times.\nIn addition, we are convinced that our shared values will be better preserved and advanced through the close cooperation between the United Nations and other multilateral organizations such as the Council of Europe and the OSCE as well as NATO.\nChanges at the global stage are becoming more rapid and deeper. They affect us all by posing challenges that require a global response. For this, we will have to invest more in solidarity and partnerships.\nWe understand that new geopolitical confrontations will frame the period to come.\nAgainst this background we should invest more in dialogue while at the same time reaffirming our allegiance towards multilateral solutions, observance of international law and established norms.\nIn a globalized world we need a multilateralism that will be to the benefit of all and not just to some.\nThe pandemic could exacerbate further existing regional conflicts and global security challenges.\nTherefore, Croatia fully supports Secretary General\u2019s call for a global cease-fire.\nMr President,\nAs I mentioned earlier, some of this year\u2019s anniversaries refer to South-East Europe.\n25 years ago, the Dayton-Paris Peace Agreement was signed. It put an end to the bloodiest war in Europe since the Second World War, the one in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nMeanwhile, this part of Europe has profoundly changed for the better, but some problems still prevail and merit our full attention.\nCroatia, as one of the parties to the agreement, considers that the Dayton-Paris Peace Agreement anniversary should be used to reflect on its achievements, but also on the contemporary situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina with a view to putting this important country firmly on its European path.\nCroatia, being a neighbour and a friend of this country, has a keen interest in stability and prosperity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, all its constituent peoples and all tis citizens.\nFull equality of Croats, as one of three constituent peoples in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and their well-being, remains our high priority. Especially their legitimate representation in the institutions through adequate electoral law preventing any electoral engineering.\n20 years ago was held the Zagreb Summit.\nIt confirmed the European perspective of South-East Europe for the first time and opened the way to EU membership of the countries of the region.\nIn May this year, Croatia hosted the second Zagreb Summit at which the EU reaffirmed its unequivocal support for the European perspective of the countries of the Western Balkans.\nThe European perspective of the Western Balkan states has been a key driver for political and economic reforms in the region and has significantly contributed to peace, democracy, prosperity and security in Europe.\nLooking back, much has been achieved, much has changed for the better. Looking ahead, for the stability of the region, sincere reconciliation is essential.\nThis can only be built on truth and grounded in facts, in conjunction with finding all remaining missing people and rendering justice for all the victims.\nMr President,\nToday many of our citizens look with anxiousness to the future.\nUncertainties are many, from unpredictability of markets, to the perils of global climate change, which will be the challenge of this century.\nIn view of the fact that the oceans play a central role in regulating the Earth\u2019s climate, we cannot ignore that the past five years hold the highest record for global ocean temperatures.\nAs a consequence, while the sea level has not changed over the last two millennia, it has already risen about twenty centimetres since 1900 and it is accelerating at an alarming rate, threatening many of our coastal areas and cities.\nOcean plastic pollution is also unfolding at an alarming rate. Between 8 to 14 million tons of plastics end in the world\u2019s oceans and seas every year.\nWe can no longer stand by, shrug our shoulders and close our eyes to that grim reality.\nYet this is only one of the many side effects of global warming that ring the alarm bells for our planet and it if we do not act now the damage will become irreparable.\nOur citizens are counting on us, the world leaders, to deliver on the promises of a better tomorrow for them and their children.\nLet us therefore unite as nations and assume our responsibility to create a healthier, equal and more sustainable world for the generations to come.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President, Majesties,\nLadies and Gentlemen Heads of State and Government,\nLadies and Gentlemen Heads of Delegation, Mr. Secretary-General, Ladies and Gentlemen,\nMr. President,\nAllow me at the outset of my remarks to extend my warm congratulations to you on your brilliant election as President of this 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly.\nI see it as powerful testimony to the influence of your country\u2019s diplomacy and the high esteem in which it is held by the international community.\nI can assure you of Gabon\u2019s full support throughout your mandate.\nI would like to commend the work accomplished by your predecessor, Professor Tijjani Muhammad Bande, who, amid a particularly difficult global health context, was able to mobilize our countries\u2019 efforts in carrying out our agenda.\nI also express my appreciation to the Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, for the work carried out in strengthening the effectiveness of our Organization and his commitment to implementing the structural reforms underway at the UN.\nMr. President,\nThe world today is at a turning point in its history. We are indeed in the middle of an unprecedented health crisis, which is destroying our societies and taking its toll on every nation.\nIn fact, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to exacerbating the political, security and socioeconomic challenges regularly faced by States.\nSo we must learn the lessons from this multifaceted crisis.\nOne of the key observations apparent to us from the very beginning is our interdependence in the face of any threat to the chain of humanity in which we are all interlinked.\nIt reminds us that the only way to salvation is multilateralism and greater international solidarity.\nIn the light of this reality, the Founding Fathers of our Organization built the conceptual bedrock of collective security that is at the heart of the United Nations Charter.\nOne aspect emerging from the current crisis is the insufficiency of a normative framework in confronting the global challenges facing our world.\nSo, we should reinvent ourselves and act more effectively so as to contain transnational and cross-border threats such as the current pandemic.\nAs our family of Nations celebrates the 75-year existence of the UN, our shared home, we must live up to the values and ideals that guided its creation.\nThis is the perfect setting to welcome the important Declaration adopted on the occasion of the commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the UN.\nThis reflects the scale of the task before us and the scope of the commitments to be undertaken to ensure no one is left behind.\nMr. President,\nThe theme of our work is particularly relevant and timely. \u201cThe future we want, the United Nations we need: reaffirming our commitment to multilateralism\u201d are indeed powerful words that call on our respective consciences.\nIndeed, Nations operating individually cannot protect themselves from climate change, tensions associated with trade competition, growing inequalities and the increase in terrorist attacks and acts of transnational crime.\n\u201cThe world in which we live\u201d therefore requires a multilateral system that promotes cooperation for the benefit of all and a pooling of our efforts.\nIn this regard, the reform of the UN Security Council, including equitable representation within it and an improvement in its working methods, has emerged as a necessity and even a critical imperative.\nGabon, through me, remains fundamentally committed to the African common position, as expressed by the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.\nAlong with greater international solidarity and the reform of the UN Security Council, the revitalization of the work of the General Assembly as well as the reform of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) must also be carried out in order to stimulate a new dynamic in our Organization.\nMr. President,\n\u201cThe United Nations we need\u201d is also dependent on a redefinition of the missions assigned to the Bretton Woods Institutions, in order to make them real engines of development and global growth.\nThese reforms are essential for the emergence of a fairer international order promoting all of our best interests, as they impact our ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, including by responding to the legitimate aspirations of the African peoples as contained in Agenda 2063.\nMr. President,\n\u201cThe United Nations has a natural vocation\u201d to be a response of the Peoples of the world in the face of threats to their aspirations for dignity, peace and prosperity.\nThe United Nations must therefore be humanity\u2019s response against fatality and injustice.\nThe need for action to ensure a more just and equitable multilateral system bears the upshot of stabilizing the prices of raw materials, which are subject to excessive speculation.\nThis is a source of instability that is difficult to reconcile with the predictability of mobilizable resources, which our countries desperately need to be able to achieve their development objectives.\nIn the same vein, more equitable justice would undoubtedly consist in paying countries that possess raw materials a price that is fair for their natural resources.\n\u201cThe future we want\u201d also requires honouring commitments made.\nHere I should like to reiterate the urgency that we solidify the commitments made in favour of developing countries.\nWhether it be in terms of transferring clean technologies or improving people\u2019s access to renewable energy.\nFor us, this involves transitioning from a traditional polluting industry to a low-carbon, environmentally friendly industry.\nFor Gabon, this is based on a foundation made up of three pillars: improved living conditions, the implementation of projects to adapt to climate change and the preservation of biodiversity.\nMr. President,\nDevelopment cannot be sustainable without peace, security and stability. Unfortunately, these fundamentals continue to be challenged in many parts of the world.\nRecurrent terrorist attacks have shown that no nation is immune to this scourge, which is why our response must be based on frank cooperation at the local, national, regional and global levels.\nThrough my voice and in solidarity with the international community, Gabon clearly condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and supports the countries and peoples who fall victim to it.\nMr. President,\nThe price of instability, combined with the effects of terrorism, hotbeds of tension and multifaceted destabilization, is particularly heavy for many African countries.\nIndeed, they are forced to devote significant resources to tackling these phenomena, which are fuelled, inter alia, by the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and the trafficking of species of wild fauna and flora.\nIt is clear to me that in the fight against these sources of instability and fragility in several regions across our Continent, a global and united approach is essential since \u201cany threat to a Nation naturally constitutes a threat to all\u201d.\nIn this regard, we remain resolutely committed alongside the United Nations, the African Union, as well as within the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), to working to promote stability and peace in our States.\nMr. President,\nAt the regional level, I received a mandate from my peers to lead the Institutional Reform of ECCAS, to make our Community more efficient so as to tackle the challenges it was created to deal with, in particular those relating to Regional Integration and Development.\nOn 28 July 2020, the Conference of Heads of State and Government of ECCAS adopted a new nomenclature to reflect the major challenges of the time, notably peace, security and development.\nTo this end, ECCAS\u2019 revised Treaty entered into force on 28 August 2020, and the ECCAS Commission, the new Executive Body of our Community Organization, was established on 31 August 2020, with all of its members having taken an oath.\nDuring its 17th Ordinary Summit, ECCAS adopted a community action Plan for the implementation of United Nations Resolution 1325, including the community\u2019s strategy in response to COVID-19.\nIt also harmonized a set of rules relating to telecommunications, information and communication technologies, cybersecurity and cross-border interconnection.\nMr. President,\nAt the national level, Gabon, like many countries, has suffered the impact of the drastic fall in commodity prices, exacerbated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 a situation that has led to the slowdown of its economic activity.\nIn this context, my country has pursued reforms in order to offset the imbalances through economic stimulus measures earmarked for fiscal adjustment, infrastructure development and supporting the private sector as levers for diversifying and transforming our country\u2019s economy.\nToday, we welcome the promising signs that are emerging following the implementation of our Economic Recovery Plan.\nIndeed, thanks to the return to economic growth driven by these reforms, Gabon is gradually regaining room for manoeuvre.\nThese are necessary so as to finance the most urgent areas of investment, particularly in health care, education, training, employment and infrastructure.\nMr. President,\nInclusion is a major concern in my country\u2019s political direction.\nThis is the aim of the political programme for \u201cequal opportunities\u201d that I am promoting in favour of more just and equitable development, enhancing the value of women, young people and the most vulnerable so that no one be left on the margins of my country\u2019s development.\nIn this spirit, I recently appointed a woman to the post of Prime Minister, Head of Government.\nAs a result, three ladies of utmost value, among many good women, now hold very high responsibilities at the highest level of the State.\nThis is the case notably at the Constitutional Court, the Senate and the Office of the Prime Minister. They make an invaluable contribution to consolidating our democratic gains and our march towards progress.\nMr. President,\n\u201cThe future we want and the UN we need\u201d will remain mere unfulfilled wishes while so many people and human beings continue to be burdened with unfair and often unjust sanctions.\nIn this regard, I would like to reiterate the solemn call for the complete lifting of the embargo that has been affecting Cuba for several decades, in order to enable this country to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.\nI cannot conclude my remarks without reaffirming Gabon\u2019s commitment to multilateralism, which is the only way forward in our legitimate quest for a secure future, and in our common ambition to build an Organization capable of meeting the complex challenges of sustainable development.\nUltimately, an Organization that finds appropriate and lasting solutions to the challenges and threats facing humanity.\nThank you."

        "file_text": "Mr. President of the General Assembly,\nMr. Secretary-General,\nLadies and Gentlemen Heads of State and Government,\nExcellencies,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nThe particular circumstances of the general debate at this 75th session of the General Assembly are anecdotal when, for months, families, communities and countries have been caught up in the turmoil of the Covid-19 pandemic and its consequences.\nI would like to commend here the leadership of His Excellency Professor Tijjani Muhammad Bande. He was able to stay the course in particularly difficult times and allow the General Assembly to pursue the crux of its work.\nI would also like to warmly thank the Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, and through him all the United Nations staff, who have never ceased to mobilize the United Nations system even in areas of conflict in order to protect the most vulnerable.\nDevelopment activity reforms have enabled the effective coordination of teams on the ground and highlighted the skills, dedication and courage of those women and men who work on a daily basis to honour the mandates we have entrusted to them.\nMr. President Bozkir, you have given pre-eminence to consultation and coordination, so that member States can stand up to the immense challenges in a spirit of mutual aid and efficiency.\nYou know that you can count on the full cooperation of my delegation as the Principality of Monaco assumes one of the Presidencies of this 75th session.\nMr. President,\nIn recent years, the world has endured a succession of crises that we have had to confront in this forum: the rise of terrorism, the intensification of migratory flows, climatic shifts, the financial crisis of 2008 and now the pandemic that is generating an economic and social crisis.\nDespite these major obstacles, we have adopted innovative guidelines: the 2030 Agenda for development and its SDGs in 2015, as well as the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2016 and the global Compact for safe migration in 2018, to name just a few.\nThe international system is nevertheless destabilized and multilateralism is being called into question. In a context where nationalist and protectionist tendencies are resurgent, it is vital that we mobilize in a coordinated and united manner.\nNo State, regardless of size or military or economic power, can meet the current international challenges on its own.\nThe interconnectedness of our States demands a coordinated response to transnational threats that undermine hard-won progress and weaken international peace and security.\nThe sudden shutdown imposed on our economies by the necessary lockdown has impacted our resources.\nMonaco, resolutely committed to multilateralism and its institutions, has fulfilled its statutory commitments and will continue to comply with its obligations. Faithful to its tradition of solidarity with the most vulnerable, the Principality has consequently joined in the collective effort to fight the pandemic, in particular by responding to the global emergency plea launched by the United Nations.\nMr. President,\nThe Secretary-General has called for building a multilateralism of networks by bringing together all agencies, organizations and entities at the local, regional and international level. It is indeed by being more inclusive, listening to all, that we can be assured \u201cof leaving no one behind\u201d.\nAs such, women and girls can no longer be excluded from such a movement in this year marked by a triple anniversary: 25 years of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, 20 years since the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 on \u201cWomen, Peace and Security\u201d and 10 years since the creation of UN Women.\nThat means equality between women and men has been on our agenda for 25 years and yet women and girls are still the main group affected by inequalities.\nDespite some progress, the situation in the world is changing extremely slowly.\nMoreover, the 2020 report on the sustainable development Goals underscores the heavy toll women are paying in the face of the crisis, making the achievement of SDG 5 increasingly distant.\nIt is women who are most involved in the fight against COVID-19 and therefore the most exposed to contamination, and at the same time, a strong and intolerable increase in cases of domestic violence is to be deplored, as well as a particularly high school dropout rate for girls.\nMy Government is resolutely committed to defending the interests of women and will continue its efforts, through the Committee for the Promotion and Protection of Women\u2019s Rights, created in 2018, to reduce inequalities and fight against discrimination and violence, of which women are still too often the victims.\nIt is also by listening to and trusting young people that we will build a more robust and sustainable future.\nPolitical inclusion is a central demand of youth. Over the past year, many of us have praised the commitment that young people have shown on the climate issue.\nToday, although young people are less affected by the COVID-19 virus, it is they who are bearing the full brunt of the resulting economic crisis. Many of them are affected by precarious status that does not provide them with social protection. Others find themselves cut off from any means of access to education. It is essential that we establish specific provisions in order to prevent our young people from finding themselves permanently stuck in the poverty trap.\nMr. President,\nWhile new technologies have largely contributed to the development of our societies, they have unfortunately contributed to the rise of a new context of insecurity. The past few months have accelerated the digital transition on a tremendous scale, but these advances have also been accompanied by an explosion of cyberattacks.\nCyberspace is now an area of conflict in its own right, just like the land, sea and sky.\nWhat becomes of sovereignty in the digital age, when security, law, the economy, taxation and currency are called into question? In my view, it is important to agree on common rules in order to adopt a framework of appropriate measures and proper conduct. That is not only to guarantee a better functioning of our institutions, but also to ensure the preservation of States\u2019 sovereignty and individual freedoms.\nAt the same time, the wave of disinformation has intensified, particularly via social media in recent months. Our societies are vulnerable to these manoeuvres. Also, I welcome the awareness campaign launched by the United Nations to combat fake news.\nMonaco has undertaken to acquire strong digital skills, on the one hand, to seize the many opportunities offered by digital technology in economic and environmental spheres and, on the other hand, to ensure sustainable development that is respectful of people.\nTherefore, the responsible and sustainable digital model that I wanted for my country is accompanied not only by significant investments in infrastructure, training and business support, but also by the enactment of legislative rules.\nMr. President,\nWe cannot discuss this new context of insecurity without mentioning the gravity of the climate crisis. Large-scale natural disasters will intensify and, as we know, cause emergency humanitarian situations and the displacement of populations. These disasters will have an impact on access to natural resources. These phenomena are vectors of political instability and conflict.\nThe current pandemic has demonstrated how vulnerable we are when we destroy the planet\u2019s ecosystems. Scientists are clear on this, and we should expect an increased risk of these types of epidemics if we do not change our behaviour.\nThe slowdown in our activities as a result of the pandemic has not changed the curve of rising temperatures nor reduced nature\u2019s destruction.\nMeanwhile, the postponement of major environmental meetings does not mean indefinitely suspending our commitments but calls instead for a redoubling of our efforts. The urgency is still there and, more than ever, it is necessary for us all to mobilize.\nIn this regard, I would like to commend the Secretary-General\u2019s initiative to convene a Biodiversity Summit, thereby granting it its rightful place at the heart of our political agenda. The collective decision to go ahead with the event on 30 September, despite the current health context, confirms this commitment to which I fully subscribe.\nMonaco is, and shall remain, resolutely committed to environmental protection and sustainable development. Whether by pursuing the energy transition, accelerating the development of soft mobility, or promoting the circular economy, the Principality has placed the development of consumption and production methods at the heart of its vision of society. Each aspect of the Monegasque Government\u2019s action must form part of the demands of sustainable development. This is the line that I set for it in 2005.\nMr. President,\nWhile the current crisis has focused much of our global attention on growth figures and economic recovery, there is a significant risk that we will deviate from the other pillars of sustainable development.\nIt is therefore essential that we seize the opportunity before us to rethink our economic and social models based on principles that respect the environment.\nNow more than ever, the road map that we established in 2015 must guide us during this period of great uncertainty. Now more than ever, the COVID-19 pandemic is demonstrating that it is crucial to achieve the goals defined by the 2030 Agenda for development, the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.\nTo do this, greater ambition and mobilization are necessary, not only to defeat COVID-19 but also to adapt our multilateral cooperation instruments.\nThe period of social distancing we are currently living through should prompt us to echo the message \u201cTo leave no one behind\u201d that we placed at the heart of the SDGs and the opening words of the Preamble of the United Nations Charter \u201cWe, the peoples of the United Nations\u201d, so as to increase our solidarity.\nThank you for your attention."

        "file_text": "Mr. President,\nMr. Secretary General,\nYour Excellencies,\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nI would like to start my intervention by congratulating His Excellency Mr. Volkan Bozkir on his election as President of the General Assembly, and I would also like to congratulate the Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, and the Secretariat of the United Nations. The celebration of the 75th anniversary of the United Nations and of this great Assembly of all the peoples of the world, which was created with the primary objective of constructing multilateralism as way of implementing a system of values and a code of conduct based on cooperation, will undoubtedly be remembered as the year that the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic shook the very pillars of our societies.\nThe magnitude of this public health emergency has required an unprecedented mobilization of resources. Governments and institutions, civil and social organizations have all invested great energy in the fight against COVID-19. However, the first response and the most heroic efforts have come from all our health professionals. Therefore, I would like to take advantage of this general debate at the United Nations to vindicate their work. Not only have they demonstrated their professional value, but they have also shown their immense human quality, because, unfortunately, this virus has often deprived us of contact and the accompaniment of persons near to us, who are so necessary in moments of difficulty. However, in spite of all, the men and women of the health services have provided constant support to the people and families that have had to live through such adversity.\nAll of our countries are suffering the consequences of this pandemic; the virus knows no borders. I want to pass on my affection and extend my sympathy to all those families that have unfortunately lost loved ones.\nIn 1945, the United Nations emerged from the ruins of the most devastating war in history. The organization has led the way in tackling universal challenges and created an institutional framework that has made significant progress in areas of such importance as human rights, poverty eradication, the consolidation of democratic institutions, the fight against climate change and the promotion of sustainable development, and it has also provided protection for the most vulnerable in armed conflicts. Thanks to multilateralism, the United Nations has often been able to reach areas where traditional diplomacy has not. Even at times such as the present one, in which the pandemic has exposed the weaknesses of States, the United Nations has continued to see cooperation as an antidote to confrontation. From this perspective, I would like to highlight the work that the organization has carried out, especially under its Secretary General, within a context as fragile as the present situation which, unfortunately, shares many common points with the scenario that led to the founding of the United Nations.\nOn 23 March, the Secretary General called for a ceasefire to put an end to all hostilities throughout the world, and he asked us to join forces against this pandemic and to facilitate the work of humanitarians. \u201cThe fury of the virus illustrates the folly of war... Silence the guns... Let us take inspiration from the coalitions and dialogue slowly taking shape among rival parties to enable joint approaches to COVID-19\u201d, Mr. Antonio Guterres urged. This was an appeal to our good sense which we hope will be permanent, and Andorra aligns itself fully with his call.\nIn a similar way, the United Nations has spared no effort in planning and offering a response to help pave the way for the recovery of those countries where the pandemic has wreaked most havoc, those countries where the massive destruction of broad sectors of the economy will be long-lasting. This response must underpin a more sustainable and inclusive type of development that leaves nobody behind.\nThe United Nations has continued to broaden its sphere of action in recent years: ranging from improvements to people\u2019s living conditions to development-related matters that have become key elements of the multilateral agenda. Development has been viewed as a formula to eradicate poverty, to fight against inequality and injustice, and to initiate climate action. It is clear that the pandemic has worsened the situation, but it must also serve as an incentive to push for a paradigm change, and the Government of Andorra is convinced that now is the right moment to build a better and greener world, both at a national level, by approaching sustainability in a transversal manner and as a main line of political action, and at an international level within the area of cooperation; because the world must be sustainable or it will cease to be.\nThis requires the involvement of everybody, public authorities, civil society and private initiative, science and knowledge, all inspired by the Sustainable Development Goals and the principles of Human Rights that should lie at the core of all our actions.\nIn specific terms, the world cannot be sustainable, nor can there be sustained growth without the active participation of women at every level. It is now twenty-five years since the Beijing Platform was adopted, and many elements still need to be built on that base. We can no longer tolerate the vulnerabilities endured by women, which have been exacerbated by the pandemic, ranging from the violence they suffer to discrimination in basic rights such as access to health and education. We must use all the means that are necessary to prevent the global disorder caused by COVID-19 from being used to roll back rights. We need to move forward with agendas that are not regressive for women. Now is the time; this is our opportunity to give full meaning to the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the most ambitious plan for the promotion of women\u2019s rights established thus far. And, accordingly, we must take advantage of this moment to rebuild and approach this crisis from a gender perspective whereby all women and girls can exercise their freedoms, realize their rights and participate in decision-making.\nOn the other hand, when rebuilding after COVID-19, children must be protected in all governmental actions, and especially within the area of education, understood as the fundamental, universal and indivisible right that it is. Surely, there is no better weapon to help overcome discrimination and prejudice than to make sure that all our children have access to education. This education should take the form of training inspired by the principles of human rights, diversity and integration, and respect for and alignment with nature. We need to understand that the function of education is a responsibility of society as a whole, a responsibility of all adults who live and interact with our children and young people.\nThere are many situations that need to be considered and observed in a transversal manner; gender equality, attention to children and young people, the participation and protection of the elderly, non-discrimination of people with disabilities. The realities of the present, the uncertainties of the future and the experience of the past have shown us the need to teach values and invest our efforts to ensure that schools are able to apply themselves to meeting increasingly greater demands. The success of our societies is based on this growth in human capital through education and training.\nOnce again, I would like to reaffirm my country\u2019s commitment to the international community as we all seek to build up the momentum that is necessary to promote quality education as a mechanism for guaranteeing equal opportunities.\nMr. President,\nThe fight against climate change continues to be one of the priorities of Andorra, a country with a special awareness of the natural environment. This year was to be a significant year for climate action through the plan for a new scenario of understanding, marked by the ratification of new objectives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, within the framework of the Climate Change Conference COP26 that was to be held in the United Kingdom. Andorra approved the Paris Agreement of 2015 without any doubt or hesitation, and we passed a law on Energy Transition and the Fight against Climate Change that reflects our contribution to the Paris Agreement. Indeed, we were one of the first countries to establish a plan to reduce emissions because we have experience in working towards becoming a sustainable country since we are aware that we must preserve our resources and our natural environment for future generations. For this reason, we will spare no effort in the fight against climate change.\nAnother action that removes any doubt there may be about our conviction and our commitment to the fight against climate change in all its areas is the role we have been playing heading the Pro Tempore Secretariat of the Ibero-American Summit for a period of two years under the motto \u201cInnovation for Sustainable Development- Objective 2030\u201d. The joint declaration adopted by the Environment Ministers at the Environment Conference on 16 September last, is one of the high points of our presidency and it will allow us to build an environmental agenda among the 22 Member States of the Ibero-American Conference.\nThe crisis triggered by COVID-19 is having a profound impact on the daily lives of many families, and our country is no exception. The sense of responsibility and duty that we feel towards our fellow citizens has led the Government of Andorra to review the road map envisaged by this legislature, and we have developed an action plan based on our conviction that the decisions we make must increase the potential of our country as it moves towards the development and preservation of sustainability in the medium and long term.\nThis realistic plan builds on the strengths of our country, such as our health and social protection system, the educational model and the country\u2019s high level of public safety, its historical uniqueness, cultural diversity and privileged natural environment. However, the plan also identifies, as one would expect, some aspects that need to be improved and this is based on our belief that sustainability \u2014 understood in the transversal sense \u2014 has to be the main guiding line of any political action. For this reason, we have developed a roadmap because we are aware that the impact of any actions taken at this moment will have an effect that will endure way beyond the present time. All these actions are in line with the Sustainable Development Goals, because as government institutions we must be the main catalysts of the change that is being promoted from the United Nations.\nThese initiatives are supported by three pillars: welfare and cohesion, economics and innovation, and alliances for change, and we want to achieve these with transparency, participation, proximity, efficiency and equality.\nYour Excellencies,\nThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has forced us into unimaginable situations. The world was brought to a sudden halt only a few weeks after the first victim of COVID-19 was announced: schools, factories, offices, roads, stadia etc. all felt silent in order to fight an invisible enemy and this also allowed us see that the world would never be the same again.\nWe have seen digitalization take giant steps in a matter of weeks, and we have also seen how teleworking has become the norm and education non-presential, obliging millions of people to become technologically literate. But we have also seen cracks appear in this process; we have had to reconsider some of the values of our system of caring for the elderly, who have been the main victims of this virus; we must remember that teleworking does not bring a better work-life balance when home spaces are not appropriate or adequate; we have seen how distance learning has highlighted deep inequalities among families that cannot access services, and we have suffered an overexposure to information which, apart from reducing human contact, has sometimes created manipulable and unsafe environments.\nBut there is also hope, because, more than ever, we have seen a flourishing of values such as solidarity and empathy, sincere recognition of all our health and healthcare professionals, a sense of civility and the responsibility of the population in favor of the common interest, as well as an increased ecological awareness.\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nToday, in the year that we are commemorating the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, Andorra wants to add its voice to those that support an organization that represents the very essence of multilateralism, and which in recent years has managed to preserve its initial spirit while evolving at the same time. Now, more than ever, we must appeal to and recognize the spirit and vision of the UN\u2019s founders, who were able to overcome the obstacles of a terrible war as well as difference of opinions in order to preserve mankind.\nFar from being an ideal world, we know we must face up to challenges such as the persistence of conflicts that have still not been resolved, bloody scenarios, an imbalanced world from which poverty has not disappeared, where famine is on the increase, where access to health is not universal and where climate change is the clearest sign of structural deficiencies; in short, a world where the Universal Declaration of Human Rights has several readings and applications. But we must pull together to revert this situation, and work from an open, integrated, participative and inclusive position such as that created by multilateral organizations.\nWe need to make progress in many areas. We already know where we want to go, but getting there is always the most complicated part. This is why we want to recognize the work carried out by the Secretary General in reforming the development system, and the contributions that States have made to the resolutions and proposals for improvement. However, it is undeniable that we have no time to lose, and we must build up our knowledge about procedures and work with experts in efficiency if we want to respond to our commitment to the Charter and obtain the results of peace and security, rights and development.\nAndorra would like to use this Assembly to firmly reiterate its commitment to the United Nations, its agencies and multilateralism, to cooperation, inclusion and the solutions that this unique organization offers us. Its values all come together in the form of solidarity as a way to help us overcome a phase of humanity that is still full of uncertainties.\nNow more than ever, our country, true to its record of commitment to peace, stands beside the United Nations as it seeks to reshape a multilateral order that can help us meet the remaining challenges and deal with any possible changes, and we see this health crisis as an opportunity to put an end to a model of development and unsustainable globalization that has run its course.\nNow is the moment to make sure that solidarity can prevail in all its aspects. Seventy-five years on, we need to be more aware than ever of the spirit that led to the birth of the United Nations.\nThank you very much."

        "file_text": "In the name of Allah, the most gracious, the most merciful Peace, mercy, and blessings of God\nMr. President, we would like, at the beginning, to congratulate you on your election as President of the General Assembly for its current session, and we wish you success in managing its work.\nWe also thank the previous President for his efforts in conducting the work of the last session with great efficiency and skill.\nIt is a pleasure to join you in celebrating the seventy-fifth Anniversary of the United Nations, which over the past decades has contributed to the reinforcement of international cooperation and preservation of world peace for the benefit of all mankind.\nWe are also pleased to commend the tireless efforts of His Excellency the Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, in strengthening the role of the Organization, settling disputes and proposing solutions and initiatives, in order to reach a global order based on consolidation and protection of human rights, and the achievement of the highest levels of development with equality and full participation of all the member states of this esteemed international system.\nIn this context, the Kingdom of Bahrain stresses its adherence to and respect for its international obligations, as represented in preserving the strength and stability of the international system and the continuation of its role in achieving peace.\nWe also share with the United Nations its proper vision underlining the importance of effective collective action to face all challenges and dangers, foremost of which are the difficult conditions and severe developmental and human repercussions the world is experiencing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThis emerging challenge has proven that the international community is in dire need to put aside differences, to strengthen areas of human solidarity, to stand united in the face of these health threats, and to improve our future readiness to prevent such risks and properly fortify our societies.\nWe hail here the call of the Secretary-General of the United Nations for a ceasefire in all conflict areas in the world to confront the pandemic, a call that has gained widespread global acceptance.\nIn this important context, the Kingdom of Bahrain has been keen, since the first moments of the pandemic outbreak, to extend a hand of cooperation, solidarity and coordination with the countries of the world and its specialized organizations, such as the World Health Organization, in facing such difficult circumstances. We have formed a national team, headed by our Crown Prince, to develop and implement an integrated emergency plan, implementing many national measures, in line the best preventive and remedial practices, in order to preserve, first and foremost, the health and safety of citizens and residents alike. We have taken into account the urgent need to mitigate the economic and social impacts, and we are tirelessly working to diversify our supporting programs in that regard, with the aim of safeguarding the prosperity and stability of our dear people, and for a speedy recovery of our national economy.\nFrom of our keenness to preserve the security and stability of the region, and as an embodiment of our resolute approach to openness and coexistence with all, we have announced the establishment of relations with the State of Israel, sending a civilized message affirming that our hand is extended for a just and comprehensive peace, as it is the best guarantee for the future of all peoples of the region.\nThe courageous step taken by the brotherly United Arab Emirates to revive the hope of peace and stability in the region is a successful and blessed step. In reaching \u201chistoric peace agreement\u201d with Israel, under the auspices and efforts of the United States of America, in exchange for stopping Israel\u2019s annexation of the Palestinian lands, the UAE has enhanced opportunities for peace, reduced tensions, and given the people of the region a new era of understanding, rapprochement and peaceful coexistence, while preserving its firm position on the Palestinian issue. We further commend the appreciated efforts exerted by the United States of America to accomplish these important strategic steps.\nIn this context, the Kingdom of Bahrain calls for intensified efforts to end the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in accordance with the two-state solution. We consider this a cornerstone for achieving a just and comprehensive peace leading to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, with East Jerusalem as its capital, based on the resolutions of international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative, in order enter a new stage of work in which we extend bridges of good neighborly relations to build and develop the common interests of the countries of the region.\nThis is a good opportunity to use this important platform, to express our deep appreciation for the pioneering role and hard work of the brotherly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, led by our brother, the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman bin Abdulaziz A1 Saud, not only in terms of laying the foundations for security and peace in the region and the world as a whole, in a manner that takes into account the interest of all parties, but also for the remarkable and influential efforts made during its current presidency of the G20 to formulate a \u201cnew decade\u201d, in which the aspirations of the peoples of the world for prosperity and stability will be fulfilled. In doing so, we underline the firm approach of our country to stand alongside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on all positions and in all circumstances.\nWe also cannot fail to express our full support for the continuous efforts of the brotherly Arab Republic of Egypt to consolidate regional security and stability, and its genuine endeavors to achieve peace, the most recent being the initiative of our brother President Abdel Fattah al Sisi, which gave hope to the brotherly Libyan people to confront and resist foreign interference, and has contributed to rebuilding the capabilities of the region\u2019s countries, based on Egypt\u2019s pioneering role in protecting and maintaining Arab national security.\nMr. President, Distinguished Audience,\nThe success and prosperity of societies is linked to their achievement of security and stability, and this is what the Kingdom of Bahrain has always pursued.\nAnd as an active country within the wider international community, it underlines the need to accelerate efforts to achieve our human prosperity by strengthening areas of solidarity and consensus under the umbrella of global goals. We have committed ourselves to this since the foundation of this long-standing organization, which we congratulate on the anniversary of its establishment and for its renewed start at this crucial moment of our contemporary history.\nWe are proud of the part we play in this, and we are committed to our support for the United Nations in order to reach our desired destination and achieve the legitimate aspirations of people and rebuild bridges of trust and love, so as to reach a more secure, stable and peaceful world.\nThank you, Mr. President, and may peace be upon you."
